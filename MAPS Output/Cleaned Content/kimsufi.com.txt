Our cookie usage policy details the ways in which companies under the OVH Group use your browsing data and any other data associated with using and accessing websites and other media (advertising banners, emails, etc.) from the OVH Group, directly or through advertising content on other websites. You will also find information on your rights, and how to exercise them. This data is communicated in compliance with the regulations in effect, particularly the European directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of private lives in the electronic communications sector ( 2002/58/EC ), which outlines that storage, collection and access to data on your device is permitted under the condition that you have received information on the purposes of this data being processed, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ( the GDPR ), and subject to essential cookies that you have consented to. 1. The various cookies Under the terms of this policy, the terms "cookies and other trackers" or "cookies" refer to all of the trackers left and read while users browse websites and other media from the OVH Group within the European Union, and member states of the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes HTTP cookies, flash cookies, tags (also known as invisible pixels and web bugs), scripts, and fingerprinting results. This policy applies, regardless of whether or not the data collected by the cookies is personal. A cookie is a small piece of data that can be sent by websites via your browser. Cookies are stored on your device (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.) when you visit certain websites. Cookies allow companies to store and gather data regarding website visitors' browsing habits and hardware, then recognise the visitor using the data gathered. The data collected through these cookies may concern the number of pages visited, the language chosen, the city that your IP address is connected to, the frequency and recurrence of your visits, visit duration, the browser used, and the operator or device type that is being used to visit the website. Otherwise known as pixel tags, invisible pixels, clear GIFs, web bugs or web beacons, web tags are small pieces of autonomous code, or an image present on certain pages to monitor and track traffic. Fingerprinting creates a unique ID for the server browsing a webpage based on elements of its configuration, for tracking purposes. 2. The cookies used on OVH Group websites Generally, there are different reasons for using cookies. (A) Certain cookies are necessary for the OVH Group websites to work properly, and for enabling you to access and log in to your account using essential features.

Takes into account the user's acceptance or refusal with regards to analysing the data collected on the website.

They are used to deliver you more adapted content by: Collecting visitor data regarding the use of the website visited.Tracking clicks that direct to the website concerned.Improving the relevance of digital campaigns.Identifying website visitors redirected via an advertising campaign displayed on a third-party website. (D) Other cookies allow users to share OVH content on social networks and other third-party websites ( “ third-party cookies ”). These cookies allow users to access and use software tools and platforms (such as social networks, video streaming solutions, etc.) offered by third parties, make the website more user-friendly, and help it get promoted via OVH website content being shared on third-party platforms. In this case, data related to website visitors, their browsing and their actions associated with the content they are interacting with is accessible by these third-party platforms. OVH Group websites insert different social modules and pixels that enable users to request content from the platforms that deliver it. In this case, the platforms delivering these modules are considered as data controllers under the GDPR when they determine the purposes and means of processing data in line with their confidentiality policy. For this reason, certain features on the website are dependent on services offered by these third parties, and leave cookies. The websites delivering these third-party cookies, app buttons and extensions may request for users to log in via the button, even when the user does not use it while they browse the website. In compliance with regulations, they are also used with your consent . OVHcloud strongly recommends reading the confidentiality policies for these third parties: This section details the cookies and other trackers identified on OVH Group websites.

Cookies and third-party media Entities in the OVH Group are presented in different types of media (websites, social networks, etc.) managed by third parties, on which they publish content and launch campaigns that display advertising messages. When you view or interact with OVH content or advertising shared on third-party media, this browsing data can be communicated to OVH (namely via the use of Pixels). Its purpose is to ensure that the content and campaigns shared are relevant (e.g. knowing if you have visited our website or viewed certain pages after an advertising campaign). The diffusion of OVH advertising on third-party media may be linked due to the fact that the cookies stored on your device (e.g. a cookie left during a previous visit to an OVH Group website) reflect a potential interest in products and services from the OVH Group. Moreover, when you visit third-party media, cookies may be installed on your device. To find out more, please read the usage policies for cookies that apply to the third parties. 4.How do I manage cookies? In compliance with regulation (EU) 2016/679 relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free circulation of this data (the GDPR), the agreement of the users whose data will be processed must be expressed by using the correct settings on a browser or other application. Browser settings Browsers offer a number of rules allowing users to express their choices in terms of cookies. Regardless of their purpose, you can authorise, block and delete cookies stored on your device by setting your browser options. For the latest browsers, you will find indications via the following links: Finally, please note that disabling a cookie may stop you from being able to browse the website and use the services it offers, or make them more difficult to use. For further information on this, please read part 2 above, entitled "Cookies used by the OVH Group websites". Managing scripts, tags and banner cookies OVH uses a tag management solution that centralises scripts, and as a result, the collection of your consent in accordance with the terms and conditions and usage that enable you to use a user-friendly, intuitive solution. This means you can manage the various features that leave cookies (adverts, social media buttons, videos and other modules inserted into the website's pages) by centralising the area for collecting consent via the cookie banner. 5. Exercising your rights In compliance with the legislation related to the protection of personal data, you have the right to access, rectify, oppose, limit and delete personal data concerning your identity. This may be exercised in application of the previous point of the cookie policy, or by contacting the person delegated for data protection via the form designed for this purpose.
