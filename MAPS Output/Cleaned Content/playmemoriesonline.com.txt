Sony’s Card Marketing and Services Company, the Sony Rewards Program, and other SEL affiliated companies ( “Affiliates” ) offer their own independent websites, apps and online features, including some that are linked to/from the Properties, and have their own privacy policies. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Sony Group” companies include Sony Corporation (or its successor) and those companies owned or controlled by Sony Corporation (or its successor), directly or indirectly, including Affiliates and others which share the “SONY” branding. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the applicable terms and conditions applicable to the Properties you may use, including the Terms and Conditions for our website, which govern your use of the Properties and any related services. This Privacy Policy explains: State Notices Collection of Information We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit or use the Properties, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” and some of which may be considered “sensitive” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, phone number, e-mail address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. If we combine information we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat that combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a “hash.” Such codes do not identify you directly, but may be used to connect your activity and interests. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. Information You Provide To SEL When you interact with SEL or our Properties, we may ask you to provide various information, including contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, and telephone number) and other information about yourself, such as demographic information (i.e., gender, zip code, age, etc.), or certain information about your preferences and interests. We may also ask you to provide additional information in connection with a feature or service we offer. For example, if you are registering a product, we may collect device or service information, or, if you make a purchase, we will collect payment information and related transaction information. If you contact our customer service centers for assistance by any means, including written communications or via our chat features, support forums, telephone, email, or social media channels, we may collect your phone number, record and use customer service calls or chats (where permitted by applicable law), or ask for device identifiers, such as an IMEI number from a mobile device. We may collect other information that you may provide to us in connection with the service request, including information about your health conditions, such as information about your hearing in connection with our hearing aid products. Some of our customer service processes, including chatbots and call/chat monitoring and recording, are operated by third party service providers. Content you provide to us by any channel may be sent to and stored by our third party service providers. Through certain features or in the course of providing services to you, you may also provide us with photos and videos or other content. Please note that if you upload content or provide us with photos or videos, such images may include metadata which can reveal information about the images, including but not limited to, where and when they were taken. Information That SEL May Collect Automatically In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, whenever you visit or interact with the Properties or our content, SEL, as well as our third-party analytics and advertising providers or other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Properties are accessed and used ( “Usage Information" ).Usage Information may include, without limitation, browser type, operating system, the page served, time spent on the Properties, the pages you have viewed, and location information. SEL may also automatically collect your IP address, or other unique device identifiers ( “Device Identifiers" ) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (each, a “Device" ) you use to access the Properties. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access the Properties or our servers, so that our systems can identify your Device. We may also collect an Advertising ID (such as the Android AAID), which is assigned by the platform operator for the applicable Device. In accordance with applicable law, (including with your consent if required), we may also automatically collect information related to your physical behavior or health, voice recognition and utterance data when using a voice command, or biometric information, such as voice authentication or fingerprint, for identification purposes. Third parties may also use technologies that automatically or passively collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit or use our Properties or other online websites and services. For example, some third parties' embedded content or plugins on the Properties, such as social media sharing tools, allow them to learn that you or your Device have visited or interacted with our Properties, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services. These third parties may handle this information, and other information they directly collect through their content and plugins, pursuant to their own privacy policies. The technologies used on the Properties to collect Usage Information and/or Device Identifiers by us or third parties include: Cookies. "Cookies" (which may be .html files, or other technology) are small text files that help store user preferences and activity.

Session replay technology, also referred to as session playback or user experience (UX) replay, collects information regarding and tracks your interactions with a website or application. It then transforms those logged user events (such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, scrolling, tapping, etc.) into a reproduction of what you actually did on the website or application. We use session replays for quality control, customer service, fraud prevention and security, and marketing purposes. Our session replay technology is owned and operated by a third-party who acts as our service provider. The information collected by this technology may be collected and stored by our third-party service provider. Location Data We may collect information about your location from your Device. In some cases, this may include the precise location of your Device. We may collect location information using different types of technologies, including IP address, GPS or Wi-Fi.
