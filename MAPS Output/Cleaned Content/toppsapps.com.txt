Classic TOPPS Meets the Digital Age In 2012, Topps launched its digital group, launching apps for both baseball and football enthusiasts. Since then the Topps Apps suite has quickly expanded to include titles across both sports and entertainment, providing users with a fun and interactive experience that marries the thrill of card collecting with the instant gratification of digital collectibles. Since those early beginnings, Topps has added some of the most notable sports (MLB, NHL®, MLS, UEFA) and entertainment (MARVEL, DISNEY, STAR WARS ™) properties, continuing to innovate and evolve what it means to be a modern day card collector. The apps showcase thousands of cards, original artwork, digitized classic Topps designs, digital signatures, video cards, and more! Proud partner of Follow Us!
