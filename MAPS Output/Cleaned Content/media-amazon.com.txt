Restricted Products Appeals On occasion, our systems may remove products that are permitted to be sold on our site. This may occur if there is incomplete or inaccurate product information provided to us, or if our systems incorrectly identify a product as restricted. For example, if there is a product with both general sale and prescription versions, we may restrict the product if we are unable to determine which version of the product is being offered. Also note that some products that are legal are still prohibited per Amazon's policies. Sellers who believe their product has been removed in error should contact Seller Support in order for the restriction to be reviewed. If the product is found to be permitted for sale, appropriate adjustments to our systems as well as to the seller's account status will be made, as applicable. Please note that moving a restricted product listing to Out of Stock (OOS) does not make the listing compliant. Failure to properly close or delete all restricted product listings from your inventory may result in the removal of your selling privileges. If you think your product was incorrectly identified as a restricted product on Amazon, close the listing immediately to ensure compliance while you appeal the restriction with Selling Partner Support.
