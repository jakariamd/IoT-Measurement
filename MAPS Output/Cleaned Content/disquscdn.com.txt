Our Community Philosophy Disqus Channels are places for people to talk about things that matter to them. They should be friendly, open, and easy to use. Each channel gathers around a central topic (it could be fashion, movies, or tech), and should aim to foster great conversations. The best discussions teach you something, make you laugh, or make you think. It's your job to help those discussions Ô¨Çourish. But to make a community thrive, there have to be certain rules in place. Rules‚Ä¶? Don't worry, they're pretty straightforward. There are 3 types of rules for Disqus communities: Terms of Service (TOS) Basic Rules Home Rules Terms of Service Our TOS apply to every person that uses the Disqus product, on any site. They cover a lot technical and/or legal situations. If you're being really bad and all else fails, we invoke these. It's our version of Federal law. Basic Rules The Basic Rules also apply to anyone using Disqus, but cover more community-focused behaviors. Spam Impersonation Direct threat of harm Personally identiÔ¨Åable information posted without consent Inappropriate proÔ¨Åle content These are not allowed across all counties of Disqus. This is our version of State Law. Home Rules Home Rules apply to all communities on disqus.com. Like the channel you're leading! It's like when you visit a friend's house, and they ask you to remove your shoes before coming inside. They're our, well, house rules. Home Rules tl;dr 1. Stay On-topic 2. No Self-promotion 3. Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely 4. Don't Be a Jerk 5. Don't Copy and Paste 6. English Only Home Rules Stay On-Topic Be sure your topic matches the general theme of the channel. For example, all discussions on Talk Shop should pertain to fashion and beauty. Not sure if you're posting to the right channel? Check the channel's About section, or recently-added topics to get an idea of what subjects are appropriate. No Self-promotion A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed. Home Rules Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inÔ¨Çame will always be removed. Don't Be a Jerk Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments or discussions written intentionally to provoke will also be removed. Home Rules Don't Copy and Paste If you didn't write it, or haven't properly cited the article you're quoting, don't post it. English Only We currently only support English-only discussions on Disqus channels. Non-English comments and discussions will be removed. Those are the fundamentals. Now, let's dig into the speciÔ¨Åcs of your role. Good moderation is key for a successful community. Moderators Should Be: Empathetic Articulate Respectful Patient Objective Enthusiastic And they should be well versed in a handful of situations and features. Moderation Situations ‚Ä¢ Removing Discussions ‚Ä¢ Removing Comments ‚Ä¢ Blacklisting Users ‚Ä¢ Intervention ‚Ä¢ Escalating Issues Removing Discussions There are two types of discussions that require removal: off-topic and self-promoting/spam discussions. The process for removing both is the same: 1. Post a canned response 2. Close the thread 3. Remove the discussion Spotting Self-promotion (continued) 1. If you strip out the thing that's being shared, does it still make for a good discussion? 2. Is the creator's proÔ¨Åle a name of a brand, business? Check website link on their proÔ¨Åle Look at previous history of comments Spotting Self-promotion 3. Is the discussion just a link to an external article/site? Then it's probably self-promotion. 4. A really long discussion (500+ comments) that is written like a blog post may have been copy-pasted from elsewhere. To check, copy a distinctive paragraph or group of sentences and search for it in Google.Handling Off-topic Discussions A user is earnestly trying to start a good discussion, but they're on the wrong channel. 1. Leave a comment redirecting them to the appropriate channel. 2. Close the thread, but don't delete it right away - give them a chance to recreate their discussion easily. Canned Responses Off-topic: "Hi @username, this comment is being deleted because it has veered off-topic. Opinions are cool, but we just ask that comments relate to the topic. Please review the Home Rules before rejoining. Thanks!" *** "Hey @username, this sounds like it could be a really interesting discussion, but since this is off-topic to [Love Stinks] - a community for discussions on dating and relationships - I'll be closing the thread. Feel free to re-post this to to [Squid] instead!" Canned Responses Self Promotion: Hi @username, I've closed this discussion for self- promotion. Self-promotion is Ô¨Åne but if you're just submitting your links without intending to start a discussion, the thread will be closed. Please review our Home Rules. Thanks! Removing Comments Comments should be removed because: they're spam violate community guidelines are nonsensical. When to Remove Spam (Hint: always) Is someone offering to help you make $40/hr by working at home? 1. Blacklist the user 2. Mark the comment as spam When to Remove a Comment (That isn't spam) Does the comment include: personal insults racist remarks sexist remarks Is the comment: upsetting users attacking another user Ô¨Çagged multiple times REMOVE IT But, First! Reply to the commenter to let them know why the comment was removed. Great example of being human, while enforcing rules: Then delete the comment. If bad behavior persists, ban them. What Do Nonsensical Comments Look Like? Just delete these, no warning necessary. Handling Non-English Content As Disqus is only able to operate in English currently, remove any non-English comments or discussions. Optionally, you can also post the following canned response: "Hi @username, thanks for creating a discussion! Just a friendly reminder that we are an English only site, so this discussion will be closed. Feel free to take a look at the Home Rules before re-joining the discussions." How to Judge Profanity Curse words are acceptable so long as the intent is not to personally attack another user. vs. How to Judge Profanity Exceptions: In some communities there may be a case where swear words negatively detract from the type of community you're striving to build. For example, a parenting or health channel. How to Handle: In general, curse words are okay. But, excessive use of curse words or profanity used to attack should be removed. A warning should be issued in both cases. When to Blacklist a User Is the commenter a spammer? Blacklist them. Is the commenter disruptive or posting inÔ¨Çammatory comments? Warn them once. If behavior persists, blacklist them. When to Intervene You should step in when two or more users are having an argument that is: inÔ¨Çammatory, off-topic, contains personal insults, or violates guidelines in some way. 1. Reply to all users involved that their comment, along with the rest of the subthread, will be removed. 2. Remove all comments from the subthread, including your own. When to Escalate 1. Is it a situation you don't know how to approach, or don't feel comfortable getting involved in? 2. Do you think a more serious TOS violation is taking place? 3. Is there bulk spam that needs extra attention? How to Escalate 1. Ask other mods for advice in the #channel-mods Slack channel. 2. Reach out to your Disqus employee contact directly. Now you know when to moderate. Let's talk about how to moderate.
