We‚Äôre happy to answer any of your questions anytime. Before we start, if you haven‚Äôt already, you‚Äôll need to sign-up here . Once you‚Äôre signed up it‚Äôs time to get started. The process is simple and pretty straightforward. Simply: Customize your privacy policyAdd the privacy policy to your siteUpdate and refine your policy when needed üí° If you already have a similar site/policy, you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch: you can take advantage of the site duplication feature . 1.Create and customize your privacy policy Your privacy policy needs to be adapted to your site‚Äôs or app‚Äôs data collection practices. You do that by adding a service. Services generally fall into two categories: Services related to your own data collection activities (eg. contact forms)Services related to third-party data collection activities (eg. Google Analytics) We‚Äôve added a Site Scanner within the services window of the generator which allows you to quickly inspect your site in real-time and identify which services you need to add to your policy. Do note that although our scanner is powerful, it can only scan for technologies that are directly integrated on your pages . You will, therefore, still need to add manually the clauses that relate to data processing practices like newsletter sending. When figuring out which basic services to add to your policy, it may help to ask yourself the following questions: What user data do I collect myself and how do I collect it? Eg. newsletter forms, contact forms, comment systems. Which third-party services do I use on my site/app? Most likely these services also process user data in some way and therefore must be included in your policy. Some common ones are: Social widgets (e.g Facebook like/share button, Twitter tweet button, Pinterest ‚Äúpin it‚Äù button); External account access services : services that let you access the user‚Äôs account on another platform (e.g. Facebook account access, Twitter account access); Payment processing services (e.g. Stripe, PayPal); Tracking and analytics (e.g Google Analytics, Piwik, WordPress Stats). Please note: if using tracking, you‚Äôll likely need to include a cookie notice and implement a cookie solution on your site); Email & newsletter management services (e.g Constant Contact, MailChimp, Mad Mimi, AWeber): Ad services (e.g Google Adsense, Google Ads, AdButler). For which purposes do I collect these data? In most cases, the purpose of the data collection is standard and automatically included within the services added, however, there are some instances where you‚Äôre required to add additional disclosures. Some common ones are: Selling goods and services onlineDirect Email Marketing (DEM) purposes ( monetizing your newsletter or promoting third-party products and services) You can also easily add custom services by simply filling out the built-in form . You can read more about what you‚Äôre legally required to disclose and obtain consent for in our Getting Started Guide . üá∫üá∏ Have you or your customers based in the US? 2. Add the privacy policy to your site When the privacy policy is ready it needs to be added to the site. This is done by using the embedding code we provide. You can make the privacy policy available on your site/ app in the following ways: as a button with a modal window (included in the standard free version);as a direct link (e.g. for App Stores);or as a direct site embed (that shows your privacy policy as a part of your website). The video below shows how you can easily add the privacy policy to your website: Additional links you might find useful here are: 3. Update and refine your policy when needed We constantly monitor the major legal regulations and automatically update your policy to keep it valid and up-to-date, however, should you need to manually update your personal information, contact details, custom clauses or add additional services, you can simply log back into your iubenda dashboard and make changes anytime.

The CPRA is now actively monitored and enforced by the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), issuing fines or penalties for non-compliance. Please be informed that following the decision of the Sacramento County Superior Court, the enforcement of the final regulations issued by the California Privacy Protection Agency has been delayed to March 29, 2024.

Simply select US State Laws in your generator to comply with the main regulations across the US. Detailed disclosures via Privacy Policy US Requirement Businesses must include specific disclosures in their privacy policies. These disclosures include descriptions of consumer rights, processing partners, purposes, sources and more. This information must be complete, up-to-date and easily accessible throughout your website/app. Policies are invalid if they're missing the right information In order to be compliant, your policy must at the very least contain: Your Privacy Policy under the CPRA (CCPA amendment): Include the categories of personal information that your business has sold or shared with third parties in the last 12 months, a list of relevant third parties, and your business purpose. You also need to disclose if you have not sold or shared users‚Äô personal information within the last 12 months.Add a statement regarding whether or not your business knowingly sells or shares the personal information of users under the age of 16. Include the categories of personal information that your business has disclosed (for business purposes) to third parties in the last 12 months, a list of relevant third parties, and your business‚Äôs purpose. You shall also disclose if you have not disclosed consumers‚Äô personal information in the preceding 12 months.State whether or not your business uses or discloses sensitive personal information for purposes other than those specified in the act. Provide any links to online request forms or portals so your users can make requests regarding their personal information being collected, disclosed, or sold. Here is the full checklist of information that you must include in your privacy policy according to the CPRA requirements. Your Privacy Policy under the VCDPA: Include the categories of personal data processed by your organization.Include your organization‚Äôs purpose for processing personal data.Inform your users of how they may exercise their rights (see below), including how they can appeal a decision on their requests. You must provide one or more methods for users to submit a request.Include the categories of personal data that your organization shares with third parties, if any.Include the categories of third parties, if any, with whom your organization shares personal data. Solution Privacy and Cookie Policy Generator Display notice and allow Opt-out CPRA requirement The CPRA (CCPA amendment) requires you to display a notice at or before the point of collection which informs consumers of which categories of personal information will be collected and the purposes for the collection. Consumers must also be allowed to opt-out of this processing. As a business you are therefore responsible for informing consumers of this option and providing the actual means for opt-out. In particular, you must: Detect whether or not a consumer is California-based and whether or not they‚Äôve visited your website beforeFacilitate opt-out requests via a DNSMPI linkInstruct relevant third-parties to cease processing the consumer's information when an opt-out request is received.Serve them a notice at first site visit containing the necessary disclosures VCDPA requirement Please be informed that under the VCDPA, there are no indications that opt-out links enabling users to opt-out of the processing of personal data for certain purposes are required . The provisions of the VCDPA, in fact, treat users‚Äô opt-out rights in the same manner as any other users‚Äô rights granted under the Act. Your business needs to comply with users‚Äô requests as follows: You need to comply with the request within 45 days.The response period may be extended one time by 45 additional days when reasonably necessary, as long as you inform your user of any extension within the initial 45-day response period, together with the reason for the extension;If you decline to take action regarding your users‚Äô request, inform the user of such rejection within 45 days, indicating the relevant justification and instructions on how to appeal the decision; If you are unable to authenticate a request using commercially reasonable efforts, you are not required to comply with the request, and you may ask for additional information, which is reasonably necessary to authenticate the user and its request. Solution Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution for CPRA and VCDPA Notify consumers and manage opt-out. IAB CCPA (CPRA) Compliance Framework integrated. Our solution lets you: Display a consent banner to inform users Display a "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" ( DNSMPI ) link in the notice and elsewhere on your site/app thereby supporting opt-out from sale Automatically detect and apply the correct standards (including multiple standards) based on location. Our solution allows you to apply both CPRA (CCPA amendment) and GDPR standards to the same users when legally required Easily register and automatically pass user preferences (like opt-out) to ad vendors who support the IAB CCPA (CPRA) Compliance Framework (like Google and AdRoll) iubenda‚Äôs Cookie Solution supports Opt-out Preference Signals like the GPC and GPP as required under the CPRA Keep up-to-date records for manual opt-out US Requirement As mentioned above, similary to the CPRA (CCPA amendment), most of these state laws grant users the right to opt out . In cases where the processing is somewhat manual (i.e not related to onsite scripts such as in the case of Direct email marketing) businesses may need to manually implement the opt-out request. Furthermore, laws like the CPRA mandates that users may not be contacted for a minimum of 12 months after the request. For this reason it's prudent to keep records of opt out details such as the particular user, the date, and sub-contractors to be notified in the case of requests. Solution Consent Database Register of Data Processing Activities Our Register of Data Processing Activities lets you accurately record relevant details necessary for fulfilling Consumer requests with precision. The Solution records: security details such as which members of your organization has access to user data;any registered sub-contractors processing on your behalf;manually added purposes for the processing;data collection methods and more. Penalties and fines for non-compliance Civil penalty of $2,500 per violation or; $7,500 per violation if it is intentional or involves the personal information of a child. Civil penalty of up to $7,500 for each violation. While these fines might not seem like a lot when compared to other privacy laws, do consider that these fines apply per individual violation and per consumer . For a business with even just a few customers, these fines can add up to a hefty sum. Overall, what are the main requirements for websites and app owners? Sharing and profiling If you have users from the US, then you may need to comply with laws like the CPRA & VCDPA when it comes to profiling or sharing user information. This means that you must inform users that you‚Äôre processing their data this way and give them the ability to stop sharing (opt out). Consent Records Some regions like Europe and Brazil require you to keep consent proofs (also known as records of consent). In many cases, without these records, the consents you collect may be considered invalid ‚Äî placing you in violation of the law. Cross-region requirements If you have users from various regions (e.g Europe and the US) then you may need to simultaneously comply with laws from multiple regions like California‚Äôs CPRA or Europe‚Äôs GDPR. This means having region-specific disclosures available in your privacy documents and more.

It is intended to strengthen data protection for all people whose personal information fall within its scope of application, putting personal data control back into their hands. The aforementioned can, however, be a technical challenge to implement in practical terms. This is especially true for your register of data processing activities. Users must be able to describe which data they collect, for which purposes, the parties involved and some other details for the entire company, including data of employees.If you are looking for further background information on the GDPR please have a look at our extensive GDPR guide . This guide is meant to guide you step by step through our Register of Data Processing Activities. Please note: Even though the GDPR is a common reason to put more effort into your register of data processing activities, our tool is not exclusively made for application under the GDPR. It can also be used for all your data processing activities in general, even by companies who do not have any users/customers within the EU. Keep reading or view the full tutorial . Does my organization need to keep records of processing activities under the GDPR? The GDPR requires both controllers and processors to keep a record of processing activities. Such records need to be in writing, including in electronic form. The IPM was specifically designed for controllers and processors to meet this requirement. The record (also called ‚Äúregister‚Äù) of processing activities needs to be made available to the supervisory authority if requested. When is my organization exempt from this requirement? Enterprises or organizations that employ less than 250 persons are exempted from this requirement. üëâ However, if you employ less than 250 persons but match one of the following, you are required to fulfill this requirement of the GDPR: the processing it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjectsthe processing is not occasional, ORthe processing includes special categories of data, as referred to in Article 9(1) , or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses referred to in Article 10 . What does the concept of area mean? Areas are perimeters within which data processing activities are homogeneous. Examples of areas are your website, mobile app, physical stores, employees, recruiting, manufacturing facility etc. For each, you can provide a description of how data is being processed, just like you are doing probably already with our privacy policy generator or the terms of service generator for any given site. In short, areas are replications of the ‚Äòsite‚Äô entity that are connected to each other, that you can create at will. How are members/roles defined? At the account level you‚Äôre able to add members, who can then be associated with a particular role (such as ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù, ‚Äúprocessor etc.) or a specific area. When associating, you can choose what role the member has within the following options: Controller: means any person or legal entity involved in determining the purpose and ways of processing personal data. Member of the controller‚Äôs organization: see list of examples below Processor: means any person or legal entity involved in processing personal data on behalf of the controller Subject (sometimes also called user): means an individual whose personal data is processed by a controller or processor. For example, an internet company may collect user information via their website and store it using a 3rd party cloud service. In this scenario, the internet company is the data controller and the organization running the cloud service is the data processor. You can think of it as basically an address book. All current owners are members too. Please be aware: The defaults that you put in the area members section are then applied by default to each service. The following members are available by default: EmployeesUsersEU UsersMarketing DepartmentHR DepartmentFinance DepartmentCustomer Care DepartmentSales DepartmentR&D DepartmentDevelopment DepartmentProduct DepartmentLegal DepartmentPR DepartmentIntelligence Department How can I configure services with the new fields? Your privacy policy needs to be adapted to your site‚Äôs or app‚Äôs data collection practices. You do that by adding a service. Services generally fall into two categories: Services related to your own data collection activities (eg. contact forms)Services related to third-party data collection activities (eg. Google Analytics) When figuring out which basic services to add to your policy, it may help to ask yourself the following questions: What user data do I collect myself and how do I collect it?(eg. newsletter forms, contact forms, comment systems)Which third-party services do I use on my site/app? Most likely these services also process user data in some way and therefore must be included in your policy. In the following section, we will go through the new fields that we have released to facilitate your register of data processing activities (you can find these fields in the customization window that shows up when you add a service). This will be done step by step in order to assist you in choosing the right option for your personal situation. Label and Description Those 2 fields are simply for your convenience to be able to describe the given service. An example for a label could be ‚ÄúDE data center‚Äù and the corresponding description could be ‚ÄúFrankfurt data center‚Äù.Region This is a field that only applies to some services where you can specify if you are keeping data in the EU. A good example of this is ‚ÄúAmazon Web services‚Äù (often abbreviated as ‚ÄúAWS‚Äù). Custom personal data A field that only some services have, that allows you to specify the personal data type collected through that service. Legal basis for processing data Under the GDPR, data can only be processed if there‚Äôs at least one lawful basis for doing so. The lawful bases are: The user has given consent for one or more specific purposes.The data processing is necessary for the performance of a contract in which the user is a participant or necessary in order to take steps (requested by the user) prior to entering the contract.The processing is necessary for fulfilling a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject.The processing is necessary for protecting the vital interests of the user or of another person.The processing is necessary for performing a task carried out in the interest of the public or as contained under the official authority given to the data controller. The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the data controller or third party, except where overridden by the interests, rights and freedoms of the user, in particular where the user is a child. In our tool you can select from the following options: Consent: Consent means offering individuals real choice and control. Genuine consent should put individuals in charge, build trust and engagement, and enhance your reputation. This refers to all tracking tools that are cookie-based, for which you collect consent via the cookie banner. Contract: All that you need to do in order to provide the service (hosting, etc). You can rely on this lawful basis if you need to process someone‚Äôs personal data: to fulfil your contractual obligations to them; orbecause they have asked you to do something before entering into a contract (for example providing a quote). Legal obligation: You can rely on this lawful basis if you need to process the personal data to comply with a common law or statutory obligation. This refers to invoicing for example. Vital interest: You are likely to be able to rely on the so-called vital interests as your lawful basis if you need to process the personal data to protect someone‚Äôs life. This processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably protect the person‚Äôs vital interests in another less intrusive way, this basis will not apply to your case. Public task: This is most relevant to public authorities, but it can apply to any organisation that exercises official authority or carries out tasks in the general public interest. Legitimate interest: Legitimate interests is certainly the most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always be the most appropriate for your case. It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people‚Äôs data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing. Special category data: Special category data is personal data which according to the GDPR is more sensitive, and therefore needs more protection. This includes for example information about an individual‚Äôs race, religion or health. Criminal offence data: To process personal data about criminal convictions or offences, you must have both a lawful basis under Article 6 and either legal authority or official authority for the processing under Article 10. Legal basis for data transfer outside of the EU This only applies when you are transferring data outside of the EU so please choose accordingly. You can choose between the following options: No data transfer: self-explanatory. Adequacy decisions: A decision adopted by the European Commission on the basis of Article 45 of Regulation (EU)2016/679, which establishes that a non-EU country ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data by reason of its domestic law or the international commitments it has entered into. Binding corporate rules: Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) are designed to allow multinational companies to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to their affiliates located outside of the EEA in compliance with the Article 47 of the GDPR. The procedure is designed to avoid you having to approach each individual data protection authority separately. Further information can be found under Article 47. Appropriate safeguards: In the absence of a adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an international organization only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. Further info can be found under Article 46. Consent: Consent means offering individuals real choice and control.Genuine consent should put individuals in charge, build trust and engagement, and enhance your reputation. This refers to all tracking tools that are cookie-based, for which you collect consent via the cookie banner. Standard data protection clauses adopted by the EU commission: The European Commission can decide that standard contractual clauses offer sufficient safeguards on data protection for the data to be transferred internationally. It has so far issued two sets of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from data controllers in the EU to data controllers established outside the EU or European Economic Area (EEA). Regulated by the GDPR and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 (Data Protection Regulation applicable to the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, ‚ÄúEUDPR‚Äù). Public interest: This is mostly relevant to public authorities, but it can apply to any organization that exercises official authority or carries out tasks in the general public interest. Establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims . Vital interest: You are likely to be able to rely on the so-called vital interests as your lawful basis if you need to process the personal data to protect someone‚Äôs life. This processing must be necessary. If you can reasonably protect the person‚Äôs vital interests in another less intrusive way, this basis will not apply to your case. Those related to the processing of personal data Controller Means any person or legal entity involved in determining the purpose and ways of processing the personal data. Processors Means any person or legal entity involved in processing personal data on behalf of the controller. Members of the controller organization A common example for this are the employees of the given company/organization. Subjects Can be for example either the users of the given website or app, visitors of a physical store or paying clients. Available rights Under normal circumstances, matters that have ‚Äúconsent‚Äù as the legal basis for processing, need to have all of the rights selected. Our solution offers you the following options: Information: Individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data. This is a key transparency requirement under the GDPR. Access: Individuals have the right to access their personal data and supplementary information. The right of access allows individuals to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing. Rectification: The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or completed if it is incomplete. An individual can make a request for rectification verbally or in writing. Erasure: The GDPR introduces a right for individuals to have personal data erased (also called the ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù). Individuals can make a request for erasure verbally or in writing. Restrict processing: Individuals have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data. This is however not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. More information can be found here. Data portability: The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services. It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without affecting its usability. Object: Individuals have the right to object to: processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling); direct marketing (including profiling); andprocessing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics. Retention policy This field refers to how long data is being stored. The default option is ‚Äúkeeping the data for the time necessary to fulfill the purpose‚Äù and should apply to most cases. Otherwise, you can choose from a period of 1 up to 5 years. Security measures Common examples here are the used encryption method or vulnerability assessments/penetration tests meaning that your technical systems should be tested periodically in order to evaluate the safety and resilience of your systems. Another important measure is the so-called ‚Äúbackup and storage of backup media‚Äù which means that it is advisable to keep the backup media in a dedicated place accessible only to the personnel in charge. The safety of the place should be verified at least annually. It is also recommended to install and maintain a firewall. It is advisable to review the current configurations, manage permissions for system users, check that the system is up to date and finally proceed with the installation on portable devices. Having a firewall in place is however obviously nothing new in relation to the GDPR and should be regarded as a minimum security measure already provided for by current standards.From the tool you will be able to choose from the following options: Encryption: Encryption is a broadly used process whereby data gets turned into an encoded and unintelligible version, using encryption algorithms and an encryption key, and whereby a decryption key or code enables others to decode it again. Anonymization: Recital 26 of the GDPR defines anonymized data as ‚Äúdata rendered anonymous in such a way that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable.‚Äù Pseudonymization: Pseudonymization is the separation of data from direct identifiers so that linkage to an identity is not possible without additional information that is held separately. It may therefore reduce the risks associated with data processing, while also maintaining the data‚Äôs utility. Auditing: Regular data audits alongside reviews and data management exercises are ongoing requirements to maintain compliance under the GDPR. Access limitation: This refers to limited access to any personally identifiable data that is collected or stored from any individual in the European Union. What does the button ‚ÄúAdding alternates‚Äù mean? To thoroughly describe the processing as required under the GDPR, you must be very granular in describing your data collection practices. A common scenario is that of a website having multiple contact forms, where each form is aimed at different individuals or for which the data is shared with different parties. Another example is having two different newsletters for different user-groups or customers. Our Register of Data Processing Activities tool therefore allows you to add different versions of the same service . Practical Examples Let‚Äôs now go through a range of specific examples to make the above information more practical including our ‚Äúalternate options‚Äù: Example Inc. adds a site area and configures the privacy policy, cookie policy, privacy controls and cookie solution, and the terms of service. For the privacy policy, the following is done: members: Here we set the global members for each role that is valid for the entire area.

As a result, many regions have put in place robust and enforceable data regulations by which businesses are expected to comply. In most cases, non-compliance with these regulations can not only lead to major financial consequences, but it can also lead to significant and lasting damage to public trust and the reputation of your organization. It is, therefore, important to ensure that your business meets its legal obligations.General Legal Requirements Major Components Under the vast majority of legislations, if you‚Äôre processing personal data you‚Äôre generally required to make disclosures related to your data processing activities via a comprehensive privacy policy , ensure that there are effective security measures in place for protecting personal data and implement methods for receiving user consent or facilitating its withdrawal. This privacy information must be up-to-date, understandable, unambiguous, and easily accessible throughout the website or app. Some component requirements may vary based on the type of processing activity, region, user age or business type. It is, therefore, worth noting that in addition to the general points outlined here, you may have further responsibilities depending on your law of reference. You can read more situation specific information in the sections below. Disclosures In general, users need to be informed of: Website/app owner detailsThe effective date of your privacy policyYour notification process for policy changesWhat data is being collectedThird-party access to their data (who the third-parties are and what data they‚Äôre collecting)Their rights in regards to their data. You may be further responsible for making additional disclosures to users, third-parties and the supervisory authority depending on your law of reference. One such law is the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) . Under the CCPA, users need to be informed, in particular, of the possibility of their data being sold ( you can think ‚Äúsold‚Äù here as ‚Äúshared with third parties for any profit, monetary or otherwise‚Äù). The disclosure needs to be visible from the homepage of the site and must include an opt-out ( DNSMPI ) link. You can read more about CCPA compliance here . Consent Consent here refers to the informed voluntary agreement of an individual to engage in a particular event or process. Broadly speaking, users need to be able to decline, withdraw or give (depending on the regional law) consent . Consent may be acquired using any method that would require the user to take a direct and verifiable affirmative action; these can include checkboxes, text fields, toggle buttons, sending an email in confirmation etc. Determining your law of reference Generally, the laws of a particular region apply if: You base your operations there; orYou use processing services or servers based in the region; orYour service targets users from that region This effectively means that regional regulations may apply to you and/or your business whether you‚Äôre located in the region or not. For that reason, it‚Äôs always advisable that you approach your data processing activities with the strictest applicable regulations in mind. You can read more about which laws apply to you here . Region-Specific Requirements ‚Äì US law In the US , there is no single comprehensive national body of data regulations; there are, however, various laws on a state level as well as industry guidelines and specific federal laws in place. Since online site/app activity is rarely limited to just one state, it‚Äôs always best to adhere to the strictest applicable regulations. With this in mind, the most robust data law framework is implemented by the state of California. The California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) , implemented in 2004, was the first state law to make privacy policies mandatory and it applies to person or company whose website/app processes the personal data of California residents. In addition to the generally required disclosures above , CalOPPA also requires that you: Conspicuously post your privacy policy on the homepage of your website/ appInclude in your privacy policy a description of the process by which users can request changes to personal data (if such a process exists)Include in your privacy policy a statement on how ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù requests are handled Notify affected users in the occurrence of security breaches that impact their data In regards to consent, US law generally requires that you give users a clear option for withdrawing consent (opt-out). Different rules apply, however, in cases involving ‚Äúsensitive data‚Äù (e.g. health information, credit reports, student data, personal information of children under 13). In such cases, there must be a verifiable opt-in action such as checking a box or some other affirmative action. Special Care Regarding Children If your service is knowingly collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from children under 13 , then special regulations apply to those data processing activities. Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act ( COPPA is a US federal law implemented to better protect the personal data and rights of children under 13 years of age.Under this law, if you operate a website or online service which is directed to children under 13, or you have actual knowledge that you‚Äôre collecting personal information from children under 13, you must give notice to parents and get their verifiable consent before collecting, using, or disclosing the information, and must keep the information collected secure . ‚ÄúVerifiable‚Äù here means using a method of attaining consent that is not easily faked by a child and that is demonstrably likely to be given by an adult (e.g. checking a form of government-issued ID against an applicable database). What is meant by the ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù of children ‚ÄúPersonal information‚Äù within this context refers to the child‚Äôs: Name or ID information (eg. social security number)Location info including physical address, geolocation data or IP addressAny contact information including phone numbers and email addressesDevice identifiersMedia containing the child‚Äôs image or voice, including photos, videos or audio files üí° Learn more about legal requirements regarding children and COPPA . Region-Specific Requirements ‚Äì EU law GDPR In the EU the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) was introduced in an effort to centralize data protection for people in the EU and became fully enforceable in May 2018 . At its most basic, it specifies how personal data should be lawfully processed (including how it‚Äôs collected, used, protected or interacted with in general). Where it applies The GDPR can apply where: An entity‚Äôs base of operations is in the EU (this applies whether the processing takes place in the EU or not);An entity not established in the EU offers goods or services (even if the offer is for free) to people in the EU. The entity can be government agencies, private/public companies, individuals and non-profits;An entity is not established in the EU but it monitors the behaviour of people who are in the EU, provided that such behaviour takes place in the EU. This scope effectively covers almost all companies and, therefore, means that the GDPR can apply to you whether your organization is based in the EU or not. Note: The protections of the GDPR also extend to users outside the EU if the data controller is EU based . Therefore, if you are an EU-based data controller you must, by default, apply GDPR standards to ALL your users. Where it does not apply The conditions of applicability of the GDPR are set from a material and a territorial point of view. To determine, whether or not a specific processing activity is exempt from its applicability, we have to consider both aspects. Material point of view The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data . Therefore, it does not apply to company data, such as a company name and address. Be careful here, however, because normally ‚Äúnatural persons‚Äù work in a company, any data referring to them would, therefore, be deemed ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù, regardless of whether they are processed in a Business to Customer (B2C) or Business to Business (B2B) context. Furthermore, personal data may not fall under the scope of the GDPR in several other scenarios including where they are processed by a natural person for a purely personal or household activity. You can read more about this in the dedicated guide here Territorial point of view In addition to and notwithstanding the above, we‚Äôve already mentioned under which conditions the GDPR applies . Consequently, for a processing activity not to be subjected to the GDPR from a territorial point of view, the following must apply cumulatively: the controller (or processor) is not based within the EU. Note: Always remember that the controller (or processor) could also be an EU-branch office of a non-EU corporation: in that case, even if the branch office were to have no legal personality, the GDPR would fully apply; the processing does not relate to the offering of goods or services (even for free) to data subjects in the Union or the monitoring of their behavior as far as it takes place within the Union; the controller is not based in an extra-EU place, where EU law applies due to international public law.

GDPR Requirements In general, the GDPR requires that you: Have a lawful basis. The GDPR requires that you have at least one lawful basis for processing user data. There are 6 lawful bases outlined under the GDPR. Acquire verifiable consent. Under the GDPR, consent is one of several legal/ lawful bases for processing user data and as such, it must be ‚Äúfreely given, specific, informed and explicit‚Äù.This means that the mechanism for acquiring consent must be unambiguous and involve a clear ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù action (the regulation specifically forbids pre-ticked boxes and similar ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù mechanisms). The GDPR also gives users a specific right to withdraw consent and, therefore, it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it. Because consent under the GDPR is such an important issue, it‚Äôs vital that you document and keep clear records related to the consent. Records of consent should at least contain the following information: The identity of the user giving consent;When they consented;What disclosures were made (what they were told) at the time they consented;Methods used for obtaining consent (e.g., newsletter form, during checkout etc.);Whether they have withdrawn consent or not Consent is not the ONLY reason that an organization can process user data; it is only one of the ‚Äúlegal bases‚Äù, therefore companies can apply other lawful (within the scope of GDPR) bases for data processing activity. With that said, there will always be data processing activities where consent is the only or best option. Many Data Protection Authorities across the EU have strengthened their requirements and aligned their rules on cookies and trackers with the requirements of the GDPR. More specifically, it‚Äôs required that you record and store proofs of your users‚Äô preferences. The Cookie and Consent Preference Log is now available in our Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution. Click here for more info on how to activate the Cookie and Consent Preference Log within your Privacy Controls and Cookie Solution. Data Subjects‚Äô rights Under the GDPR users have statutory rights in regards to their data. Not only must you as the controller honor those rights, but you must also inform users about them. Such rights include: The right to be informed In addition to the generally required disclosures outlined above, the GDPR further requires that you ensure that your privacy notices are concise, easy-to-understand and easily accessible throughout your website/app. The right of access Users have the right to access to their personal data and information about how their personal data is being processed. The right to rectification Users have the right to have their personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete. The right to object Under the GDPR, users have the right to object to certain activities in relation to their personal data. The right to data portability Under certain conditions, users have the right to obtain (in a machine-readable format) and use their personal data for their own purposes. The right to erasure When data is no longer relevant to its original purpose or where users have withdrawn consent, users have the right to request that their data be erased and all dissemination ceased. The right to restrict processing Users have the right to restrict the processing of their personal data in specific cases. Rights related to automated decision making and profiling Users have the right to not be subjected to a decision when it is based on automated processing or profiling, and it produces a legal or a similarly significant effect on the user. Meet specific requirements if transferring data outside of the EEA. The GDPR permits data transfers of EU resident data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) only when in compliance with set conditions. Implement privacy by design and default. Under the GDPR, data protection should be included from the onset of design and development of the business processes and infrastructure. Disclose security breaches. Under the GDPR, you are required to inform the supervisory authority of security breaches involving user data within 72 hours of becoming aware of it. In many cases you‚Äôre also required to inform affected users. Appoint a DPO (where certain conditions are met). Under certain conditions, you may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer, who will have the task to oversee all processing activities and monitor compliance with applicable law. Cases for mandatory appointment include situations where large-scale, systematic processing of user data occurs and where special categories of data (i.e. sensitive data) are being processed. Maintain records of processing activities. As stipulated in Article 30, the GDPR requires that you keep and maintain ‚Äúfull and extensive‚Äù up-to-date records of the particular data processing activities . Full and extensive records of processing are expressly required in cases where your data processing activities are not occasional , where they could result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of others, where they involve the handling of ‚Äúspecial categories of data‚Äù or where your organization has more than 250 employees ‚Äî this effectively covers almost all data controllers and processors .However, even if your processing activities somehow fall outside of these situations, your information duties to users make it necessary for you to keep basic records relating to which data you collect, its purpose, all parties involved in its processing and the data retention period ‚Äî this is mandatory for everyone. Read more about how to maintain compliant records for controllers and processors in our GDPR guide . Carry out a DPIA (where certain conditions are met). In cases where the data processing activity is likely to result in a high risk to users, the GDPR requires that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) be carried out. üí° You can read more about the GDPR here . ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law) Because using cookies means both processing user data and installing files that could be used for tracking, it is a major point of concern when it comes to user data privacy rights. The ePrivacy Directive (or Cookie Law was implemented to address this concern. Under the Cookie law, organizations that target users from the EU must inform users about data collection activities and give them the option to choose whether it‚Äôs allowed or not. This means that if your site/app (or any third-party service used by your site/app) uses cookies, you must first obtain valid consent prior to the installation of those cookies, except where those cookies fall into the category of exempt cookies . üí° To learn more about which EU cookie consent rules apply on a per-country basis, check out our Cookie Consent Cheatsheet here . Cookie banner So in practice, you‚Äôll need to show a banner at the user‚Äôs first visit, implement a cookie policy that contains all required information, and provide or inform users of the means by which they can refuse (or withdraw consent to) the processing. Prior to informed and explicit consent, no cookies ‚Äì except for exempt cookies ‚Äì can be installed. Cookie consent vs. ‚Äúregular‚Äù consent As mentioned above, ‚Äúconsent‚Äù is one of the six legal bases admitted by the GDPR and must be expressed and documented in very specific ways in order to be deemed valid. The question is: do you have to treat the consent to the use of cookies the same way as the ‚Äúregular‚Äù consent to specific data processing activities e.g. sending out newsletters If the answer were ‚Äúyes‚Äù, this would mean that you‚Äôd have to comply with all the extensive requirements for consent validity even when placing cookies, however, at the moment, most commentators agree that this would be both unfeasible and not what is intended by the EU legislator. Therefore, the simplified consent requirements under the ePrivacy Directive are still thought to be primarily applicable to the placing of cookies , due largely in part to the provision of GDPR-Article 95. However, please be aware that this is a hotly debated issue. This issue will only truly be resolved when the planned ePrivacy Regulation, currently still under development, is adopted. The banner must: briefly explain the purpose of the installation of cookies that the site uses;be sufficiently conspicuous so as to make it noticeable;link to (a cookie policy) or make available details of cookie purpose, usage and related third-party activity;clearly state which actions will indicate consent. Cookie policy The Cookie Policy must: describe in detail the purpose of installation of cookies;indicate all the third parties who install or that could install cookies, with a link to the respective privacy policy, the cookie policy, and any consent forms;inform the user of how they can exercise their right to refuse/withdraw consent. Blocking cookies before consent In compliance with the general principles of privacy legislation, which prevent processing before consent, the cookie law does not allow the installation of cookies before obtaining user consent. In practice, this means that you may have to employ a form of script blocking prior to user consent. Consent to cookies can be provided by several actions Subject to the local authority, these actions may include continued browsing, clicking on links or scrolling the page. In many cases, clicking on ‚Äúok‚Äù, closing the banner or continued navigation of a cookie-installing website can be considered active consent to the placing of cookies ‚Äî provided that users had been previously and clearly informed about this consequence . Exemptions to the consent requirement Some cookies are exempt from the consent requirement and therefore are not subject to preventive blocking (though you‚Äôre still required to inform users about your use of cookies ‚Äì see caution box below). The exemptions are as follows: Technical cookies strictly necessary for the provision of the service. These include preference cookies, session cookies, load balancing, etc.Statistical cookies managed directly by you (not third-parties), providing that the data is not used for profiling *Anonymized statistical third-party cookies (e.g.Google Analytics) * *This exemption may not be applicable for all regions and is therefore subject to specific local regulations. Caution The exemption to the consent requirement only clearly applies to non-tracking technical cookies strictly necessary for the functioning of services that were expressly requested by the user. A real-world example of this would be an e-commerce site that allows users to ‚Äúhold‚Äù items in their cart while they‚Äôre using the site or for the duration of a session. In this scenario, the technical cookies are both necessary for the functioning of the purchasing service and are explicitly requested by the user when they indicate that they would like to add the item to the cart. Do note, however, that these session-based technical cookies are not tracking cookies . Other examples of these technical cookies would be user-centric session-based cookies used to detect authentication abuses, load-balancing session cookies, and Multimedia player session cookies related to and necessary for the provision of services requested by the user. So does this mean that I don‚Äôt need to have a Cookie Banner in such cases? Firstly, it‚Äôs critical to note that even where this exception to the consent requirement applies, you‚Äôll still need to inform the user of your use of cookies via a cookie policy.The banner is not necessarily required in this specific instance if the cookie policy is easily accessible and visible from every page of the site. In future, the ePrivacy Directive will be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation and as such, will work alongside the GDPR. The upcoming regulation is expected to still uphold the same values as the directive. Situational Legal Requirements E-commerce These requirements are typically addressed via a valid, up-to-date terms and conditions document (also called ToS ‚Äì terms of service, terms of use, or EULA ‚Äì end user license agreement). In addition to the disclosures and requirements outlined above (and subject to your law of reference), if operating an e-commerce website or app, you‚Äôre further subject to the applicable commercial laws and industry rules. Regarding B2B commerce Generally, those involved in B2B commercial transactions will be subject to whichever contract, industry and national guidelines are applicable. However, participating in B2B commerce often requires that personal data be processed (be it that of employees or otherwise), in such cases, and where the processing falls within its scope , the GDPR applies and takes precedence. Regarding B2C commerce Under most countries‚Äô consumer laws, when selling to consumers , in addition to the default required privacy disclosures , you‚Äôll need to inform customers of the following: Returns/Refund details ; Warranty/ Guarantee information (where applicable); Safety information, including instructions for proper use (where applicable); Terms of delivery of product/ service; Identifying information such as a legal address and business name; Rights of consumers (such as withdrawal rights ), where applicable; Seller contact details (e.g. email address). US law In general, at least at the federal level, there are no rules in the United States that require businesses to include a terms and conditions document in their websites, as mandatory disclosures are mainly regulated on a state-by-state basis. While e-commerce disclosure requirements come into consideration primarily at the state level, it is best practice and in businesses‚Äô interest to include certain information in the Terms and Conditions document. It is advisable for businesses to include provisions that protect their activity, such as limitations of liability, declaration of applicable law and jurisdiction, and a clear delivery and return policy. How iubenda can help you iubenda allows you to include different US-specific clauses in your Terms and Conditions: DMCA clauses : the Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safe harbor for copyright infringement liability to online service providers that meet certain requirements (in order to qualify for safe harbor protection, service providers‚Äîfor example, those that allow users to post or store material on their systems, search engines, directories, and other information location tools‚Äî must, among others, designate an agent to receive notifications of claimed copyright infringements, disclose designated agent‚Äôs contact information and add a DMCA-specific policy); How to find the related clause: Content rights ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí DMCA clause Exclusion of countries on a US sanctions list (if you are based or conduct business in the US) : you can add a statement ruling out users: a) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ‚ÄúState Sponsor of Terrorism‚Äù; or b) included in any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.Note that, for example, this is a requirement mandated by Apple for apps distributed via the Apple App Store; How to find the related clauses: Mobile app ‚Üí Base statements ‚Üí Base clause for apps distributed via the Apple App Store Target audience ‚Üí Other ‚Üí Exclude geographies that are on a US sanction/embargo list Price displaying: in general, applicable laws might determine specific requirements on how prices must be displayed.

With iubenda, on a voluntary basis, you may decide to extend the guarantee of conformity according to EU legislation to non-EU consumers.Obviously, this benefit may not prevent those consumers from enjoying any broader guarantee rights pursuant to their applicable law, if any; How to find the related clause: Business model, payments and user rights ‚Üí General commerce and business model ‚Üí Goods ‚Üí Guarantees related to goods ‚Üí Mandatory guarantee of conformity for goods for European consumers ‚Üí Advanced Right of withdrawal (extension to non-EU users) : in the US, at least at national level, businesses are generally not required to establish a return/refund policy for purchases made online, as in most cases this is implemented on a state-by-state basis. Under several state-laws, if no refund or return notice was made available to consumers before purchase, consumers are automatically granted extensive return/refund rights. Although e-commerce disclosures are still mostly enforced at state level, it is common practice to include this information in your terms and conditions document in many circumstances. With iubenda, you have the option to extend withdrawal rights to non-EU users. Please be informed that this may result in a considerable effort for your business, since you will be obliged to accept returns from potentially all over the world. How to find the related clause: Business model, payments and user rights ‚Üí User rights ‚Äï required by law or offered voluntarily by you ‚Üí Mandatory right of withdrawal for consumers in the EU ‚Üí ‚ÄúRight of withdrawal‚Äù section (required by law for European consumers) ‚Üí Applicability of withdrawal right ‚Üí You offer goods or services that the right of withdrawal applies to‚Üí Advanced: voluntary extensions of the withdrawal right ‚Üí Withdrawal target audience ‚Üí Who the withdrawal right applies to (you can extend it here contractually) However, we strongly recommend you to seek legal advice on the specific requirements of the market that you intend to target. EU law EU consumer law applies to contracts or other legal relationships between consumers (on one side) and professionals, businesses, companies on the other (B2C). It does not apply to B2B (e.g. a supermarket places an order with its fruit supplier) or C2C relationships (e.g. I sell my old bike over eBay). Among other things, under EU consumer law, consumers have an unconditional right to withdraw (‚Äúcooling off period‚Äù) of 14 days . This means that consumers may cancel or withdraw from distance contract (sales occurring online, over the phone, mail order) for any or no reason for 14 days after receiving the product (in the cases involving goods). It‚Äôs worth noting that 14 days is the statutory minimum ; in specific countries, national rules may extend this period, or single providers may extend is contractually. This right to withdraw does not apply in all situations. Some common exemptions are: Event and travel tickets & car rental reservations, but more in general any contract related to leisure activities, if the it provides for a specific date or period of performance;Sealed media items such as CDs which have been unsealed by the recipient;Digital content as soon as it‚Äôs downloaded by the consumer;Made to order or distinctly personalized items (eg. a tailored dress);Under some additional conditions, any contract about the delivery of a service, etc. Consumers located in the EU are also protected by a default legal 2 year guarantee on products purchased at no additional cost. Here again: 2-years is the statutory minimum ; in specific countries, national rules may extend this period, and it can be extended also contractually. These rules usually apply to any company selling to EU residents but may vary for international sellers on a case-by-case basis. It is worth noting, however , that in recent cases US courts have chosen to uphold the applicable EU law. So what‚Äôs the difference between returning a product on the grounds of withdrawal and returning it on the grounds of a guarantee? Applies for 14 days after receipt of the product or signing of the contract Applies for 24 months after receiving the product You don‚Äôt need to have any reason for exercising this right ‚Äî you can simply change your mind You may only return a product on guarantee grounds because it‚Äôs faulty or otherwise unsuitable for the purposes it has been sold and purchased for You may have to bear the costs of returning the product (but it must be specified) You may not be required to bear any cost (it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe seller‚Äôs fault‚Äù if the product is faulty) Applies with some exceptions (some of which are mentioned above) Always applies to products, never applies to services EU law also mandatorily requires that sellers inform consumers of the European Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform via direct link . The ODR, or ‚Äúonline dispute resolution‚Äù is a process that allows consumers based in the EU to easily file complaints (in regards to online sales) against companies also established in the EU.This means that ODR requirements can also apply to US companies that have any kind of physical presence in the EU. Note: UK businesses and UK consumers can no longer access the ODR platform after Brexit. Generally, privately owned websites (or similarly private social network profiles, blogs etc.) that merely have a private and personal purpose are not subject to additional regulations, however, various EU and national acts require online commercial operators to disclose certain information. In order to be deemed ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù, it is not necessary that you actually ‚Äúsell‚Äù anything ‚Äî a personal website may easily be considered commercial if, for instance, it generates considerable traffic an thereby creates relevant advertising revenue (e.g influencers) ‚Äî however, if you do ‚Äúsell‚Äù products or services, the information duties increase. If you sell directly to consumers (B2C), you‚Äôll face additional information duties including but not limited to those listed above , as well as linking to the EU online resolution platform for consumers, listing precise delivery times, making disclosures regarding prices and applicable taxes as outlined in Directive 83/2011/EU . Emails and Newsletters An e-mail address is considered personal data. Therefore, whenever dealing with e-mail addresses, privacy law is triggered. As we have mentioned already, under most legislations you‚Äôre required to inform extensively about the processing activities, their purposes and the rights of users. Generally, such legislations apply to any service targeting residents of the region, which effectively means that they may apply to your business whether it‚Äôs located in the region or not. This is even more relevant if you‚Äôre using a bought email list, as in such a case you may not know the recipient‚Äôs country of residence. For this reason, it‚Äôs always advisable that you approach your data processing activities with the strictest applicable regulations in mind . US law Under the FTC‚Äôs CAN-SPAM Act , you do not need consent prior to adding users located in the US to your mailing list or sending them commercial messages , however, it is mandatory that you provide users with a clear means of opting out of further contact. EU law Under EU law (namely the GDPR ) it is mandatory that you obtain the informed consent of the user before subscribing them to the service. Under EU regulations, acquiring consent can be considered a two-part process that includes informing the user and obtaining verifiable consent via an affirmative action. üí° You can read more about legal requirements regarding Newsletters and Email lists here . Children US law Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a United States federal law which was put in place to better protect the personal data and rights of children under 13 years of age. Under COPPA, operators of websites or online services that are either directed to children under 13, or which have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information from children under 13 must give notice to parents and get their verifiable consent before collecting, using, or disclosing such personal information and must keep secure the information they collect from children. A central requirement of this Act is having a COPPA-compliant privacy policy in place. You can read more about compliance in the sections below and learn more about COPPA here . EU law Under EU GDPR regulations , consent is one of the lawful bases for processing the data of children . If using this basis for processing the data of children under 13, you must get verifiable consent from a parent or guardian unless the service you offer is a preventative or counseling service. ? You can learn more about legal requirements regarding children here . Other Legal Considerations Setting Terms and protecting your business Though not always legally required, a Terms & Conditions (T&C) document (also known as a Terms of Service, End-user license agreement or a Terms of Use agreement ) is often necessary for the sake of practicality and safety. It allows you to regulate the contractual relationship between you and your users and is therefore essential for, among other things, setting the terms of use and protecting you from potential liabilities . The T&C document is essentially a legally binding agreement; therefore not only is it important to have one in place, but it‚Äôs also necessary to ensure that it meets legal requirements. Generally, standard contract terms will apply and under the most laws, contracts used by traders must be fair . This means that the document must be up-to-date with all applicable regulations, precise, visible and easily understandable so that users can both easily see it and agree to it . The ‚Äúagreeing action‚Äù should be done in an unambiguous way (e.g. clicking a checkbox with a visible link to the document before being able to create an account or use the service).While the full content may vary based on the particulars of your business, the Terms and Conditions should at least include the following: Identification of the business Description the service that your site/app providesInformation on risk allocation, liability, and disclaimers Warranty/Guarantee information (where applicable)The existence of a withdrawal right (if applicable) Safety information, including instructions for proper use (where applicable) Terms of delivery of product/service Rights of use (if applicable) Conditions of use / purchase (eg. age requirements, location-based restrictions) Refund policy/exchange/termination of service and related infoInfo related to methods of payment Any additional applicable terms ? You can learn more about Terms and Conditions here and how to create them . Third-party Requirements Third-party apps and services also need to follow the law. As organizations themselves, they too can be exposed to major reputational damage, fines, and sanctions if their legal obligations are not met. For this reason, it‚Äôs often mandatory that all partners and customers that use their services meet regulatory standards. Generally, they require that organizations that use their services have in place a compliant privacy policy (and cooky policy if cookies are in use) that discloses relevant details about the relationship and services rendered. Third-party apps and services also need to follow the law. For this reason, it‚Äôs often mandatory that all partners and customers that use their services meet regulatory standards One example is Google . In order to access certain services and tools (for example, AdSense, Google Analytics, Google Play store), Google requires that you have a comprehensive and up-to-date privacy policy in place. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the Google Analytics terms of use : ‚ÄúYou must post a Privacy Policy and that Privacy Policy must provide notice of Your use of cookies that are used to collect traffic data‚Äù, and ‚ÄúYou must not circumvent any privacy features (e.g, an opt-out) that are part of the Service.‚Äù Another example is that of Amazon . Here‚Äôs an excerpt of what they had to say: We extended the requirement to disclose our affiliate relationship to any means where you may be leveraging Associates‚Äô content. From time to time third party requirements can change in response to internal or regional regulations. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that your policies meet the latest requirements in order to avoid potential penalties or interruption of service. ? You can read more about Google ‚Äòs requirements here , and Amazon ‚Äòs here . Consequences of non-compliance The legal ramifications of non-compliance include: Fines Non-compliance with CalOPPA or COPPA may lead to government officials bringing suit or seeking civil penalties against you. In one example , the owners of the Imbee website were fined US$130,000 for COPPA violations of allowing children under 13 to register without parental consent. Similar fines can apply under other state and federal laws. Non-compliance with GDPR requirements can carry fines up to EUR 20 million (‚Ç¨20m) or 4% annual worldwide turnover (whichever is greater). Disciplinary measures Disciplinary measures may be implemented against you if you are found to be in violation of regulations. These measures may include but are not limited to official reprimands (for first-time violations) and periodic data protection audits. The GDPR gives users the explicit right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority if they feel that any processing of their personal data was done in violation of regulations. So for example, if a report is made to the authority about an instance of regulatory violation, the authority may choose to perform an audit of your data processing operations. If it‚Äôs found that some processing activity was done unlawfully, not only is a fine imposed, but you may be forbidden from making further use of the data subject of the inquiry. This means that if the violation use was in regards to email address collection, you risk being barred from using the entire associated email list. Non-compliance with consumer or competition law (acts of unfair competition) may also entail fines by the competent (mostly national) authorities. Liability damages It is a general principle of civil law, that you have to compensate any unjust damage you‚Äôve caused to someone else, in particular by violating a legal prescription. Among other acts, both the GDPR and the CalOPPA grant individual users the right to claim compensation for any damages resulting from a violation of their rights. The same reasoning would apply to any other applicable act or law, such as the EU‚Äôs consumer protection provisions. Remember that liability for damages applies in all relationships: also a business partner may be entitled to compensation if you violated a legal provision.For example, selling counterfeit goods via a partner platform like Amazon might result in the company taking legal action against you alongside the customers who purchased the counterfeit goods. Loss of services and contractual penalties Some third-party services ( including marketplaces and app stores ) may make compliance with specific regulations a part of their terms of use; violation of their terms may lead to service termination or potentially, permanent bans. Here is an example from Amazon Web Services Partner Network‚Äôs Terms and Conditions in regards to consent : For any Third-Party Data you provide to AWS, you represent and warrant that you have received all necessary consents for (a) you to share the Third Party Data with AWS and its Affiliates, and (b) AWS and its Affiliates to use the Third-Party Data to contact its subject(s) to market our goods and services and the Program. Criminal law Lastly, but perhaps most significantly, where certain conditions are met, it‚Äôs possible to face consequences via criminal law. If, for instance, you wilfully breach or ignore data protection provisions for commercial purposes (e.g. you sell peoples‚Äô personal data without telling them) you may face severe consequences. However, criminal law is largely a national issue: conditions and consequences must be checked on a case-by-case basis.
