Where personal data originating in Europe is (i) directly transferred to Mixpanel by its customers, (ii) transferred by Mixpanel on an intragroup basis between Mixpanel group entities, or (iii) transferred by Mixpanel to external (sub-)processors, Mixpanel enters into Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) with such parties. Additionally, Mixpanel has in place technical and organizational safeguards to comply with its legal obligations to protect personal data. In the future, Mixpanel may rely on alternative transfer tools, but only to the extent such transfer tools are recognized as providing appropriate safeguards necessary to meet the requirements of applicable data protections laws. Nonetheless, Mixpanel continues to participate in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for its collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.

Mixpanel complies with the Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
