This is an invitation to take part in the auction where the winner is allowed to display their ad to you. The information from the bid request is provided by our business partner in cooperation with a publisher.

Any use of the corresponding host application, where the umlaut insightCoreSDK is part of, is only allowed under the conditions as outlined below. Declaration of Consent to Data Processing By downloading and using a host application, which is enabled by the umlaut insightCoreSDK, you are consenting to the data processing as described in this Data Privacy Policy. With using the umlaut insightCoreSDK, we collect personal-related (pseudonymous) data. This is information that is not directly associated with the real-life identity of the user, for example, the type of internet connection, the measured velocity and location and measurements from connectivity tests, as well as system and usage parameters, and, provide those anonymized to our partners. In NO case do we collect content information such as messages or passwords. Data Privacy - What we stand for umlaut communications are aware that you consider a particularly safe handling of all your personal data as extremely important. Therefore, we guarantee that all your data is processed by us in accordance with the provisions of the relevant EU legislation, as implemented in Germany. What information is collected The umlaut insightCoreSDK collects personal-related (pseudonymous) data. This is information that is not directly associated with the real-life identity of the user (and which could not be used to identify them individually), for example, the type of internet connection, the measured velocity and location and measurements from connectivity tests, as well as system and usage parameters. At the latest after six months, the pseudonym is automatically replaced by a new random number. Information collected will at NO time be associated with names, email addresses or phone numbers of users. In NO case do we collect content information such as messages or passwords. In addition to the results of the tests run by the SDK other localization information and technical (system) parameters are obtained. Some technical parameters (such as wireless network information) are collected periodically, e.g. subject to GPS localization events. As far as IP-addresses are concerned, those will be masked on collection within the app, by removing the last three digits; therefore, a correlation to a single user is no longer possible. Specifically, the following data will be collected from the user's device and analyzed: Measurement results as executed by the umlaut insightCoreSDK (active measurements "Connection Test") Internet availability / success ratio Download time Latency ("ping") Measurement data collected through use of the device (passive measurements) Download speed Upload speed Dropped calls Wireless access technology Coverage / signal strength System and usage parameters User ID (pseudonymous random number) Wireless network information (e. g. network operator, Cell ID, signal strength, SSID) Device information (e. g. model, operating system) Location information (e. g. longitude / latitude) Usage information (e. g. transferred amount of data, call logs) App usage (e. g. of all installed apps, their usage time, duration, volume and location) Time information (e. g. time stamps of the measurements) Other system information (e. g. battery status, memory usage, connected devices) Release information (e. g. app build, data formats) The regular execution of the connection test and the collection of the passive measurements and system and usage information take place in the background. The connection test is regularly checking the availability of a data network connectivity to the internet and, thereby, it consumes less than 3MB in total per month. Purpose of Data Collection The data collected is used statistically, with the purposes of supporting the development and improvement of communication networks as well as usage-related analyses. Transfer of Information With acceptance of the Data Privacy Policy, you agree that the information described above, is stored and can be transferred anonymously to our partners. Personally identifiable data (like name, phone number or email address) are NOT collected and, therefore, can at no time be transferred to third parties.

A touchpoint means the view, click or order of a user or, in case of the use of our onsite measurement technology, a user's visit of a website on which our tracking technology is implemented. When an order is made by a user, our system reads this cookie to save these touchpoints connected to the order. We do not save any personal data in our system - all data is collected anonymously. For data/cookie storage we use the domain mediaintelligence.de. In detail, the following cookies are set through our technology: TRS: Unique, 24 digits Identifier (ID) to track partnerships and the customer journey of a user. This cookie is stored at the client-browser and identificates database records of touchpoints, which are stored in the dedicated databases of our customers. TRSCJ: Fallback cookie with elementary touchpoint data to track partnerships if the TRS cookie is not available or the database backend is not accessible.

This privacy statement describes the data E-Planning collects, and the ways it is used. E-Planning is a product of Caraytech S.A. and its affiliates. About E-planning E-Planning provides ad serving and web analytics services to media, advertisers, interactive agencies and ad networks. E-Planning is not itself an ad network, publisher or advertiser, but only provides the technology for them to operate. Personal Data Collection E-Planning does not collect any personal data from users. That is to say, E-Planning does not know your name, social security number, passport number, phone number or any other piece of information that can identify yourself. Cookies E-Planning uses cookies to configure frequency caps on campaigns, so that users do not view the same campaign over and over again. E-Planning also uses cookies to provide its clients reports on the number of distinct cookies that viewed each campaign or visited each web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard. A cookie is a file which is stored in your computer and is sent back to a web site whenever you visit it. Almost all web browsers have an option to disable cookies, in which case no cookies are received or sent. In the case of E-Planning, the only information stored in the cookie is a unique cookie ID, in an encrypted form. The cookie is set to expire 10 years after being set. If you do not wish to deactivate E-Planning cookies, you can easily opt out. Please remember that cookies must be enabled in your browser in order for the opt out function to work. Anonymous Data E-Planning collects anonymous information from users who access its clients' online campaigns or web sites. Such information may include: - Information about ad campaigns viewed - Information about web pages visited - Information about ads users clicked on The information stored allows us to provide our clients with reports about their campaigns and websites. These reports may include the number of distinct cookies or unique IP addresses that viewed each campaign or visited each website. Geolocation E-Planning uses geolocation technology to determine where users are located according to their IP address. The technology is so used to target campaigns as from users' country, region or city. For example, it allows the campaign of a restaurant in New York City to be displayed only for users of that city. E-Planning provides their clients geotargeting in 5 levels: country, region, city, telephone and zip code. The geolocation data base is not 100% accurate. Generally, the user's country may be correctly defined in more than 99% of cases, but, at the level of region or city, the accuracy level decreases almost to 90%, depending on the country. Geolocation is also used to provide our clients reports on traffic by country, region or city. Information Disclosure All information collected by E-Planning is solely for the purpose of providing its clients reports on campaign and website performance. This information is sometimes also used to optimize campaigns so that the highest performing campaigns get shown first. E-Planning may sometimes publish market reports providing average information across all its clients.
