By Oren Kaniel Jul 08, 2020 4 min read And why closing the feedback loop is crucial to enabling both Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in a recent statement that: “The App Store is a place where innovators and dreamers can bring their ideas to life, and users can find safe and trusted tools to make their lives better.” In order to deliver better user privacy, do users necessarily need to compromise on their experience, and the value they’re getting from their favorite apps? Must there really be a trade-off, or can the two coexist? Privacy is a fundamental human right, and a core value that both Apple and AppsFlyer share. Over the years, and most recently in its latest worldwide developer conference, Apple proved that there is a way to maintain both user privacy, and a superior user experience. Let’s review some of Apple’s recent privacy enhancements: Photos – When allowing an app to access your photos, you can now give permission to share only specific photos, instead of the entire photo library. Contacts – With iOS 14, you won’t have to share your entire contact list with apps, just the ones your app really needs access to in order to provide its promise. WiFi – Devices will not broadcast your MAC address (a non-resettable, persistent ID) to every WiFi hotspot around you. Camera & microphone – You will now have a clear indication when an app is using your camera and microphone. None of these privacy enhancements compromise the user’s experience, or the value they receive from their device or a given app. On the contrary, these measures increase users’ trust in the app store economy. Eventually, these actions are win-win-win for everyone – consumers, app developers, and the app store economy at-large. The IDFA/ATT change Following these important improvements, Apple introduced the App TrackingTransparency (ATT) framework, which will ultimately eliminate the IDFA . The IDFA is a great tool that enables the app store economy to flourish. On the other hand, it introduces privacy concerns, as it can be used in various ways, some of which could potentially harm user privacy. The IDFA is not inherently “ bad ” or “ good ” for users, and depends entirely on how it’s used. IDFA risks (the “bad”) IDFAs can be used to measure users across apps, build user profiles without proper consent or worse, attach GPS data to users across apps. In addition, they can be used for questionable practices like selling customer data and trading it for targeting or other uses. Apple is trying to get rid of these practices on their platform, which is without doubt a great move. IDFA benefits (the “good”) User experience In many cases, the IDFA is used to provide a stellar user experience and increased value to consumers. If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it. There is no doubt that measurement, or closing the feedback loop with attribution, is the key to improving user experience. Did the user find value in what was offered to them? Was the user experience good? To properly understand and measure the user’s journey, there is no need for any measuring across apps, no profiling, and surely no selling of user data. Developers measure users’ activity within the scope of their apps, and connect that to their owned media such as websites, social media platforms, emails, user referrals, and their own ads which users interacted with to install their app. Monetization and the app store economy Measurement allows app developers to monetize their work , so they can continue to innovate and create better products for their users. On the other hand, measurement makes sure that these developers present current and future users with relevant and appealing content, rather than spraying and praying. Moreover, IDFA introduced a major privacy improvement over its predecessor – the UDID, with the ability to reset and opt-out. Without the IDFA or an appropriate replacement, some in the ecosystem might be pushed to find loopholes, or use far more intrusive techniques. Get the latest marketing news and expert insights delivered to your inbox Great user privacy and great user experience can coexist Think about cars, for example; no one would think to suggest eliminating the use of cars altogether, even though they can be very dangerous. We believe that there are ways to increase users’ privacy and to improve their experience, creating a win-win-win for everyone. Eliminating IDFA without allowing proper attribution: Great privacy. Negative user experience In the last two years, we’ve been preparing for an IDFA-less ecosystem .We’ve been investing in multiple products and solutions, which along with our lifelong investment in privacy and security, make us very well prepared for the upcoming iOS14 updates. We are excited to share our immediate solutions with our customers and partners in the coming days and weeks, as well as to continue our discussions with Apple on long term ideas to maintain the highest levels of both user privacy and user experience. “In a challenging and unsettled time, the App Store provides enduring opportunities for entrepreneurship, health and well-being, education, and job creation, helping people adapt quickly to a changing world. We’re committed to doing even more to support and nurture the global App Store community – from one-developer shops in nearly every country to businesses that employ thousands of workers – as it continues to foster innovation, create jobs, and propel economic growth for the future.” – Tim Cook Share Oren Kaniel Follow Oren Kaniel Read this next 3 min read Open letter to regulators - for a better and safer digital experience 3 min read Saying NO is focusing.

Aggregated Advanced Privacy, and the future of privacy-centric measurement By Oren Kaniel Mar 22, 2021 3 min read Since the very beginning, privacy and security have been one of AppsFlyer’s core pillars, and our long-term commitment and investment in these areas pushed us to become experts on both. It helped us gain the trust of the biggest brands in the world by continuously prioritizing end-users’ privacy and experience. As a first-party, cloud-based software, used as a CRM, AppsFlyer enables brands to delight their end-users while preserving their privacy, and helps them comply with regulations and platform policies such as the updated iOS 14 guidelines. We’ve spent the last few years working on several innovative privacy-preserving solutions. Recently, we introduced a few of these groundbreaking technologies that are changing the industry’s measurement paradigm: From Incrementality measurement , to our SK360 suite of products , predictive analytics in SKAdNetwork (PredictSK), web to app campaigns , and Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP) framework. These solutions enable our customers to maintain exceptional user experience while also preserving the highest standards of privacy protection. In the last couple of months, we’ve been collaborating with the entire market to adapt to SKAdNetwork and introduced SK360, helping brands to maximize SKAdNetwork’s value and insights.However, the ecosystem adoption rates of Apple’s SKAdNetwork are still low, given its complexities, misconceptions , potential fraud risks , and the lack of clarity regarding the enforcement date. These risks and unknowns introduce significant challenges for all players in the ecosystem, but mostly for app developers. We are fully committed to resolving these challenges through our continued efforts to educate all affected parties, and by democratizing SKAdNetwork through collaboration across advertisers, ad-networks, and the entire ecosystem. With great power, comes great responsibility As a trusted market leader, we are aware of our immense responsibility. Both to our customers, by enabling them to comply with Apple’s policies and guidelines, and to the end-users, by making sure their privacy is preserved without impacting their experience. Privacy and security experts widely agree that aggregated data is preferable to user-level data when it comes to privacy and security risks. We have also previously discussed how aggregated measurement can improve both users’ experience and privacy , without building extensive user-level profiles, by simply closing the user feedback loop on an aggregated level as opposed to user-level. user-level attribution data will not be available by default for Apple devices operating on iOS 14.5 or above owned media ATT Similar to SKAdnetwork, AppsFlyer’s Aggregated Advanced Privacy aims to prevent cross-site measurement and the ability to uniquely identify a user or device. In fact, AppsFlyer’s Aggregated Advanced Privacy takes SKAdNetwork privacy levels as a minimum benchmark for its privacy-preserving thresholds. Get the latest marketing news and expert insights delivered to your inbox What to expect down the road in 2021 While deterministic user-level attribution is an accurate proxy to aggregated campaign performance, we have found that aggregated data provides more accurate measurement in a non-deterministic world. This is simply because the machine learning goal is to maximize the accuracy of the campaign’s aggregated performance, not the end-user attribution accuracy. In other words, while the goal of user-level attribution is to try and minimize false-positives and negatives, aggregated methods are not bound to user-level constraints, and therefore can provide better accuracy and much better user privacy. Our goal is to maximize campaign performance accuracy and granularity while providing a level of privacy that is equivalent or better to that defined by Apple and its SKAdnetwork framework. This is why we will continue to enhance and develop our Aggregated Advanced Privacy measurement technologies to improve privacy by making cross-site measurement technically impossible and improving on the SKAdNetwork privacy benchmark. As a trusted, unbiased and independent market leader, it is our responsibility to ensure we’re constantly doing the right thing for our customers, app developers, ecosystem and most importantly the end users.

It provides the ability to compute and analyze joint datasets, and derive business insights, without exposing individual user-level data. What are the key benefits of AppsFlyer Privacy Cloud? Collaborate with your partners in safe Data Clean Room environmentsAvoid attribution data blind spots with conversion data and insights that aren’t available from other attribution solutionsEnrich your 1st party data with attribution data and complement it with data in the Data Clean RoomGain full control of your data by configuring exactly what is shared within the Privacy Cloud, and defining data aggregation levels, granularity and moreBring your own business logic, or leverage AppsFlyer’s business logic such as Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP), lift measurement (incrementality), audience segmentation, mobile fraud, SKAN measurement, predictive analytics and more. Comply with all privacy regulations, policies, and guidelines How can meaningful insights be generated when data output is fully aggregated? Having campaign optimization and retargeting efforts rely on user-level data is no longer a viable solution. It compromises users’ privacy and creates significant data blind spots. Recent privacy changes in the industry have made it very clear: it’s time for a new way forward. Deep campaign insights and great marketing decisions can be made based on aggregated data, as long as the data is: AccurateCompleteGenerated from user-level data (that remains within the Data Clean Room) Is AppsFlyer Privacy Cloud fully compliant with Apple App Store and Google Play policies? Yes. The Privacy Cloud is preconfigured based on the privacy guidelines set by the various platforms. These preconfigured settings are constantly being updated as new privacy guidelines are being rolled out by Apple, Google (and/or any other platforms and partners) to make sure you are always aligned with their latest requirements. Are there cases in which user-level data will be shared outside of the Privacy Cloud? If user-level data sharing is allowed (based on the specific partner and platform privacy guidelines, privacy laws applicable to you and user consent) and that’s what you require, then yes, user-level data can still be shared.
