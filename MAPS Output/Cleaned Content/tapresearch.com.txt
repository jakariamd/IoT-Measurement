Definitions “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household; provided, however, that as applicable “Personal Information” shall have the definition given to “Personal Data” under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). “Separate and Independent Controller” means each party is a distinct Controller with regard to Personal Information and determines its independent legal basis for the processing of Personal Information received. Information Collected and Method of Collection Information (including Personal Information) collected is relevant for the purpose for which it is to be used and, to the extent necessary, TapResearch takes reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

Response Metadata may include: Device Information/Specifications: Technical information about your computer or device (e.g., type of device, web browser or operating system, IP address, etc.).

Cookies: We may use cookies to keep track of some types of information while you are using the Services. Cookies are very small files placed on your computer, which allow us to perform analytics, such as counting the number of users of the Services and distinguishing repeat users from new or unique users. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze usage of the Services more accurately, such as user preferences or trends (e.g., the Services may set a cookie on your browser allowing you to bypass engagement with a survey due to your previous completion of a survey). We rely on cookies for the proper operation of the Services; therefore, if your browser is set to reject cookies, the Services may not function properly. If you refuse cookies from the Services, you assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality or benefits with respect to the Services.
