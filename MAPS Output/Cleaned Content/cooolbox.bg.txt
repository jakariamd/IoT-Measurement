Coolbox and personal data security.Appropriate organizational measures for personal data protection Coolbox, as a personal data controller, will apply appropriate and effective organizational and technical measures to protect personal data in order to comply with the Regulation and the PDPA, while at the same time the company bears the burden of proving that the processing of the personal data of the subjects is in compliance with the Regulation and the PDPA, as follows: implementation and effectiveness of the introduced organizational and technical measures. Coolbox sets out the appropriate organizational and technical measures for the protection of personal data, both at the stage of defining the processing objectives, the types of processing and the means of processing, as well as the actual processing of the data, taking into account the specifics of their activity; personal data that are necessary at least to be collected and processed in the course of the activity and achievement of the identified processing objectives; state of the technics; the cost of introducing new technologies; the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of personal data; the risk of breaching the protection of personal data and its impact on the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Coolbox shall implement technical and organizational measures for ensuring that, by default, only those personal data which are necessary for any specifically established purpose of the processing are being processed. This obligation relates to the volume of personal data collected, the level of processing, the period of storage and their accessibility. In other words, such measures will ensure that by default, without the intervention of an individual, personal data processed by Coolbox will not be available to an unlimited number of persons. When imposed by the Regulation or by the applicable Bulgarian legislation or by the Supervisory Body in the form of the Personal Data Protection Commission, Coolbox determines appropriate organizational and technical protection measures after conducting a Risk Assessment of the impact of a treatment on the protection of personal data. Impact assessment is a process for determining the level of risk of the impact of a data processing on the rights and freedoms of a particular individual or group of physical persons - the subject and the data processed, depending on the specific data, treatment objectives and the number of physical persons in the event of a breach of personal data protection. The risk to the rights and freedoms of physical persons, of different probability and severity, may arise from the processing of personal data which could lead to a breach of the protection of personal data; or when data subjects may be deprived of their rights and freedoms or deprived of the right to exercise control over their personal data; when processing sensitive personal data; when assessing personal aspects, in particular analysing or forecasting aspects relating to the economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements in space, with the purpose of creating or using personal profiles; when processing personal data of vulnerable persons, especially children; or when processing involves a large volume of personal data and affects a large number of data subjects. The results of the assessment should be taken into account by Coolbox, when determining the appropriate measures to prove that the processing of personal data complies with the requirements of the Regulation. When a data protection impact assessment indicates that processing operations lead to a high risk which Coolbox cannot limit by appropriate organizational and technical measures in terms of available technologies and application costs, consultation with the supervisory body in the face of CPDP should be performed. 10.
