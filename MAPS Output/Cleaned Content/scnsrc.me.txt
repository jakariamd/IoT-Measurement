PreDB About FAQ IRC Contact Q: Why does the Torrent link link to LazyPirate and/or show that there are no torrents? A: We link to LazyPirate as they are partners of our website, and also because it is one of the best indexers around. If the results say there are no torrents, it usually means that there aren’t any torrents available to download the link. Q: The CAPTCHA image doesn’t display (or the WAV file doesn’t work), and now I can’t comment! A: Firstly, make sure your ad blockers are turned off, and you don’t have any type of no script add-on in your browser. If still nothing, make sure you have JavaScript turned on, and you are able to view Java content. If all that fails, drop us a line via email describing your setup and we will endeavor to get back to you with a solution. Q: Why do you guys rock so much? A: Unknown, we are just doing it for the epic lulz! xD Categories Games (3,946) ISO (2,399) Movies (28,387) BDRip (3,733) BluRay (9,267) DVDRip (5,972) HD (4,270) UHD (1,388) Music (4,020) P2P (7,500) TV (91,885) UHD (819) Filters Theme Switcher Friends Watch Movies DDLValley
