This is your chance to try Malwarebytes Privacy for seven days, completely free on up to five devices. You get all the same features as the paid version with no data caps or geolocation restrictions. You can see what it's like to connect and browse privately. At the end of your trial, you will have the option to buy Malwarebytes Privacy, either through the app or on our website. What is a VPN and why do I need it? A VPN, or virtual private network, is a secure connection between people and devices over the Internet. A VPN makes going online safer and more private by stopping people from seeing who you are, where you are, or what you’re looking at. For more information visit: What is a VPN . Does VPN work on WiFi and ethernet? Yes. An Internet VPN, such as Malwarebytes Privacy, offers a tunnel between you and the Internet, allowing you to browse the web securely and privately, no matter if you’re using a public WiFi network at a cafe or plugged in to the ethernet at a hotel. Where are the servers located? We currently have 500+ servers in over 40+ countries and counting. In the US, alone, we have servers across 10+ cities to make it easy to find a fast server for your needs. Is there support for any other OS besides Windows? Malwarebytes Privacy is available on Windows, MacOS, iOS, and Android. Does Malwarebytes Privacy work on my mobile device? Malwarebytes Privacy is available for iOS 13 (or higher) and Android 7 (or higher). Can I purchase this for fewer than five devices? Malwarebytes Privacy is available for purchase on one, three, or five devices. We encourage sharing with your family and loved ones. Can this be purchased in my country? Malwarebytes Privacy is available in 10 languages: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil), and Portuguese (Portugal). You can purchase it for use in most countries where VPNs are not blocked by state-run firewalls. How does Privacy differ from Malwarebytes Premium? Malwarebytes Premium replaces antivirus and provides protection on your device against viruses, ransomware, and other forms of malware. It can also clean an already infected device. However, it cannot secure your connection on public WiFi or protect your privacy when you are on a website that is actively collecting your personal data, IP address, and geolocation. This is where Malwarebytes Privacy comes in—to protect your connection and act as a digital middleperson so that hackers and snoops cannot invade your privacy. I'm already a Malwarebytes Premium subscriber. How can I add Malwarebytes Privacy to my current subscription? What would be the cost? You can add Malwarebytes Privacy and your subscription length won’t extend. You’ll simply pay the difference for the remaining time on your subscription.

Software Collection – information collected when using our security software User-Agent String Each API communication coming from any of our client software identifies itself with a string that includes information about the software itself: The program and build which is sending the requestThe current license state (as identified by the product)The version of the software as well as any subcomponents (currently, databases) that it uses Why? So we can manage your Malwarebytes product and ensure that it is up to date. GeoIP Data When we collect data from our client systems, we do not store IP address from which the request originates. . However, we do use it to gather geographic information on the system calling in: A location item indicating the continent, country, city, and approximate latitude/ longitude of the user based on your IP addressThe type of connection (dialup/broadband/satellite/mobile)The ISP through which the connection is made The organization to which the IP address is licensed, if any Why? So our malware intelligence team can track malware and potentially unwanted program ("PUP") outbreaks and patterns. Functional Data We collect data that is necessary for the functionality of the software or for our performance of providing the software to you. For example, we may need to collect system processes and behaviors in order to perform system rollback and recovery operations. Why?
