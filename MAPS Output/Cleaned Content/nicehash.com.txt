Losing access to your email, registered at NiceHash Platform, may also mean losing access to your NiceHash Account. You may not be able to use the NiceHash Platform or Mining Services, execute withdrawals and other security sensitive operations until you regain access to your email address, registered at NiceHash Platform. If you wish to change the email address linked to your NiceHash Account, we may ask you to complete a KYC procedure for security purposes. This step serves solely for the purpose of identification in the process of regaining access to your NiceHash Account. Once the NiceHash Account is created a NiceWallet is automatically created for the NiceHash Account when the request for the first deposit to the NiceWallet is made by the user. Account holder’s NiceWallet is generated by the NiceWallet provider. Account holder is strongly suggested to enhance the security of his NiceHash Account by adding an additional security step of Two-factor authentication (hereinafter “2FA”) when logging into his account, withdrawing funds from his NiceWallet or placing a new order. Account holder can enable this security feature in the settings of his NiceHash Account. In the event of losing or changing 2FA code, we may ask the Account holder to complete a KYC procedure for security reasons. This step serves solely for the purpose of identification in the process of reactivating Account holders 2FA. In order to use certain functionalities of the NiceHash Platform, such as paying for the acquired hashing power, users must deposit funds to the NiceWallet, as the payments for the hashing power could be made only through NiceWallet. Hashing power providers have two options to get paid for the provided hashing power: (i) by using NiceWallet to receive the payments or (ii) by providing other Bitcoin address where the payments shall be received to. Hashing power providers provide their Bitcoin address to NiceHash by providing such details via Account holder’s profile settings or in a form of a stratum username while connecting to NiceHash stratum servers. Account holder may load funds on his NiceWallet from his Secondary account. Account holder may be charged fees by the Secondary account provider or by the blockchain network for such transaction. NiceHash is not responsible for any fees charged by Secondary account providers or by the blockchain network or for the management and security of the Secondary accounts. Account holder is solely responsible for his use of Secondary accounts and Account holder agrees to comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any Secondary accounts. The timing associated with a load transaction will depend in part upon the performance of Secondary accounts providers, the performance of blockchain network and performance of the NiceWallet provider. NiceHash makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to load funds on to NiceWallet. NiceWallet shall not be used by Account holders to keep, save and hold funds for longer period and also not for executing other transactions which are not related to the transactions regarding the NiceHash Platform. The NiceWallet shall be used exclusively and only for current and ongoing transactions regarding the NiceHash Platform. Account holders shall promptly withdraw any funds kept on the NiceWallet that will not be used and are not intended for the reasons described earlier. Commission fees may be charged by the NiceWallet provider, by the blockchain network or by NiceHash for any NiceWallet transactions. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the commission fees for NiceWallet transactions which are applicable at the time of the transaction. NiceHash reserves the right to change these commission fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. You have the right to use the NiceHash Account only in compliance with these Terms and other commercial terms and principles published on the NiceHash Platform.In particular, you must observe all regulations aimed at ensuring the security of funds and financial transactions. Provided that the balance of funds in your NiceWallet is greater than any minimum balance requirements needed to satisfy any of your open orders, you may withdraw from your NiceWallet any amount of funds, up to the total amount of funds in your NiceWallet in excess of such minimum balance requirements, to Secondary Account, less any applicable withdrawal fees charged by NiceHash or by the blockchain network for such transaction. Withdrawals are not processed instantly and may be grouped with other withdrawal requests. Some withdrawals may require additional verification information which you will have to provide in order to process the withdrawal. It may take up to 24 hours before withdrawal is fully processed and distributed to the Blockchain network. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform for more information about the withdrawal fees and withdrawal processing. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. You have the right to close the NiceHash Account. In case you have funds on your NiceWallet you should withdraw funds from your account prior to requesting NiceHash Account closure. After we receive your NiceHash Account closure request we will deactivate your NiceHash Account. You can read more about closing the NiceHash Account in our Privacy Policy. Your NiceHash Account may be deactivated due to your inactivity. Your NiceHash account may be locked and a mandatory KYC procedure is applied for security reasons, if it has been more than 6 months since your last login.

Users may access the product via NiceHash Website, NiceHash Mobile App or through the NiceHash API, while guests can access the product only via NiceHash Website. NiceHash provides users/guests with packages containing information about the availability, the mining algorithm for a specific Digital Asset, the price of the package, the probability of validating a single block and the amount of the Blockchain reward for a validated block. Users/guests may purchase the packages only using Bitcoin and have to have sufficient funds on their NiceWallet before the purchase. Before completing the purchase of the package users/guests have to specify whether they wish to receive the potential Blockchain reward to their NiceWallet or to an external Digital Asset wallet. A KYC procedure and enabled 2FA security feature are mandatory when choosing an external Digital Asset wallet. Once the package has been successfully selected and the Hashing Power Order placed, NiceHash provides the user/guest with the information about the exact start of the Hashing Power Order, its lifetime, approximate remaining time, the price of the Hashing power and the amount of committed Hashing power on the Hashing Power Order. The purchased Hashing power is directed to the NiceHash EasyMining Pool according to the selected package. Users are able to stop the placed Hashing Power Order at any time until its complete fulfillment. Please note that users or guests using NiceHash EasyMining service purchase the Hashing power from Hashing Power Providers who get paid for the provided Hashing power by shares based on the principle “pay-per-valid-share”. In case the order is stopped, the user of NiceHash EasyMining is not entitled to the remuneration for the shares already committed to the pool according to the placed order. By purchasing the package and placing the Hashing Power Order users/guests participate in mining (commiting shares to the NiceHash Mining Pool) according to the selected package.In case the share committed by the user/guest using NiceHash EasyMining validates an individual block on the Blockchain of the selected Digital Asset, the user/guest shall be entitled to the Blockchain Reward as determined by each individual Blockchain, reduced by the applicable NiceHash service fee (NiceHash EasyMining Pool fee). In addition to that, the processing fee for Hashing Power Order applies. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform Website for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees. All orders submitted prior the fee change but not necessarily completed prior the fee change will be charged according to the fees applicable at the time of the submission of the order. PLEASE NOTE THAT MINING DIGITAL ASSETS IN GENERAL IS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY IN WHICH MINERS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER TO VALIDATE A BLOCK ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. NICEHASH DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL VALIDATE A BLOCK AND EARN THE REWARD WITH THE PURCHASED PACKAGE. EASYMINING IS A HIGHLY SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY AND SHOULD BE EXERCISED WITH GREAT CAUTION WITH ADEQUATE TECHNICAL RESOURCES AND KNOWLEDGE. If one of the purchased shares validates a block through the NiceHash EasyMining Pool, the user/guest who committed that particular share is entitled to the Blockchain Reward. Please note that Blockchain Rewards are determined by each Blockchain and are outside of NiceHash’s control. Before any reward can be claimed and Digital Assets transferred, the Blockchain needs to confirm the Coinbase transaction according to the Blockchain protocol (block maturation time) which is also out of NiceHash’s control. Block maturation time is part of the Blockchain protocol and prevents a doublespend scenario, because there is a chance that the block will get “orphaned” (or “stale”). The user/guest may not be eligible to claim the reward should such a scenario occur. Please note that a successfully completed KYC procedure is mandatory in order to claim the Blockchain Reward. NICEHASH TEAMMINING NiceHash TeamMining is a service available for NiceHash users/guests that allows them to purchase Hashing power jointly with other users/guests in order to enhance the probability to find a block through mining operations on the NiceHash EasyMining Pool.

Probability is calculated considering the amount of so far committed Package Shares. Multiple users/guests may jointly place a Hashing Power Order through the NiceHash TeamMining service by joining an opened NiceHash TeamMining Package (mining lobby) up until the maximum value of Package Shares has been reached (the indicated maximum amount of the Hashing Power Order has been reached) or until the indicated time on the NiceHash TeamMining Package / mining lobby has elapsed.

Each share is the minimum nominal contribution of the individual user/guest to the joint Hashing Power Order, expressed in BTC. Users/guests may choose to buy at least one Package Share and up to the total number of Package Shares, available in the selected TeamMining Package in order to participate. Users/guests may buy NiceHash TeamMining Package Shares only using Bitcoin and have to have sufficient funds on their NiceWallet before the purchase.
