When it comes to finding the best ad blocker or privacy enhancer for your browser, you’ll find that there are a few options available to install. One of the most well-known is Privacy Badger, a free tracking blocker that enhances your privacy online. We take a look at Privacy Badger, which is an alternative to Ghostery Anti-Tracking, to give you a better idea of how they compare against each other. What is Privacy Badger? Privacy Badger is a free privacy extension that can be installed on multiple browsers and was created by a non-profit organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 2014. It can be used to block trackers, and other privacy invading elements that you may not be aware of whilst browsing the web. What platforms does Privacy Badger work on? Privacy Badger can be installed on the following browsers: FirefoxChromeFirefox on AndroidMicrosoft EdgeOpera Whilst you can use Privacy Badger in Chrome and other browsers, it is not currently available for Safari, so it is not a suitable option if you want a free tracker blocker for iOS products. How does Privacy Badger compare to Ghostery User interface The user interface (UI) is important as the easier it is to use, the more you will be able to benefit from the extension. Privacy Badger encourages people to only interact with the UI if you notice an issue. So, it doesn’t expect the user to spend much time in the mechanics of the extension and this is reflected in the UI. In comparison, Ghostery actively encourages people to engage with the UI and learn about trackers and the simple, professional design enables you to do that. All the information you need is presented in a clean format without any unnecessary distractions, so you can navigate and find what you need quickly and easily. With Ghostery, it’s a simple case of ticking boxes of the options you want to activate and if you aren’t sure what they do, simply click on the small ‘i’ icon to get a helpful explanation. Control options Both extensions give you a lot of control over the type of elements you can block online. However, Privacy Badger is the less educational of the two, providing fewer insights into who is tracking you. If you want more information about who is spying on you online, then Ghostery is the way to go. You’ll get more insight about the type of companies following you, so you are more aware of what to look out for whilst browsing. Some people may not care to learn about the trackers and will be happy to let the extension get on with its job. Ghostery can do that too, but with the option to learn more about each tracker you may even be able to take advantage of some of their individual benefits if you choose not to block them. Privacy As a non-profit organisation, you have some assurances that Privacy Badger will not be collecting your data for profit. The extension is open source , which means contributors from all over the world can offer code updates to improve its functionality. Ghostery is also open source and benefits from an active community of developers who are involved in improving the privacy of everyone that uses the extension. There is also an important distinction to make between the two extensions. Privacy Badger is not an ad-blocker, although it may still block some of them once activated. Instead, it is a third-party tracker blocker that prevents unwanted sources from following you around the web. On the other hand, Ghostery also blocks ads and trackers, giving you all-round protection online, placing strong security around your personal information. Speed When it comes to improving page-loading speed, Ghostery being an ad blocker leads the way. It helps to declutter web pages that are overloaded with too many resources, speeding up page loading and making your internet bandwidth and battery work more efficiently for you. Privacy Badger can offer some advantages in terms of page loading speed. Being limited to blocking only trackers, it doesn’t have the same range of capabilities as Ghostery in this area. What are the pros and cons of Privacy Badger? Pros Automatically blocks third-party trackersAvailable for multiple browsers including Firefox on AndroidEasy to set up and useAutomatically detects trackers and does not use curated blocklists Cons Is not designed to block adverts and cookie consent dialoguesNot available for Safari (iPhones/Apple Mac etc.)Not as user friendly as other similar extensions What are the pros and cons of Ghostery?Pros Blocks adverts, third-party trackers and cookie popupsCan be installed on multiple browsers including SafariOffers private search and detailed tracker analysisAutomatically detects trackers and does not rely only on curated blocklists Cons In-depth tracker analysis may not be suitable for everyone Not available on Chrome on Android as Chrome does not allow extensions – but is downloadable for Firefox on Android Blocks more aggressively so there may be a higher chance of breaking a page Summary There are similarities between Privacy Badger and Ghostery in some areas, although they do specialize in their own areas. For example, Privacy Badger focuses on third-party blockers and performs that task very well, whilst Ghostery excels at blocking ads, trackers and popups. So, if you are looking for an alternative to Ghostery, we recommend using Privacy Badger paired with uBlock Origin , which will give you the same level of strong protection provided by Ghostery alone. FAQ Is Ghostery better than Privacy Badger? Ghostery serves more needs than Privacy Badger. While Privacy Badger blocks trackers and some ads, Ghostery is a full fledged adblocker and anti-tracking tool in one. It blocks ads, trackers and cookie consent popups, choosing optimal privacy settings, so you can enjoy peace of mind while browsing the web. Does Ghostery hide your IP? Ghostery does not hide your IP. To hide your IP the best complement to Ghostery is a VPN service. Suggested reading: Ghostery and VPNs - The Privacy Duo Explained. Is Ghostery safe?

General information This section of the data privacy statement contains information on the scope of validity, the person responsible for data processing (controller), the data protection officer and data security. It also begins with a list of definitions of important terms used in the data privacy statement. I. Definition of main terms Browser: Computer program used to display websites (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) Cookies: Text files placed on the user’s computer by the web server by means of the browser which is used. The stored cookie information may contain both an identifier (cookie ID) for recognition purposes and content data, such as login status or information about websites visited. The browser sends the cookie information back to the web server with each new request upon subsequent repeat visits to these sites. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. Cookies can be managed using the browser functions (usually under “Options” or “Settings”). The storage of cookies may be disabled in this way or it may be made dependent on the user’s approval in any given case or otherwise restricted. Cookies may also be deleted at any time. Third countries: Countries outside of the European Union (EU) GDPR: Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), available here Personal data: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Profiling: Any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. Services: Our offers to which this data privacy statement applies (cf. Scope of validity). Tracking: The collection of data and their evaluation regarding the behaviour of visitors in response to our services. Tracking technologies: Actions can be tracked either via the activity records stored on our web servers (log files) or by collecting data from end devices via pixels cookies or similar tracking technologies. Processing: Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. Pixel: Pixels are also called tracking pixels, web beacons or web bugs. These are small, invisible graphics in HTML emails or on websites. When a document is opened, this small image is downloaded from a server on the Internet and the download is registered there. This allows the operator of the server to see if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited.This function is usually carried out by calling up a small program (JavaScript). Certain types of information can be detected on your computer system in this way and shared, such as the content of cookies , the time and date of the visit, and a description of the page on which the tracking pixel is located. II. Scope of validity This data privacy statement applies to the following services: Our online offering “Ghostery” (website), mainly available at https://www.ghostery.com Whenever reference is made to this Privacy Policy from one of our further offers (e.g. websites, subdomains, mobile applications, web services or links to third-party sites), regardless of the way in which it is accessed or used. All of these offers are also collectively referred to as “ services ”. III. Controller The following party is responsible for the processing of data in relation to the services, i.e. the role of controller which involves determining the purposes and means of processing personal data: IV.

In cases where the provision of data is required, the consequence of not providing data will be that the service in question cannot be provided. Otherwise, failure to provide data may result in our inability to provide our services in the same form and quality. b) Consent In various cases, you may also grant us your consent to the further processing of data (or some of the data, where applicable) in connection with the operations listed below. In this case, we will inform you separately in connection with the submission of the respective declaration of consent about all the procedures and the scope of the consent and concerning the purposes which we pursue in these processing operations. The processing operations based on your consent are therefore not listed again here (Art. 13 (4) GDPR). c) Transfer of personal data to third countries When we send data to third countries, i.e. countries outside of the European Union, the data are then transmitted strictly in compliance with the statutory conditions of admissibility. If the transmission of the data to a third country does not serve the purpose of fulfilling our contract with you, if we do not have your consent, if the transmission is not required for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims, and if no other exemption applies under Art. 49 GDPR, we will only transmit your data to a third country if in possession of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR or appropriate guarantees under Art. 46 GDPR. In order to ensure an adequate level of data protection, we provide appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 (2) c) GDPR by the conclusion of EU standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with the receiving body. Copies of the standard EU data protection clauses are available on the website of the European Commission here. d) Hosting at external service providers Our data processing work is carried out to a large extent with the involvement of hosting service providers who provide us with storage space and processing capacities at their data centres and who also process personal data on our behalf according to our instructions.

X. Country detection For providing localized content and reporting telemetry, the Ghostery website needs to know the approximate region from which the browser connects to the internet. Ghostery requires only very basic information on the region, namely the country. No other detailed information like state or city are ever inferred. To detect it, Ghostery uses two methods: 1. The mapping of IP address to a country; 2. Content Delivery Network’s edge location which is the country of the closest data center. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party. XI. Use of Cookies For the purpose of operating the website, we use absolutely necessary (“technically necessary”) cookies. We would like to inform you about the cookies used in the following: Name of the Cookie Purpose Storage period user_id Creating a User ID 7 days refresh_token Authentication 7 days access_token Authentication 1 hour __stripe_sid Processing payment transactions 30 minutes __stripe_mid Processing payment transactions 0 minutes ctry Country detection Session C. Details of data processing within Ghostery Browser Extensions A fundamental piece of technology that started Ghostery, the Browser Extension drives our mission to improve web privacy. It’s a powerful add-on that gives users the choice to block ads and trackers, and to improve the browsing experience by hiding annoyances such as cookie notices and distracting banners or popups. Ghostery can either notify users about trackers it finds or silently block them in the background, so you don’t have to worry about them. By design, the Ghostery Browser Extension ensures that all data it processes has strictly non-personal character. Because tracking protection and ad blocking requires us to understand the browser network traffic, we detach and discard any personal identifiers from the shared information that is required to provide the extension features. Information on the processing of your personal data within the Ghostery Browser Extension for the purposes of Creating a User Account, Paid-for-services, Support as well as for Submitting a tracker can already be found in section B. of this Privacy Policy. I. Telemetry To get basic insights on the health of the Ghostery Browser Extension a very simple information snippet about the extension installation is sent to Ghostery daily. This information is strictly non-personal, it covers a general overview of the extension settings, like whenever or not tracking protection or ad blocking are enabled. Furthermore, basic information about the browser Ghostery runs in is collected as well as the operating system, language and country from which it is being used. Extra telemetry is sent if users opt-in to additional telemetry, helping Ghostery understand which product features are commonly used and facilitating future development and improvements of the Ghostery Browser Extension. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party. II. Customer Messaging Platform For the purpose of reaching out to certain groups of users, the Customer Messaging Platform distributes marketing messaging to all Ghostery Browser Extension users. The individual Ghostery Browser Extension sends strictly non-personal information to the Ghostery Customer Messaging Platform servers. This information is very basic like browser type, extension version or language of the browser. In this messaging model, Ghostery does not know which exact users get the particular message and is unable to target individuals. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party. III. Block list updates Multiple Ghostery Browser Extension features rely on regular data updates for best coverage. E.g. the ad blocker and anti-tracking features integrated in the Ghostery Browser Extension get daily updates. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party. IV. WhoTracks.Me Ghostery operates to track the trackers. All users accepting the Ghostery Privacy Policy report information on online tracking and non-private search engines to whotracks.me .This way Ghostery creates a feedback loop from the user community observing the behaviour of online trackers and stopping the tracking and fingerprinting as it happens. The reported information is strictly related to the observed parties and never includes information about the observer (the user). All communication is encrypted end-to-end. In addition a protocol is used to ensure anonymity on a network layer, by making every individual message look like as coming from a different browser. No two messages can be linked. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No personal data is ever shared with a third party. V. Phishing and Malware protection One of Ghostery features is Phishing and Malware protection which requires Ghostery Browser Extension to test every visited url against a large list of potentially harmful domains. As this domain list is extremely large and frequently changed, shipping it with the extension is not feasible. To be able to provide this type of protection and ensure users’ privacy, the Ghostery Browser Extension never shares a full url with the Ghostery backend but sends a checksum (technically half of it) only, being sufficient for checking if the domain is on the block list but insufficient to tell which page it exactly is. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party. VI. User Account Session refresh For providing premium features the Ghostery Browser Extension relies on the ghostery.com login session. Once logged in via extension or Ghostery website, the user session will automatically refresh as long as the browser is open. The session will be destroyed once a user logs out from the website or the Ghostery Browser Extension. a) Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of stor age Data category: Access data Account Data Purpose: Insofar as we process personal data in this context, this processing is carried out exclusively for the purpose of user convenience. Legal basis: Your personal data is processed on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest is to provide you with the most user-friendly service possible. Period of storage: Your personal data will be deleted as soon as their further processing is no longer necessary for the respective purpose and legal retention periods do not prevent deletion. This is regularly the case upon the deletion of your account. b) Recipients of the personal data Recipient category: In the context of a User Account Session refresh, we don’t transmit any personal data to third parties. Data concerned: All data listed under (a) in this section Legal Basis: Art. 28 GDPR VII. Country detection For providing features like country-based ad blocking and reporting telemetry, the Ghostery Browser Extension needs to know the approximate region from which the browser connects to the internet. Ghostery requires only very basic information on the region, namely the country. No other detailed information like state or city are ever inferred. To detect it, Ghostery uses two methods: 1. The mapping of IP address to a country; 2. Content Delivery Network’s edge location which is the country of the closest data center by which the Ghostery Browser Extension is able to reach. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party. VIII. Setting Synchronization Logged in Ghostery premium users have their settings automatically synchronised across all browsers with Ghostery Browser Extension installed. Those settings are stored on the Ghostery servers. The information about the settings synchronisation is never logged or processed by Ghostery in other way but to provide the Synchronisation feature. a) Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of storage Data category: Access data ; Account data Purpose: The processing is carried out for the purpose of synchronizing your settings within the browsers you are using. Processing for other purposes is excluded. Legal basis: The processing of your personal data is based on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest is based on the provision of a more user-friendly service. Period of storage: Your personal data will be deleted as soon as their further processing is no longer necessary for the respective purpose and legal retention periods do not prevent deletion.This is regularly the case upon the deletion of your account. b) Recipients of the personal data Recipient category: In the context of the setting synchronisation, we don’t transmit any personal data to third parties. Data concerned: All data listed under (a) in this section Legal Basis: Art. 28 GDPR IX. A/B tests Ghostery’s A/B tests functionality is available to all users and will periodically download a list of active A/B test setups. The individual Ghostery Browser Extension sends strictly non-personal information to Ghostery A/B test servers. This information is very basic like browser type, country, extension version or operating system. Ghostery never gets any reports on which exact users are participating in a specific A/B test and A/B test information is never connected to the Ghostery account. Ghostery users can opt out of this functionality in Ghostery control panel. For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in VI. Accessing our services .

We will indicate this to you in an appropriate manner. (2) If there is a concrete indication that a user is breaching or has breached Sections 5 or 6 of these GTCs, we have the right to respond as follows, in consideration of and weighing the interests of the corresponding users: We will always take into consideration the severity of the breach and the degree of user’s culpability when choosing a sanction for a breach of the GTCs.We will warn the user in advance if this is appropriate as the mildest measure in an individual case.Furthermore, if the suspicion that a user has breached Section 5 or 6 is confirmed, we can block the user’s access completely or partially and for a certain time or even permanently delete it. A user account is deleted only in case of an intentional breach of these GTCs, committed repeatedly or with the intent of causing damage or for personal enrichment. If a user is blocked by us or their user account is deleted, this block is aimed at this user as a person and not just at the relevant username, e-mail address or corresponding user account they used. (3) If statutory requirements are met, we always have the right to extraordinary cancellation of the contract with the user with immediate effect. Additional and further claims, in particular claims for damages, remain unaffected. 8. Availability of our Products and Services (1) The gratuitous use of our products and services is offered to users subject to availability. We make an effort to ensure that the user is provided gratuitous services without disruptions. Use may be limited or temporarily interrupted as a result of maintenance work, further development or other disruptions. If this is the case, it does not give rise to claims for damages against us.(2) In the case of fee-based offers of our products and services, we fulfill our contract with you in accordance with the concrete product specifications. We try to ensure the highest possible availability, but our products and services are mainly software services that undergo constant changes. Use may be limited or temporarily interrupted as a result of maintenance work, further development or other disruptions. If this is the case, it does not give rise to claims for damages against us. Statutory warranty claims under German law and in case of an express assumption of a guarantee by us remain unaffected. In no case are we liable for disruptions of your Internet connection or disruptions on the part of your provider or disruptions due to force majeure. (3) Furthermore, we have the right to change or discontinue the offered free services and performance at any time at our own discretion without notice. Fee-based services can be discontinued any time after the expiry of the agreed period of performance. 9. Our Liability 9.1 Our products and services protect your privacy in the scope indicated in the corresponding specifications. For this purpose, we implement the measures described in the specifications, the privacy policy and these GTCs. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties are unable to bypass these measures and your information is always absolutely protected from access by third parties. 9.2 Under contracts for fee-based services, we are only liable, subject to statutory rules, for damages to the user that have been caused intentionally or with gross negligence, that are the consequence of non-availability of a guaranteed specification of the service, that are the result of a culpable injury to health, body or life, or that are subject to compulsory liability under the law, in particular liability under the German Product Liability Act. 9.3 For other damages, the liability in case of a breach of a material contractual obligation (known as a cardinal obligation) is limited to damages that have to be typically and foreseeably expected in the scope of provision of a service such as the contractual service. 9.4 Cardinal obligations are contractual obligations whose performance enables the proper implementation of the contract at all and the adherence to which the contractual parties can usually rely on, and the breach of which, on the other hand, jeopardizes the achievement of the contractual aim. 9.5 Under contracts for free services, regardless of the provisions of Sections 9 (1) to 9 (3), we are only liable for intent and gross negligence in accordance with the statutory liability scope of Section 521 BGB [German Civil Code]. 9.6 Apart from that, liability against us as well as against our performing or vicarious agents is excluded regardless of the legal reason for such liability. 9.7 If damages to the user result from the loss of data, we are not liable for this if the damages could be prevented through regular, complete back-up of all relevant data by the user, with a frequency appropriate to the value of the data. In case of liability, we are liable only for the damages that would occur with regular, complete back-up of all relevant data, with a frequency appropriate to the value of the data. 10. Warranty Any warranty claims arising based on the nature of the service concerned, applicable statutory rules generally apply. However, the warranty period is reduced to one year, except in the case of claims for damages due to defects, resulting from non-availability of a guaranteed specification of the service, resulting from a culpable injury to health, body or life, or that are subject to liability under the Product Liability Act. We do not assume guarantees. 11. Fee-based Services The following addition provisions apply to fee-based offers: 11.1. Contract Conclusion (1) The contract for the use of our fee-based content or services arises upon registration for the desired and chosen payment system provider, agreement to the GTCs and the corresponding acceptance by us. (2) By registering for a fee-based service and completing the entry of the corresponding payment information in the system, you are submitting a binding offer to conclude a contract for the provision of the respective service. Descriptions of services on our internet pages or in our mobile application are only a non-binding invitation to you to submit a corresponding offer. (3) Acceptance by us takes place at the latest once access to the fee-based functions or parts is open to you. We accept or reject your offer, in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to make fee-based offers only accessible in certain regions. This is based mainly, but not exclusively, on whether we can guarantee the payment of taxes to the respective authorities. You have no claim to us offering a fee-based service in your region.(4) You can read in the specifications of the chosen product whether the respective fee-based offer is subject to a one-time payment or is automatically extended if it is not canceled and therefore is subject to a recurrent payment. 11.2. Right to Withdraw If you are the consumer and maintain a residence within the EU or the European Economic Area, you have a 14-day right to withdraw. You can find the withdrawal instructions and the template withdrawal form in Sections 17 and 18 of these GTCs. 11.3. Costs (1) The prices of individual performance, services and content that we offer are found in the respective offer. The indicated prices include the respective applicable statutory value-added tax, if your place of residence or registered office or the place of your permanent residence is within the European Union or the European Economic Area or in another location subject to a law that prescribes the specification of a total price. (2) If your place of residence or registered office or the place of your permanent residence is in the USA or in another country where the specification of net prices is prescribed or common, then are prices exclude the applicable statutory value-added tax. (3) The differences in the price presentation are determined by our payment service software using your geographic information based on your IP address. Therefore, for a correct presentation of the prices, you have to register without using anonymization software (e.g. VPN connections, TOR browser). A claim to lower prices or withdrawal due to incorrect price information is therefore excluded if the incorrect prices are shown due to a hardware or software used by you that makes it impossible for us to show you the correct prices. (4) The prices for any recurrent payments may reduce or increase in the course of the user’s subscription. Such changes do not affect the ongoing contractual periods. A price increase that occurs during an ongoing contractual period is effective only once the user agrees to it. Otherwise, your current contract will expire at the end of the ongoing contractual period without the need for a notice of cancellation by one of the parties. (5) Reduced prices for testing periods (e.g. a reduced price during the minimum contractual term) may be taken advantage of only once per person. (6) The costs for the respective contractual period are payable to us in advance and due immediately after completion of the order and, thereafter, by the start of the next contractual period. (7) The term cannot be interrupted. Therefore, a reimbursement of the payments made for such interruptions is not considered either. (8) Various payment options may be offered (e.g. credit card, debit or PayPal), but we are not obliged to do so. Currently, we are using Stripe as a payment service provider, which is completely free of charge for you. For payment processing via payment system providers (e.g. PayPal), only the terms and conditions of that payment system provider apply; in addition, the user may need to have an account with that provider. The payment process may also be offered, supported and simplified by other service providers that provide what is known as “single sign-on solutions”. (9) After a purchase, the user can receive a receipt for the ordered services in electronic format to the e-mail address provided by him. (10) If the user does not meet his payment obligations or reverses or charges back the amounts paid, we have the right, regardless of other claims, to block the user’s access to our products and services in full or with respect to the fee-based content or services. If access is blocked due to outstanding payments and the user settles them, access will be restored. Furthermore, we can limit or block access to free services in full or in part for payers who are in default. 11.4. Warranty for Fee-based Services (1) If, contrary to expectations, you would like to complain about our fee-based services due to incomplete or defective performance, you would have to make the complaints according to the terms of use of your chosen payment system provider either to us or to the payment provider immediately after learning about the incomplete or defective performance. (2) If we are liable due to justified and timely complaints, we will complete performance in case of an incomplete one and improve or replace at our discretion in case of defective performance. You may request the reduction of fees if we refused improvement attempts or replacement performance, if they are impossible or otherwise definitively failed. (3) Apart from that, the statutory defect rights according to German law apply. (4) If you are not a consumer as defined in Section 13 BGB, the warranty is limited to one year, except in the case of a building or a product used for buildings. 11.5. Cancellation of Fee-based Services (1) Fee-based services can be cancelled by both parties at the end of each contractual period.The term is indicated in the individual offers. (2) Generally, please make all cancellations according to these GTCs using your dashboard, which you will find in the plugin. If you cannot log in to the dashboard for whichever reason, please send us an e-mail from your e-mail address that you used to register with us. (3) Our fee-based services usually have a specific minimum contractual term starting on the day of contract conclusion. The minimum contractual term applicable to the service in question and/or the different minimum contractual terms that may be offered to the user are found in our offer. Depending on the offer and the chosen payment method, the corresponding contract is then extended automatically for the respective minimum contractual term, subject to other agreements, but for a maximum of one year each time, unless it is canceled at the latest one day before the expiry of the minimum contractual term or the ongoing extension term. (4) In the case of payment methods that do not allow for an automatic contract extension and regular charges, the contractual term ends automatically upon expiry of the contractual term without the need for a cancellation notice. (5) If we make it possible for you to switch to another of our services during an existing contract, a new contractual term for the new contract begins overall with the period of the respective minimum term of the new offer. In turn, Section 11.5. (3) and (4) applies to the new contractual term. As a result, the contractual term may be extended without the possibility of a prior regular cancellation in the “old” contractual period. Payments already made will be generally offset against the invoice for the new contractual period. (6) Both parties may terminate the contract with immediate effect for an important reason. 12. Technical Requirements (1) You need a computer or a mobile device with internet access to be able to use our services. (2) The respective specifications for our products and services contain the corresponding hardware and software requirements that your system must meet in order to be able to use the respective product. These are the minimal conditions necessary to be able to offer the products and services in a stable manner at all. However, a limited user experience (e.g. system slowdown) may be associated with these minimal conditions. Therefore, we recommend having a system configuration that exceeds our minimum requirements. (3) You are responsible for checking whether your system meets the technical requirements in order to be able to use our services. We recommend that you check this before ordering our fee-based services. We have the right to payment regardless of whether or not your system meets the technical requirements. (4) To be able to use our products and services, you ultimately need an internet connection. When downloading and using our products and services, you may incur transmission costs from the internet access provider that you use. The same applies to the use of our products and services and the associated additional services and content. 13. Data Privacy All information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by us is found in our privacy policy. 14. Cancellation of Free Use (1) Each party may terminate the free use agreement at any time. To do this, simply uninstall the program or the app that you use for our products and services. (2) Termination for an important reason remains reserved for each party. An important reason is, in particular, if one party continues to breach material provisions of these GTCs despite warning. (3) Upon entry into effect of the cancellation, access will be blocked. (4) Each user has the right to terminate the use as a whole or, if technically possible, for individual functions at any time. 15. Amendment of the GTCs (1) We reserve the right to amend these GTCs at any time and without providing reasons. The amended GTCs will be sent to the user in a suitable manner and, if applicable, by e-mail. (2) The new GTCs will be deemed agreed if the user does not object to them within 6 weeks after receipt of the notification. The objection must be made in writing, e.g. by e-mail. The options to object, the deadline and the consequences of his inaction will be indicated to the user separately in the notification. Alternatively, the amended GTCs could be presented to the user during the next time he signs in to our products and services. In this case, the amended GTCs will be agreed with a consumer once the consumer agrees to them during the next time he signs in. They are considered agreed with the consumer if the consumer does not object their validity within 6 weeks after first presentation. The objection must be made in writing, e.g. by e-mail. We will indicate the options to object, the deadline and the consequences of his inaction to the user separately in the presentation of the amended GTCs.(3) If the user objects to the validity of the new GTCs, both we and you have the right to cancel the contract. It then ends immediately or upon expiry of the period agreed for the fee-based service. In case of such a cancellation, you will receive a reimbursement of the fee paid corresponding to the duration. 16. Final Provisions (1) The GTCs including their interpretation are subject exclusively to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. Application of German and European conflict of laws principles and the UN Sales Convention is explicitly excluded. This applies also to offers in other countries. (2) These GTCs are generally not set out in a separate contract text individually related to the user, which the user can then access later on. However, the content of the contract with the user arises from these GTCs and, if applicable, additional agreements reached at least in text form, e.g. specifications and mutual other agreements of the contracting parties. (3) The contract can only be concluded in German. Translations are a mere service without claim to the respective language being the contractual language. The contract is concluded in German regardless of country and region. (4) If individual provisions of these GTCs including this provision are fully or partially invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions or parts of such provisions will remain unaffected. The invalid or missing provision will be replaced by the corresponding statutory rules under German law. (5) Munich is the exclusive place of jurisdiction, unless there is a statutory exclusive place of jurisdiction according to German law, if you are a merchant, legal person under public law or a public special fund or you do not have general jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany. (6) You have no general jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany if you do not have any residence or permanent residence in the Federal Republic of Germany. 17. Cancellation Policy (1) The GTCs including their interpretation are subject exclusively to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.
