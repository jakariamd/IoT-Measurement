(i.e., Would you spend your own money on it?) Is it appropriate for the job function of the recipient? Is it associated with purchasing, procurement or contracting decisions? Is it given and accepted without an express or implied understanding that the recipient is in any way obligated by acceptance of the gift? Is it given to or received from a government official?

Money laundering is not limited to cash transactions. Money laundering may hide financing for criminal activities such as terrorism, illegal narcotics trade, bribery, and fraud.
