This is considered vital for national development, ensuring that such actions require the consent of all relevant parties. President Ranil Wickremesinghe this week sought the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to direct the Legal Draftsman in preparing a bill to ensure the enforcement of bilateral and multilateral agreements, safeguarding against any deviation from them without the consent of the relevant parties. In May this year, the Cabinet of Ministers decided to enact laws to prevent deviations from bilateral and multilateral agreements without the consent of relevant parties as the country faced a diplomatic backlash following the cancellation of several international agreements including East Container Terminal (ECT) and Light Railway Transit (LRT) projects. Backtracking on Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement by the previous government led by former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is also a case in point. Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Bandula Gunawardena emphasised that such arbitrary decisions without consulting other parties had damaged the country’s credibility in the global stage. At present, Sri Lanka is in the process of entering into a number of new bilateral trade agreements along with plans to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). In addition, the government has also requested the Japanese government to revive the canceled Light Railway Transit (LRT) project. The proposed legislation is expected to restrict future governments from arbitrarily canceling or deviating from bilateral and multilateral agreements without obtaining the consent of the other party and thereby restoring Sri Lanka’s credibility globally.

While addressing the media he said the Cabinet granted its approval on September 17, 2019 for an agreement between the BoI and the Hambantota Oil Refinery (Pvt.) Ltd. for the construction of a petroleum refinery with a capacity of 420,000 barrels per day in the Hambantota area to cater only to the export market. "An extent of 1,200 acres of land had also been allocated on a 50-year long-term lease basis for the implementation of the project. But the project proponent has not acquired the relevant land on a lease basis and the project has not been implemented up to now," the Minister said. The project proponent has been informed several times in writing regarding the implementation of the project, but they have not responded. The project proponent has not acted according to the provisions of the agreement between the two parties, Minister Gunawardana added.
