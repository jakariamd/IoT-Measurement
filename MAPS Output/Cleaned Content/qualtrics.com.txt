As part of a global group of companies operating internationally, Qualtrics has affiliates (the “SAP Group”) and third-party service providers outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and will transfer your Personal Data to countries outside the EEA. If these transfers are to a country for which the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Qualtrics uses the EU standard contractual clauses to contractually require that your Personal Data receives a level of data protection consistent with the EEA. You can obtain a copy of such standard contractual clauses by sending a request to privacy@qualtrics.com. You can also obtain more information from the European Commission on the international dimension of data protection here. What are your data protection rights? You can request from Qualtrics access at any time to information about which Personal Data Qualtrics processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Data.

This could include matching two or more data points that are already maintained by Qualtrics.

Qualtrics will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law. If you take the view that Qualtrics is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where Qualtrics is incorporated.
