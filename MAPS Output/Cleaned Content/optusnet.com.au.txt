I'm holding a double-elim tournament and a loser in the winner's bracket leaves before playing in the loser's bracket. Can I remove the player from the tournament? A. Yes, you can by right-mouse clicking on the player that left and click on Remove player in the menu. This will readjust all the tables and byes to accommodate the player who left prematurely. Q14 .

Make sure you click on the OK button to close the manager.

What do the version numbers mean? A. The first number is the "major version" number - this is one and will be so for quite a while. The second number is the "minor version" number, and this is usually incremented with a major new feature being introduced (ie. prior to triple-elim, the version was 1.0, and with triple-elim, became 1.1). The third number is the "release" number. This is incremented everytime a version is released with any new functionality. The last number is the "build" number. This is incremented everytime a new version is sent out, including bug fixes, and also includes releases to a few people experiencing problems that can test it for me before release. Q18 . Is this written in VB (Visual Basic)? A. No, it is not written in VB or any other Microsoft product. Of course the next question from some of the tech-heads out there is what is it written in? It is written in Borland's Delphi (Object Oriented Pascal), and yes, the author uses C and C++ for his day-to-day job! More Q & As to come.
