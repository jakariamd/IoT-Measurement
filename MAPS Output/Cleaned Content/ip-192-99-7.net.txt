Cookies and third-party media Entities in the OVH Group are presented in different types of media (websites, social networks, etc.) managed by third parties, on which they publish content and launch campaigns that display advertising messages. When you view or interact with OVHcloud content or advertising shared on third-party media, this browsing data can be communicated to OVHcloud (namely via the use of pixels). Its purpose is to ensure that the content and campaigns shared are relevant (e.g. knowing if you have visited our website or viewed certain pages after an advertising campaign). The diffusion of OVH advertising on third-party media may be linked due to the fact that the cookies stored on your device (e.g. a cookie left during a previous visit to an OVH Group website) reflect a potential interest in products and services from the OVH Group. Moreover, when you visit third-party media, cookies may be installed on your device. To find out more, please read the usage policies for cookies that apply to the third parties. 4.
