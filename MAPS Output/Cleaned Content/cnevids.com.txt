Things are nice. 00:37 I like going out and getting coffee 00:38 or going for a drive and stuff 00:39 but if I were to think about it, I'm absolutely fine. 00:44 [both laughing] 00:45 I'm doing fine here. 00:47 [laughs] I love it. 00:48 Actually, with the hair, you're just on point for lockdown. 00:51 You don't have to worry about the haircuts or anything. 00:53 Well, exactly. 00:54 Maintenance has been at a very low level, really. 00:56 It's just the problem comes when it gets to lunchtime 00:59 and Claire points out 01:00 I've got a bit of granola left in my beard. 01:04 We started strong on the TV front, 01:06 and then, it's a world away, 01:09 but I think we'll definitely get started again. 01:13 We watched all three seasons of Ozark in about, 01:16 I think that should really take you a long time 01:18 but it took us about a week. 01:20 Oh wow! 01:21 They're long episodes as well. 01:22 Yeah, we overdid it. 01:25 So now we need something else. 01:29 I thought I would cook a little bit more.01:33 I did say to Claire, I said to my wife that, 01:36 maybe I could just help you cook 01:39 or make dinner and everything, 01:40 and I did one meal and then decided, 01:43 this probably isn't for me and I haven't tried it since, 01:45 so that one started and stopped pretty sharpish. 01:49 It's funny that, isn't it, that you think, 01:51 'I'm not doing these hobbies 01:52 or these things because I don't have time', 01:54 but then you have time, you try it, and you're like, 01:56 'yeah, I'm just not doing this because'-- 01:58 Yeah, there was a reason why I didn't do this stuff. 02:00 It's actually really funny as well when you think, 02:02 I mean we've got all the time in the world at the moment 02:04 but then you have days where you feel like 02:06 there was no time. 02:07 I don't know [mumbles], like, dust around or something 02:10 but then the day's gone. 02:11 Now on the golfing front, what have you been doing 02:13 to keep the game sharp 02:14 or what have you been managing to do? 02:16 Well I don't know about sharp. 02:17 But I do, I mean I have a couple of things 02:20 in my house: stocking up balls, 02:22 I have a simulator and a putting green. 02:24 And I've enjoyed doing that. 02:26 I've not done it with any intensity 02:29 or anything like that 02:30 but it's been nice just being able to like clip some balls 02:34 or at times or mess around in there with kids. 02:37 And well, basically, like, kept in contact with everyone 02:41 coaches and stuff and and friends from the tour. 02:47 Yeah, so that's that's been that's been nice. 02:50 I've watched a few golf programs. 02:54 If I can learn anything. 02:55 The reruns. 02:56 Yeah, there's plenty of reruns going on. 02:59 The majors have really been shifted around 03:00 and canceled in terms of the Open. 03:03 As a Brit how gut wrenching was that? 03:07 Yeah, I think it was. 03:11 That was clearly such a hard decision for the RNA 03:14 and a lot of thought went into it. 03:20 The Open hasn't been played this year 03:21 but I think one of the key messages 03:22 was that the 149th Open will take place 03:25 it's just a year down the line 03:27 and I think it was important to look at it that way. 03:31 Again, we've never really 03:33 been in this situation before 03:34 and I don't think there's any right or wrong, 03:35 and I certainly would like to be one of them 03:40 making the decisions about everything at the moment. 03:42 So, you know, you just respect whatever the decision is 03:45 and we'll still get to play the Open, 03:48 it's just a year later. 03:49 Starting so late and everything being jam packed 03:51 in together potentially as well, 03:52 [talking over each other] 03:56 I mean, mentally, to go from major to major to major, 04:01 and potentially with Ryder Cup as well, 04:02 I mean, there's going to be a lot, right? 04:05 Well, yeah and it feels like sort of silly to 04:08 say that it will be really mentally straining to 04:11 have a few majors at the same time and eratic but it will. 04:15 It's just, it's different. 04:16 It's competition at the end of the day 04:19 and the majors take a lot out of you and 04:22 especially if you happen to play well, 04:26 which, of course, is what everybody wants to 04:27 do everybody wants to be up there in contention 04:30 but that really will, you'll be tired at the end of it. 04:34 But we don't know whether we'll be playing the U.S. Open 04:40 and thinking, 04:41 'Oh, this is amazing, just to be playing golf'. 04:42 But in real competition mode it'll be, again like you 04:46 don't really know how we're going to feel 04:47 but you know I would quite happily take being 04:52 knackered in December and haven't done well in them. 04:56 Yeah, for sure. 04:57 Let's talk Ryder Cup, because that's build 05:00 at the moment to still be in 05:01 that same slot but one of the rumors, I should say 05:04 that have been going around, is maybe a fan-less Ryder Cup. 05:07 What are your thoughts on that? 05:10 It would be strange. 05:13 I did hear that and I was kind of against it straightaway.05:17 But also, you know, still I think sport does have 05:22 it's place in society or something as big as 05:25 the Ryder Cup would be a nice torch for like a change of 05:31 the times and seen as getting back to a better place 05:34 but it would seem, I've only played one, 05:37 but after that one, it would seem very odd to play 05:40 in a very sort of quiet atmosphere. 05:45 And I don't know, if I was to give my honest opinion, 05:48 I would say it doesn't really feel right without fans. 05:52 But if they want to play, 05:53 again, I'm not going to be that person that says, 'no'. 05:55 'No I'm good on that?' 05:57 [both laugh] 05:58 Yeah I completely get that. 06:00 On the one hand the fans make it, on the other hand, 06:01 you want it to be this standing torch of resilience. 06:04 Sure. 06:05 And every time the Ryder Cup comes around 06:08 it's the biggest sporting occasion in the world by miles 06:12 and we're lucky enough to play in it 06:14 but part of why it's so amazingly great is the fans as well. 06:18 So, like I said, 06:21 both sides of the story are: 06:23 it will be amazing to be playing golf 06:24 and be amazing to say the Ryder Cup is being played. 06:29 But without fans it just seems a little bit weird. 06:31 Now you mentioned that you've only played one Ryder Cup, 06:33 obviously that went pretty well for you. Nice memories. 06:37 How much have you in this period of being at home, 06:40 had a chance to reflect on the last few years? 06:44 Because it has been a little bit of a whirlwind for you. 06:46 Have you really had time to digest everything 06:49 and think on it? 06:51 Well yeah the last two or three years have been great and 06:54 played very well, very consistently. 06:57 I would say I'm more of a 07:00 'look forwards rather than backwards'. 07:06 It's nice to look back on a few memories and 07:08 I think with some of the replays that have been on, 07:10 say the Ryder Cup in Paris or 07:13 I actually watched the Open from last year, the other day, 07:15 which I did not want to watch at all, anytime. 07:19 'I'm not gonna watch that' or 'I don't want to watch it', 07:22 but you know I watched that and 07:24 it's good watching golf, actually. 07:26 Even, other tournaments that you weren't part of 07:28 and watch how they unfolded 07:30 and I feel like having a chance to watch because 07:33 in general I kind of play week in, week out 07:36 and when you do get away from it, 07:38 you don't really feel like watching golf too much. 07:41 You just want to get a little bit of rest from it 07:42 so actually watching some tournaments and reruns 07:45 and seeing how tournament unfold or 07:46 seeing what the winners do. 07:48 And how they cross the line is actually, it can be 07:52 quite educational, sometimes it's like Tiger's winning by 07:55 15 or something and then you know you 07:57 don't really learn too much from that. 07:58 It was very, very good. 08:00 You just enjoy watching? [laughs] 08:01 Watching, I probably wouldn't have won that one. 08:05 What are some of the things that have stood out for you? 08:07 Like, it's interesting you say that when you watch it 08:09 you're getting some things from it. 08:11 What are some of those things that stand out? 08:14 I think if you're ever watching yourself I think you just 08:16 watch your mannerisms or the way you think. 08:21 I feel like I should remember some of the shots 08:23 but I don't know how I was thinking over them. 08:24 I remember, hitting the shots but actually going back 08:26 and looking: 'what was I thinking there?' 08:27 or 'what was I doing?' 08:30 and in general, it's good just to watch how you were. 08:32 And then the tournaments you do, watching the majors, 08:36 it's just interesting to watch just how sort of 08:41 volatile the leaderboards can be at times. 08:43 And sometimes things just open up for the guy that won, 08:47 sometimes it's somebody that just plays that good, 08:49 that nobody can beat him 08:52 and sometimes it just doesn't happen for somebody else 08:55 but it's interesting just watching. 08:58 Because when you're in those positions, 09:01 you either win or you don't. 09:03 And then you try and look back 09:05 and think what could you have done better. 09:06 But you never really look at what everybody else did 09:08 or what happened to them and stuff 09:09 so it's interesting watching you know a bunch of 09:12 guys go at it.09:13 Yeah, it's tough to see the big picture 09:15 when you're trying to win the tournament itself. 09:18 I'm gonna finish up on your caddy Ian 'Fino' Finnis, 09:22 he's been doing some great work for 09:24 the European Caddie Association. 09:28 I'll let you tell a little bit more about that 09:30 and what he's been doing and how people can get involved. 09:33 Fino just decided he wanted to help his, 09:35 our own industry and the caddies that were struggling 09:38 and completely understood what they're going through 09:40 when we started out and I was playing terrible 09:43 and you know not making much 09:44 and he originally just came up with the idea, 09:47 he was going to try and get a few prizes do like a bit 09:49 of a raffle and an auction. 09:51 I think it was 10 pound, a ticket. 09:54 I think his first one raised, 30,000, 09:59 which is, I mean, just the response was amazing 10:01 and then it went that good that 10:03 he thought he would do it again, 10:07 and there's so many golfers and caddies 10:12 and members of the golf world that have got involved. 10:14 Yeah this is brilliant and if you want to get involved, 10:16 check out Fino on Twitter. He's @FinoEFC. 10:20 All right, well, Tommy, thank you so much. 10:24 Keep enjoying lock down. 10:28 If it starts turning sour, I'll let you know 10:30 but I'm good so far. 10:31 [laughs together] 10:32 Sounds great. We'll speak to soon. 10:35 Thanks, Henni. Thank you.
