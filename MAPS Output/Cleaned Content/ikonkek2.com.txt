One form of Opt-out is clicking the Unsubscribe link in a marketing email. This will take you off of our marketing email list. CNCT's general policy is to have users Opt-in, rather than Opt-out, to receive marketing information and to allow the sharing of information with third parties.

Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We also use cloud-based applications and services to store and process your Personal Information, which may result in your Personal Information being stored outside your country of residence (or the EEA or ANZ).

We note again that, if you choose to no longer receive marketing information from us, we may still communicate with you about other matters, such as product and service updates for CNCT Products you have purchased and customer support matters. Retention of Personal Information We will only retain your Personal Information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required for legitimate business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise as permitted by law. Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Web Tools We use automatic data collection tools like cookies, embedded web links and widgets (collectively, "web tools"). These web tools collect certain information that your browser or your mobile device sends to CNCT websites and CNCT Products, such as computer IP address, browser type and service provider. In addition, CNCT uses small pieces of code called web beacons. Web beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through a graphic image request. This allows CNCT to collect information such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referring page you previously visited, what browser or mobile device you are using, and your display settings. CNCT and its advertising partners use web beacons, for example, to find out if advertising on CNCT websites and other websites that contain CNCT ads is effective, or if certain videos on CNCT websites are being viewed. CNCT may use web tools for the following purposes: ¡¤ To identify the user's country and language and distinguish you from other users of CNCT websites. ¡¤ To save your registration information for future use on CNCT websites and services. ¡¤ To allow customer surveys to appear or not appear to customers. To optimize your browsing experience by preloading certain features of CNCT websites and services on future visits to make loading times faster and more efficient. ¡¤ To understand how you use and interact with CNCT websites and services. ¡¤ To customize and provide you with a more personal experience when visiting CNCT websites or our advertising partners' websites or when using CNCT Products. ¡¤ To improve CNCT websites and services. ¡¤ To count visitors to CNCT websites and CNCT Products and analyze website traffic, such as how many visitors have come to the CNCT websites from advertisements on advertising partner websites. You have the following choices regarding CNCT's use of web tools: ¡¤ You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser or mobile device. However, many features of CNCT websites and CNCT Products may not work as intended if you disable cookies, and areas that require registration or authentication and CNCT website store transactions will not be accessible. ¡¤ For some CNCT Products, you can go into the account settings and select an option that will remove you from personalized advertising. If you select this option, you will receive generic advertising as part of these CNCT Products rather than advertising that has been tailored based on your preferences. ¡¤ Many advertising companies are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative and provide opt-out choices on their websites. We do not currently respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we participate. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. Visit the following website, www.allaboutdnt.org , for more information on this developing area. In addition to CNCT's use of web beacons on CNCT websites, we allow certain third parties who provide CNCT advertising on their websites to use their own web beacons within CNCT websites. In that case, if you click on or view a CNCT ad on one of our advertising partners' websites and are redirected or go to the CNCT website, the advertising partner places a web beacon on your browser so that we can track advertising conversions (which let us know if an ad was effective). These web beacons will appear on your browser regardless of whether you have refused to accept cookies or indicated that you do not want to be tracked on CNCT websites or on the Internet generally. However, they are only used by CNCT for the limited purpose of tracking advertising conversions and do not identify you personally in any way.Third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use CNCT websites. To avoid tracking by these third parties, you can exercise the choices above to reject cookies, although CNCT has no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the do not track browser choices you have made. Security We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information collected by CNCT websites and CNCT Products. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security; any transmission is at your own risk. It is important to note that if you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted Personal Information. If you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access. We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. You should also be aware that names that you give your Wi-Fi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as "friendly names") may be detectable by others outside your home, so you should not use Personal Information as part of your friendly names. Updates and Upgrades CNCT Products may be updated or upgraded from time to time to provide additional features, address technical issues, and generally make your user experience better. Some CNCT Products include an auto-update feature, which gives us the ability to make updates automatically. You can change auto-update options by changing your settings within the CNCT Product account information. In very limited cases, updates may still be automatically applied, regardless of the auto-update setting. For example, we may provide an automatic update that prevents or fixes a security vulnerability or breach to your network. Third Party and Social Media Linked Sites CNCT websites and online services may contain links to websites or online services operated by third parties. CNCT Products may also use or offer products and services from third parties, such as a third party app that works with a CNCT Product. Once you leave CNCT websites and CNCT Products, your activities are governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of the third party websites and online services. CNCT is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites and online services, and we encourage you to carefully read the terms of use and privacy policies of any website and online service you visit. CNCT websites and CNCT Products may contain social media features, such as Facebook "Like" buttons. These features may collect information about your device's IP address, set cookies to facilitate interaction with social media features or link you to a social media website where you may post Personal Information. All interactions with social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing the feature.
