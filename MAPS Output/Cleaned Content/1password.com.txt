View plans Talk to sales SupportGet HelpSupport hubCommunity forumTalk to supportProductResourcesSupportPricing Security is not just a feature. It‚Äôs our foundation. Every design decision in 1Password begins with the safety and privacy of your data in mind. The information you store in 1Password is encrypted, and only you hold the keys to decrypt it. 1Password is designed to protect you from breaches and other threats, and we work with other security experts to make sure our code is rock solid. We can‚Äôt see your 1Password data, so we can‚Äôt use it, share it, or sell it. Only you have access to your 1Password data. Your 1Password data is end-to-end encrypted to keep it safe at rest and in transit. Our security recipe starts with AES 256-bit encryption, and we use multiple techniques to make sure only you have access to your information. Your Account Password protects your data on your devices. Only you know your Account Password: it‚Äôs never stored alongside your data or sent over the network. It protects your data if someone has access to your device. Your Secret Key protects your data off your devices. Your Secret Key is created locally on your device. It‚Äôs combined with your Account Password to authenticate you with our server and encrypt your 1Password data. Secure Remote Password protects your data in transit. Your 1Password account uses SRP to authenticate your credentials without sending them over the Internet. It also encrypts all traffic sent to our server. 1Password is private by design. All data saved in your vaults is end-to-end encrypted using secrets that only you know. We only collect the information necessary to provide our services and build you a better 1Password. 1Password protects you from breaches and other threats. 1Password security begins with encryption, and we‚Äôve taken additional steps to limit your exposure to threats outside of 1Password. Alerts you to security breaches Watchtower alerts you about password breaches and other security problems with your 1Password items. Protects you from phishing You can fool a human, but you can‚Äôt fool 1Password. It only fills your account details on the sites where you saved them. Only works in verified browsers 1Password only fills your details after it verifies that your browser has been signed by an identified developer. Removes secrets from your clipboard To prevent people or clipboard tools from learning your secrets, 1Password regularly removes item details from the clipboard. Intelligent autofill 1Password securely fills credentials directly into websites, so you don‚Äôt have to type or paste your password. Always requires your input To protect your data from shoulder surfers and browser-based attacks, 1Password only displays or fills data when you tell it to. 1Password complies with the most stringent industry standards for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Secrets Automation Secure, orchestrate, and manage your company's infrastructure secrets with 1Password Secrets Automation. We describe our security design in our white paper. We‚Äôve documented our entire security design for experts to review. Here are just a few of the processes we cover: Tamper-proof, authenticated encryptionBrute-force protection with PBKDF2Secure vault sharingAccount recovery We use open standards that are scrutinized by the experts. 1Password wasn‚Äôt built in a vacuum. It was developed on top of open standards that anyone with the right skills can investigate, implement, and improve. We collaborate with other security experts to make sure 1Password is rock solid. "The security controls observed in the 1Password application were found to be substantial and unusually impressive." 1Password Business Everything you need to secure your business and fortify your defenses.1Password Families A family password manager solution that will bring peace of mind for you and your family. 1PasswordLearn moreSupportLocationsCompanyDownloadsWeb BrowserCommand LineDeutschEspa√±olFran√ßaisItalianoÊó•Êú¨Ë™ûÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥Portugu√™sP—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–πÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠ÊñáÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá üç™ We use cookies to provide necessary functionality and improve your experience.

Information Collected Through the 1Password Services We collect some data from you, in order to provide you with our 1Password products and Services, in addition to your use of our Website. You provide some data directly, such as when you create a 1Password account, when you register for a 1Password event or a webinar, or contact us for support.

In particular, we use your data to provide 1Password services, which includes updating, securing and troubleshooting, and providing support. The following is a more detailed description of the types of 1Password account user data: We process two kinds of user data to deliver our services: (i) Secure Data and (ii) Service Data. Both are treated securely with respect for customer privacy and data confidentiality, but there are important technical and usage differences. (i) Secure Data Secure Data are the data that we are not capable of decrypting under any circumstance. It includes all information stored within vaults in 1Password accounts. These data are encrypted using secure cryptographic keys that exist only in the possession and under the control of our customers. We have no way of accessing or providing decrypted Secure Data, and we never receive copies of unencrypted Secure Data. Your Secure Data is your property.We claim no rights to it beyond those necessary to deliver services to you. You may add, modify, and delete Secure Data at your discretion. If you do not have a 1Password account, you cannot provide us with Secure Data. (ii) Service Data We inevitably acquire Service Data about your usage of 1Password, your account, and your payments through operating our services. We retain only enough Service Data to operate and maintain the services. These data are never used for any other purpose. Service Data are kept confidential. It is visible to our staff and includes, but is not limited to, server logs, billing information, client IP addresses, number of vaults and number of items in vaults, company or family name, and email addresses. Service data includes the name you provide us for your profile and any image that you may upload, at your option and discretion, as part of your profile. As long as you are using our services, we retain the right to hold and use Service Data to provide our services, troubleshoot problems, analyze the performance and demands on our services, and to provide our payment processors with the information they need to process payments. (iii) Diagnostic Data (Optional) Diagnostic Data are a category of Service Data which are not automatically collected or required for operation of our services. In some cases we seek diagnostic reports and other troubleshooting, bug, and crash reports from customers to help identify and solve problems with our products and services. This information is sent to us only on a case by case basis, or by users who explicitly opt into our beta software programs or who otherwise explicitly choose to provide diagnostic data to us. Diagnostic Data may contain sensitive information about your devices and operating environment as well as personally identifying information. Although there may be occasions when we ask for Diagnostic Data to assist you with a problem, you are never obligated to provide it. Diagnostic data never includes decrypted Secure Data. We will never ask for your Account Password or Secret Key. Keeping Your Information Safe We understand and accept our responsibility to protect Service Data and Secure Data. We use strict access control mechanisms, network isolation, and encryption to ensure that Secure and Service Data is only available to authorized personnel. Additionally, Secure Data cannot be decrypted even by those who do have access to it.

AgileBits is a Canadian company, we are not U.S.- E.U. Privacy Shield certified. If you are affiliated to an organization who provides you with 1Password account through its Enterprise level account then there may be additional requirements for us to meet, based on the contracts with the organization. For further information, please read below the section 1Password Product or Account provided by your Organization . Data Location 1Password.eu data are held on servers located within the European Union. Secure Data originating in the European Union remains within the European Union. Customer support system Our customer support and email services are hosted primarily in the United States. Any information you choose send us through email or our customer support system may pass through and be stored on a variety of intermediate services. If you wish, you may encrypt email to us using our PGP public key . Third-Party Data Processors Your Secure and Service data are held by third-party data processors, who provide us with hosting and other infrastructure services. The locations of these are described above. In many cases (but we cannot promise that this will always be the case) even Service data held by these entities is encrypted with keys held only by us. Data needed to process payments is collected by our payment processor, Stripe, Inc., which conforms to the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield Framework. See https://stripe.com/in/legal/privacy-shield-policy Contacting You We may use your contact information, that is, the contact email address provided by you, to communicate with you about Service activity, provide support, and send you other information such as product updates and announcements. You may choose to stop receiving communications from us, except certain important notifications such as billing and account security alerts. Your Responsibilities for Protecting Your Data When you create a 1Password account you will receive a Secret Key and will be prompted to create a Account Password. Your Secret Key is generated on your computer and your Account Password is something you create yourself. For your protection, you should create a strong and unique Account Password to ensure that it is not easily guessed. It is extremely important that you understand that anyone with both your Secret Key and Account Password can access your Secure Data. It is equally important that you keep a copy in a safe place for your own reference, because future access to your Secure Data depends on having access to both your Secret Key and your Account Password. We will never ask you for your Account Password or your full Secret Key, and you should never send it to us or anyone. Due to the nature of our design and the sensitivity of the information you entrust to us (even in encrypted form), it may not be possible for us to help you with certain customer service requests unless you are listed as an account owner and are communicating from your verified email address. In the event that you change your email address, it is very important that you update your email on your 1Password account(s) or you may eventually lose access. Data Protection Principles that We Practice (i) Data Portability We want happy customers, not trapped ones. We will not lock you out of your own data. However, we are unable to decrypt your Secure Data; you will need your Account Password and Secret Key to decrypt it. You may export your 1Password data at any time you wish during the life of your account.If you discontinue payment, your account will enter a frozen (read-only) state for a period not less than six months during which you may still retrieve and export your data. Export is limited to your Secure Data. Vault permissions, the structure of groups of individuals, and other information about the relationship between individuals and data is not guaranteed to be included in export. (ii) Your Right to Know to What We Know You have the right to know what we know about you and to see how that data is handled. You may request a screenshot of what we can see about you in our back office systems. However, to protect customer privacy, such requests must be carefully authenticated beyond demonstrating control of the customer‚Äôs email address. (iii) Your Right to Have Your Data Erased As we are merely custodians of your data, account owners have the right to instruct us to remove data permanently from our systems. To ensure that no one‚Äôs data is deleted without their consent, you must first delete your account through an authenticated session. After your account has been deleted, the account owner may contact us and ask for the data to be expunged. Once the request is authenticated, the data will be removed from our active systems within 72 hours. Disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that AgileBits has a legitimate interest in maintaining secure and immutable backups. Backups are kept for 35 days. Erasure requests will leave those backups untouched, and we will only remove data from backups if legally compelled to. (iv) Your right to access and control your personal data You can also make choices about collection and use of your data by AgileBits. You can control your personal data and exercise your data protection rights by contacting AgileBits at the address and information provided below.
