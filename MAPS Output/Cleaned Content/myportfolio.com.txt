The CCPA defines personal information to include internet or other electronic network activity information which includes identifiers, such as IP addresses, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs.The law also defines a “sale” or “share” broadly to include simply making data available to third parties in some cases. To opt out of sharing and selling for purposes of cross context behavioral advertising you can: Review your preferences and opt out of advertising cookies and other technologies used for browser based cross context behavioral advertising. Note that you will need to opt out from each browser that you use to access Adobe websites and apps.
