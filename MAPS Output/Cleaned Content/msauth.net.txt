Microsoft Services Agreement Published: 15 June 2022 Effective: 15 August 2022 These terms ("Terms") cover the use of those Microsoft consumer products, websites and services listed at the end of these Terms here (https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement#serviceslist) (the "Services"). By providing the opportunity of subscribing for, using and/or ordering the Services, Microsoft makes an offer to you. You accept these Terms by creating a Microsoft account, by using the Services or by continuing to use the Services after being notified of a change to these Terms. Please read, print and save a copy of these Terms for your records because Microsoft won't save a copy for you. If you are a microenterprise, small enterprise or a not-for-profit organisation please read section 15 on waiving any entitlements that would otherwise be applicable to you under the European Electronic Communications Code. 1. Your Privacy. Your privacy is important to us. Please read the Microsoft Privacy Statement (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) (the "Privacy Statement") as it describes the types of data we collect from you and your devices ("Data"), how we use your Data and the legal bases we have to process your Data. The Privacy Statement also describes how Microsoft uses your content, which is your communications with others; postings submitted by you to Microsoft via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works, livestreams and videos that you upload, store, broadcast or share through the Services ("Your Content"). 2. Your Content. Many of our Services allow you to store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don't claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains Your Content and you are responsible for it. a. When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able, on a worldwide basis, to use, save, record, reproduce, broadcast, transmit, share and display Your Content for the purpose that you made Your Content available on the Services, without compensating you. If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these Terms you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use and retention of Your Content through the Services won't violate any law or rights of others. We strongly advise you to make regular back-up copies of Your Content. Microsoft can't be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using our Services. b. To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others (which may include changing the size, shape or format of Your Content to better store or display it to you), to protect you and the Services and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant Microsoft a worldwide and royalty free intellectual property licence to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, distribute via communication tools and display Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is rendered available online publicly or without restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service. Some of the Services are supported by advertising. Controls for how Microsoft personalises advertising are available at https://choice.live.com. We do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voicemail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies are covered in detail in the Privacy Statement. 3. Code of Conduct. a. Content, material or actions that violate these Terms are not permitted. By agreeing to these Terms, you're under the obligation to follow these rules: i. Don't do anything illegal. ii. Don't engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens to harm children. iii. Don't send spam or engage in phishing. Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant messages or similar electronic communications. Phishing is sending emails or other electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information, such as passwords, dates of birth, National Insurance Numbers, passport numbers, credit card information, financial information or other sensitive information or to gain access to accounts or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial benefit. iv. Don't publicly display or use the Services to share any inappropriate content or other material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence or criminal activity). v. Don't engage in activity that is fraudulent, false or misleading (e.g.asking for money under false pretences, impersonating someone else, manipulating the Services to increase play count or affect rankings, ratings or comments). vi. Don't willfully circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Services. vii. Don't engage in activity that is harmful to you, the Services or others (e.g. transmitting viruses, stalking, posting terrorist or violent extremist content, communicating hate speech or advocating violence against others). viii. Don't infringe upon the rights of others (e.g, unauthorised sharing of copyrighted music or other copyrighted material, resale or other distribution of Bing maps or photographs). ix. Don't engage in activity that violates the privacy of others. x. Don't help to others break these rules. b. Enforcement. We reserve the right to deny Your Content if it exceeds limits on storage or file size allowed by the Service. In addition, if you violate any of the obligations listed in section 3.a above or otherwise materially violate these Terms, we may take action against you including (without limitation) stopping providing Services or closing your Microsoft account immediately for good cause or blocking delivery of a communication (like email, file sharing or instant message) to or from the Services. We also reserve the right to remove or block Your Content from the Services at any time if it is brought to our attention that it may violate applicable law or these Terms. When investigating alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review Your Content in order to resolve the issue. However, we do not monitor the Services and make no attempt to do so. For more information on how Microsoft addresses certain types of violative content on our consumer services, see the Digital Safety Content Report (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/digital-safety-content-report). c. Application to Xbox Services. Click here (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=868531) for more information about how this Code of Conduct applies to all Xbox Services, including Xbox Game Pass, Games for Windows Live and Xbox Games Studios games, applications, services and content provided by Microsoft. Violations of the Code of Conduct through Xbox Services (defined in section 13.a.i) may result in suspensions or bans from participation in Xbox Services, including forfeiture of content licences, Xbox Gold Membership time and Microsoft account balances associated with the account. d. Microsoft Start Community Guidelines. The Microsoft Start Community Guidelines (https://www.msn.com/en-ie/community/guideline) govern registered user engagement with news and professionally generated content on that service. Violations of the Code of Conduct through the Microsoft Start Community Guidelines may result in suspensions or bans from community commenting or termination of Microsoft accounts. 4. Using the Services & Support. a. Microsoft account. You'll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners. i. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet Service Provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account. ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services or as otherwise required by law. If you don't sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656). iii. Kids and Accounts. By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of "majority" where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please do not create a Microsoft account before you have asked your parent or legal guardian for help. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and you are responsible for supervising your minor in the use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor's account is now open or created later. iv. Closing Your Account. 1. In addition to any rights you have to cancel as specified in the "Refund Policy" section below (section 9.g), you can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose to put it in a suspended state for either 30- or 60-days just in case you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. See section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate your Microsoft account. 2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we'll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result, you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you've stored on those Services) that require a Microsoft account. You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you've acquired. b. Work or School Accounts. You can sign in to certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organisation and these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services. c. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you'll need an Internet connection and/or data/mobile plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans and/or equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you. d. Service Notifications. When there's something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we'll send you Service notifications and information the law requires us to provide. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS. We recommend you monitor and maintain the email address you specified.If you don't consent to receive notices electronically, you must stop using the Services. e. Support. Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at https://www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services. If you live in Europe you can also refer a complaint to the EU's Online Dispute Resolution platform (https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr); please use MSODR@microsoft.com on the complaint form only and not for another purpose. f. Ending your Services. If your Services are cancelled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your licence to the software related to the Services ends. Second, we'll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result, you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you've stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you've acquired. If you have cancelled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be cancelled immediately. 5. Using Third-Party Apps and Services. The Services may allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content, material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from independent third parties (companies or people who aren't Microsoft) ("Third-Party Apps and Services"). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to, or interact with Third-Party Apps and Services or allow you to share Your Content or Data, and you understand that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party Apps and Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their terms before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See section 13.b for additional terms for applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft Store on Windows). You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies before acquiring, using, requesting, or linking your Microsoft Account to any Third-Party Apps and Services. Any third-party terms do not modify these Terms. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you as part of any Third-Party Apps and Services. You agree to assume all risk and liability arising from your use of these Third-Party Apps and Services and that Microsoft is not responsible or liable to you or others for information or services provided by any Third-Party Apps and Services. 6. Service Availability. a. The Services, Third Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered on a limited basis, or may vary depending on your region or device, or other external factors such as your internet or network connection. If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may need to re-acquire the products that were available to you and paid for in your previous region. b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, they are not offered with a guaranteed level of quality of service and all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages. In the event of an outage or disruption to the Service, you may temporarily not be able to retrieve Your Content. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services. 7. Updates to the Services or Software and Changes to These Terms. a. We'll inform you if we intend to change these Terms. We may change these Terms if it is necessary due to (i) applicable law, including, but not limited to, a change of such law; (ii) an advice and/or order based on applicable law; (iii) the evolution of the Services; (iv) technical reasons; (v) operational requirements or (vi) an advantageous change of terms for the user. We'll inform you of the intended change before it takes effect, either through the user interface, in an email message or through other reasonable means. We'll provide you the opportunity to cancel the Services at least 30 days before the change becomes effective. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms.If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services and close your Microsoft account in accordance with section 4.a.iv. We'll also expressly point to this fact when informing you about the intended change of these Terms. b. We may automatically check your version of the software, which is necessary to provide the Services and download software updates or configuration changes, without charging you, to update, enhance and further develop the Services. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates shall be subject to these Terms unless additional or other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. If you decline to accept the additional or other terms applicable to the updates, you may not receive or use the updates. Microsoft isn't obligated to make any updates available and doesn't guarantee that we will support the version of the system for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content or other products. You may be provided with automatic or manual updates, which are not necessary to ensure the conformity of the Services for the reasons outlined in this section. By accepting these Terms, you hereby agree to be provided with such updates. c. We continuously work to improve the Services and may change the Services or delete features or stop providing access to Third-Party Apps and Services in that respect at any time, including, without limitation, if our agreements with third parties no longer permit us to make their material available, if it is no longer feasible for us to provide it, the technology advances or if customer feedback indicates that a change is needed. We will notify you in advance if a change to the Services will cause you to lose access to Your Content. For paid Services, we'll also notify you in advance of other material changes to the Services. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 13.j) or applications previously purchased. If we cancel a paid Service, we'll refund to you on a pro-rata basis the amount of payments that you've made corresponding to the portion of that Service remaining right before the cancellation. d. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music, games, films, books and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM updates. 8. Software Licence. Unless accompanied by a separate Microsoft licence agreement (for example, if you are using a Microsoft application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft Software Licence Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software), any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms. Applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section 13.b.i below. a. If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Services. For certain devices, such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial use of the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may include third-party code. Any third party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the software or website, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the third-party code are included for your information only. b. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Microsoft under these Terms. This licence does not give you any right to, and you may not, unlawfully: i. circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services; ii. disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so; iii. separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices; iv. publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute or lend the software or the Services, unless Microsoft expressly authorises you to do so; v. transfer the software, any software licences or any rights to access or use the Services; vi. use the Services in any unauthorised way that could interfere with anyone else's use of them or gain access to any service, data, account or network; vii. enable access to the Services or modify any Microsoft-authorised device (e.g.Xbox consoles, Microsoft Surface, etc.) by unauthorised third-party applications. 9. Payment Terms. If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them. a. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services includes all applicable taxes, unless stated otherwise. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered, unless stated otherwise. After we have given you notice that we did not receive an on-time, full payment from you, we may suspend or cancel the Services if you do not make the full payment within the relevant time. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location. Depending on your location, some transactions might require foreign currency conversion or be processed in another country. Your bank might charge you additional fees for those services when you use a debit or credit card. Please contact your bank for details. b. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. For all Services other than Skype, you can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype software and products by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. If you tell us to stop using your payment method and don't provide us with another payment method after our notice to you to do so within an appropriate timeframe, we may suspend or cancel your paid Service for good cause. Changes made to your billing account won't affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account. c. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorised to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorise Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorise Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. As specified, we may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services and, in the case of a price change, provide you with the opportunity to cancel the Services before the price changes. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed. d. Recurring Payments. When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g. monthly, every three months or annually), you agree that you are authorising recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. You can manage recurring payments for select Services in your Microsoft account (https://account.microsoft.com/services). By authorising recurring payments, you are authorising Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, "Electronic Payments"). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment. e. Online Statement and Errors. For all Services other than Skype, Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618284), where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing in to your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide. An invoice with VAT may be made available depending on the Service and country. If we make an error on your bill, we'll correct it promptly after you tell us (or we notice it) and we investigate the charge. We recommend that you tell us within 120 days after an obvious error first appears on your bill as it is easier for us to resolve the issue during that period. You can address your requests for these purposes to the customer support service, as indicated in section 4.e. f. Refund Policy. You will be entitled to a cancellation period (a "Cooling-Off Period") of fourteen (14) days from the day of purchase, with or without cause. If the Service is partly delivered at the time of cancellation, you will get a pro-rated refund. You acknowledge the Cooling-Off Period ends at the time the Service is fully delivered to you, then your purchase cannot be refunded. When you purchase digital content from us, you will cease to have the right to cancel from the moment when you begin the download. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. For all Services other than Skype, information and directions on how to cancel a Service and request a refund using our Withdrawal Form, if you are entitled to a refund, is provided on Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618284). For Skype, please complete the Withdrawal Form using the information provided here (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact Microsoft and we will investigate the charge. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any rights under applicable law. For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283). g. Terminating the Services. You may cancel the Services on the services and subscriptions management page in your Microsoft account (https://account.microsoft.com/) or by contacting customer service as described above in section 4.e. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your Services end at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you cancelled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have cancelled as of the date that the original payment was made and you authorise us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment. h. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period. i. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if you breach the terms and conditions of the offer. j. Price Changes. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the term. You will need to agree to any new offer and price if you want to continue the Services.If your Services are on a periodic basis (for example, monthly), with no specific time length, and isn't a trial offer, we may change the price of the Services if we add new or improved Service features, to the extent the costs of providing the Service have increased accordingly, or in response to market changes (for example, due to labour costs, currency fluctuations, changes in taxes/regulations, inflation, licence fees, infrastructure and administrative costs). We will inform you at least 30 days before the price change becomes effective. You will have the opportunity to cancel the Services before the price changes in accordance with section 9.h above. When we notify you of the price change, we'll also inform you of the reasons and scope of the increase in prices and that the new price will become effective if you don't cancel the Services, and we'll also remind you of how you can cancel the Services. k. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may also reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust it for any previous over-payment. l. Late payments. In case of late payments, you must pay for the reasonable costs we incur to collect any past due amounts including lawyers' fees and other legal fees and costs, as permitted by law and regulations. We may suspend or cancel your Services if you fail to pay in full on time after we send you a reminder - with the threat of suspension and/or cancellation of the Services - to make your payment within an appropriate time. You can avoid suspension or cancellation if you make the required payment within the appropriate time set forth in the reminder. A different procedure will apply if the amount missing is marginal. Amounts missing below 2 per cent of the total invoice value will always be deemed marginal. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in the loss of access to your Microsoft account. m. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype's Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383). n. Bank Account Payment Method. You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g. a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house ("ACH") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area ("SEPA") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the "mandate" in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorised to register and use this bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorise Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorise the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorisation will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorised transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms. 10. Contracting Entity, Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes.If you live in (or, if you are a business, your principal place of business is in) the European Union, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, and you are using cost-free or paid Services, you are contracting with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland (registered at the Companies Registration Office in Ireland under number 256796, VAT registration number: IE 8256796 U, with a registered address of 70 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland). The laws of Ireland govern all claims related to cost-free and paid Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have your habitual residence (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located). With respect to jurisdiction, you and Microsoft agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have your habitual residence (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland. 11. Warranties. If you are a consumer, you have certain rights under the law. These rights include an obligation on Microsoft to provide the Services using reasonable care and skill. Nothing in these terms is intended to limit or exclude our liability for any breach by Microsoft of this and you shall benefit from the legal warranty of conformity and hidden defects under the law of the country to which we direct your Services. Learn more about your statutory rights here (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/aboutwarranties). SUBJECT TO THE WARRANTY ABOVE AND EXCEPT IN CASES IN WHICH WE HAVE HIDDEN DEFECTS IN BAD FAITH OR DEFECTS HAVE RENDERED USE OF THE SERVICES IMPOSSIBLE - AND EXCEPT FOR SKYPE PAID PRODUCTS - WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES "AS IS", "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". WE DON'T GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AREN'T FAULT-FREE AND THAT OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF DOWNTIME OCCUR. WE CAN'T GUARANTEE THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE. WE AND OUR AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND VENDORS GIVE NO CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU HAVE ALL MANDATORY WARRANTIES FORESEEN BY LAW, BUT WE GRANT NO OTHER WARRANTIES. WE EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED MANDATORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 12. Limitation of Liability. a. Microsoft shall not be liable for Your Content, material or other third party material, including links to third-party websites and activities provided by users. Such content and activities are neither attributable to Microsoft nor do they represent Microsoft's opinion. b. Microsoft shall only be liable if material obligations of the Agreement have been violated, or as otherwise required by applicable law. c. Microsoft, its vicarious agents and/or its legal representatives shall not be liable for any indirect damage, including financial loss, such as loss of profit, unless Microsoft, its vicarious agents and/or its legal representative have at least acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct. d. Any statutory no-fault liability of Microsoft, including statutory liability for breach of warranty, shall remain unaffected by the limitation of liability. The same shall apply to liability of Microsoft, its vicarious agents and/or its legal representatives in the event of fraud or their negligence resulting in personal injury or death. e. Microsoft is not responsible or liable for any failure to perform or delay in performing its obligations under these Terms to the extent that the failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond Microsoft's reasonable control (such as labour disputes, acts of God, war or terrorist activity, malicious damage, accidents or compliance with any applicable law or government order). Microsoft will endeavour to minimise the effects of any of these events and to perform the obligations that aren't affected. 13. Service-Specific Terms. The terms before and after section 13 apply generally to all Services. This section contains service-specific terms that are in addition to the general terms. These service-specific terms govern if there are any conflicts with the general terms. a. Xbox. i. Personal Non-Commercial Use. The Xbox online service, Xbox Game Studios games (including Mojang Games) (https://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-studios), applications, subscriptions (e.g. Xbox Game Pass subscription service offerings), services (e.g. Xbox Cloud Gaming) and content provided by Microsoft (collectively, the "Xbox Services") are only for your personal and noncommercial use. ii. Xbox Services.When you sign up to receive Xbox Services, information about your game play, activities and usage of games and Xbox Services will be tracked and shared with applicable third parties, including game developers, in order for Microsoft to deliver the Xbox Services and for the third parties to operate non-Microsoft games and services. If you choose to link your Microsoft Xbox Services account with your account on a non-Microsoft service or sign in to your Xbox Services account to access a non-Microsoft Service (for example, a non-Microsoft game publisher of Third-Party Apps and Services), you agree that: (a) Microsoft may share limited account and usage-related information (including without limitation gamertag, gamer score, game score, game history, usage data and friends list), with that non-Microsoft party as stated in the Microsoft Privacy Statement, and (b) if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, the non-Microsoft party may also have access to Your Content from in-game communications or other applications that you use when you are signed into your account with that non-Microsoft party. Also, if allowed by your Xbox privacy settings, Microsoft can publish your name, gamertag, gamerpic, motto, avatar, gameclips and games that you've played in communications to people you allow. iii. Your Content. As part of building the Xbox Services community, you grant to Microsoft, its affiliates and sublicensees a free and worldwide right, to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, broadcast, share and display Your Content or your name, gamertag, gamerpic, motto or avatar that you posted for any Xbox Services in whole or in part by any means or processes on any materials or support. iv. Game Managers. Some games may use game managers, ambassadors or hosts. Game managers and hosts are not authorised Microsoft spokespersons. Their views do not necessarily reflect those of Microsoft. v. Kids on Xbox. If you are a minor using the Xbox Services, your parent or guardian may have control over many aspects of your account and may receive reports about your use of the Xbox Services. vi. Game Currency or Virtual Goods. The Xbox Services may include a virtual, game currency (like gold, coins or points) that may be purchased from or on behalf of Microsoft using actual monetary instruments if you are a legal adult in your country of residence. The Xbox Services may also include virtual, digital items or goods that may be purchased from or on behalf of Microsoft using actual monetary instruments or using game currency. Game currency and virtual goods may never be redeemed for actual monetary instruments, goods or other items of monetary value from Microsoft or any other party. Other than a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use the game currency and virtual goods in the Xbox Services only, you have no right or title in or to any such game currency or virtual goods associated with any one or more Xbox games or apps appearing or originating in the Xbox Services, or any other attributes associated with use of the Xbox Services or stored within the Xbox Services. Microsoft may change its offerings around game currency or virtual goods from time to time. vii. Software Updates. For any device that can connect to Xbox Services, we may automatically check your version of Xbox console software or the Xbox app software and download Xbox console or Xbox app software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Xbox Services, using unauthorised Xbox games or Xbox apps, or using unauthorised hardware peripheral devices with an Xbox console. viii. Cheating and Tampering Software. For any device that can connect to Xbox Services, we may automatically check your device for unauthorised hardware or software that enables cheating or tampering in violation of the Code of Conduct or these Terms, and download Xbox app software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Xbox Services, or from using unauthorised hardware or software that enables cheating or tampering. ix. Additional Subscription Terms and Conditions. Xbox Services subscriptions are subject to additional terms and conditions set forth in the Xbox Subscriptions Terms & Conditions (https://www.xbox.com/legal/subscription-terms). x. Inactive Xbox Service Subscriptions. Microsoft may turn off your recurring billing and stop recurring charges in select countries if you do not use your Xbox Services subscription for a period of time. Microsoft will provide notice to you before turning off recurring billing. For more information, including the applicable period of inactivity, see Inactivity Policy FAQ (https://support.xbox.com/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/xbox-subscription-inactivity-policy). b. Store."Store" refers to a Service that allows you to browse, download, purchase and rate and review applications (the term "application" includes games) and other digital content. These Terms cover use of certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox). "Office Store" means a Store for Office products and apps for Office, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Access and Project (2013 versions or later) or any other experience that is branded Office Store. "Microsoft Store on Windows" means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates, for Windows devices such as phone, PC and tablet or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and accessible on Windows devices such as phone, PC or tablet. "Microsoft Store on Xbox" means a Store, owned and operated by Microsoft or its affiliates and made available on Xbox consoles or any other experience that is branded Microsoft Store and made available on Xbox console. i. Licence Terms. We will identify the publisher of each application available in the relevant Store. Unless different licence terms are provided with the application, the Standard Application Licence Terms ("SALT") at the end of these Terms are an agreement between you and the application publisher setting forth the licence terms that apply to an application you download through any Store owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (excluding the Office Store). For clarity, these Terms cover the use of, and services provided by, Microsoft Services. Section 5 of these Terms also applies to any Third-Party Apps and Services acquired through a Store. Applications downloaded through the Office Store are not governed by the SALT and have separate licence terms that apply. ii. Updates. Microsoft will automatically check for and download updates to your applications, even if you are not signed into the relevant Store. You can change your Store or system settings if you prefer not to receive automatic updates to Store applications. However, certain Office Store applications that are entirely or partly hosted online may be updated at any time by the application developer and may not require your permission to update. iii. Ratings and Reviews. If you submit a rating or review for an application or other Digital Good in the Store, you may receive email from Microsoft containing content from the publisher of the application or Digital Good. Any such email comes from Microsoft; we do not share your email address with publishers of applications or other Digital Goods you acquire through the Store. iv. Safety Warning. To avoid possible injury, discomfort or eye strain, you should take periodic breaks from use of games or other applications, especially if you feel any pain or fatigue resulting from usage. If you experience discomfort, take a break. Discomfort might include feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain or dry eyes. Using applications can distract you and obstruct your surroundings. Avoid trip hazards, stairs, low ceilings, fragile or valuable items that could be damaged. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures when exposed to certain visual images like flashing lights or patterns that may appear in applications. Even people with no history of seizures may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these seizures. Symptoms may include lightheadedness, altered vision, twitching, jerking or shaking of limbs, disorientation, confusion, loss of consciousness or convulsions. Immediately stop using and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms, or consult a doctor before using the applications if you've ever suffered symptoms linked to seizures. Parents should monitor their children's use of applications for signs of symptoms. c. Microsoft Family Features. Parents and kids can use Microsoft family features, including Microsoft Family Safety, to build trust based on a shared understanding of what behaviour, websites, apps, games, physical locations and spending is right in their family. Parents can create a family by going to https://account.microsoft.com/family (or by following the instructions on their Windows device or Xbox console) and inviting kids or other parents to join. There are many features available to family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you agree to create or join a family and when you purchase Digital Goods for family access. By creating or joining a family, you agree to use the family in accordance with its purpose and won't use it in an unauthorised way to unlawfully gain access to another person's information. d. Group Messaging.Various Microsoft services allow you to send messages to others via voice or SMS ("messages"), and/or allow Microsoft and Microsoft-controlled affiliates to send such messages to you and one or more other users on your behalf. WHEN YOU INSTRUCT MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT-CONTROLLED AFFILIATES TO SEND SUCH MESSAGES TO YOU OR TO OTHERS, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT TO US THAT YOU AND EACH PERSON YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED US TO MESSAGE CONSENT TO RECEIVE SUCH MESSAGES AND ANY OTHER RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE TEXT MESSAGES FROM MICROSOFT AND MICROSOFT-CONTROLLED AFFILIATES. "Administrative text messages" are periodic transactional messages from a particular Microsoft service, including but not limited to a "welcome message" or instructions on how to stop receiving messages. You or group members no longer wishing to receive such messages can opt out of receiving further messages from Microsoft or Microsoft-controlled affiliates at any time by following the instructions provided. If you no longer wish to receive such messages or participate in the group, you agree that you will opt out through the instructions provided by the applicable program or service. If you have reason to believe that a group member no longer wishes to receive such messages or participate in the group, you agree to remove them from the group. You also represent and warrant to us that you and each person you have instructed us to message understands that each group member is responsible for the costs of any message charges assessed by his or her mobile carrier, including any international message charges that may apply when messages are transmitted from US-based numbers. e. Skype, Microsoft Teams and GroupMe. i. Emergency Services. There are important differences between traditional mobile or fixed line telephone services and Skype, Microsoft Teams and GroupMe. Microsoft has limited obligations under applicable local or national rules, regulations or law to offer access to emergency services such as 911 or 112 emergency calling ("Emergency Services") through Skype, Microsoft Teams and GroupMe. ii. Only limited software versions of the Skype to Phone feature of Skype may support calls to Emergency Services in a very limited number of countries and depending on the platform used. You can find details about availability and how to configure this feature here: http://www.skype.com/en/legal/emergency-calling/. If your Skype to Phone emergency call is connected, you will need to provide the details of your physical location to enable the emergency services to respond to you. Microsoft does not guarantee that your emergency call will be connected. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at www.skype.com/go/emergency. iii. Changes to Skype paid products. If we make changes to Skype paid products which are detrimental to you, we'll give you at least thirty days' notice of the changes and inform you of your right to terminate the affected product before it changes. If you do not terminate the product before the changes take effect, you agree to the changes. We will expressly inform you of this fact when we notify you. iv. APIs or Broadcasting. If you want to use Skype in connection with any broadcast, you must comply with the "Broadcast TOS" at https://www.skype.com/go/legal.broadcast. If you want to use any application program interface ("API") exposed or made available by Microsoft you must comply with the applicable licensing terms, which are available at www.skype.com/go/legal. v. Fair Use Policies. Fair usage policies may apply to your use of Skype software and products. Please review these policies which are designed to protect against fraud and abuse and may place limits on the type, duration or volume of calls or messages that you are able to make. These policies are incorporated in these Terms by reference. You can find these policies at https://www.skype.com/go/terms.fairusage. vi. Mapping. Skype software and products contain features that allow you to submit information to, or plot yourself on a map using, a mapping service. By using those features, you agree to these Terms and the Google Maps terms available at https://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/help/terms_maps.html. vii. Personal/Non-Commercial Use. The use of Skype software and products is for your personal and non-commercial use. You are permitted to use Skype at work for your own business communications. viii. Skype Number/Skype To Go. If Microsoft provides you with a Skype Number or Skype To Go number, you agree that you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. In certain countries, a number may be made available to you by a Microsoft partner rather than Microsoft, and you may need to enter into a separate agreement with such partner. For more details on Skype Number see https://go.skype.com/home.skype-number. ix. Skype Manager.A "Skype Manager Admin Account" is created and managed by you, acting as an individual administrator of a Skype Manager group and not as a business entity. You may link your individual Microsoft account to a Skype Manager group ("Linked Account"). You may appoint additional administrators to your Skype Manager subject to their acceptance of these Terms. If you allocate Skype Numbers to a Linked Account, you are responsible for compliance with any requirements related to the residency or location of your Linked Account users. If you choose to unlink a Linked Account from a Skype Manager group, any allocated subscriptions, Skype Credit or Skype Numbers will not be retrievable and Your Content or material associated with the unlinked account will no longer be accessible by you. You agree to process any personal information of your Linked Account users in accordance with all applicable data protection laws. x. Skype Charges and Refunds. The charges payable for calling phones outside of a subscription consist of a connection fee (charged once per call) and a per-minute rate as set out on www.skype.com/go/allrates. Call charges will be deducted from you Skype Credit balance. Microsoft may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers that are not part of a subscription. If the changes are substantial and not advantageous to you (e.g. if we increase the rates), we will inform you by email or in some other appropriate manner at least thirty (30) days before the rate changes take effect. After thirty (30) days, the new rates will apply to your next call. You can find the current rates at www.skype.com/go/allrates. If you do not accept the new rates you should not make a call. Fractional call minutes and fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the next whole unit. All prices for Skype paid products are inclusive of applicable taxes, including VAT, unless otherwise stated. VAT is calculated based on the billing address provided. You explicitly waive any right to VAT reimbursement from Microsoft if the amount of VAT ultimately payable by the latter to the tax authorities would for any reason be lower than the amount of VAT collected from you. Skype paid products are not available to customers in Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Büsingen / Buesingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Livigno, Campione d'Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano. If you have made use of a Skype paid product, your Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded. Expenditure of Skype Credit, allocation of a Skype Number or use of a subscription amounts to 'full delivery' and/or 'use' of a Skype paid product. You expressly agree that Skype Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period and become non-refundable upon allocation. Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only unused or unexpired Skype subscriptions are refundable subject to these Terms. The Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Skype paid products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner, (ii) paid for in cash using third-party payment methods (such as a cash payment wallet), (iii) not directly purchased online from Microsoft (e.g. vouchers or pre-paid cards) or (iv) allocated to your account by a third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may be entitled, under applicable law, to a refund, upon request, of any pre-paid subscription balance in the event you switch your Skype Number to another provider. xi. Skype Credit. Microsoft does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Skype paid products. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180-days, Microsoft will place your Skype Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link at https://www.skype.com/go/store.reactivate.credit. You can enable the Auto Recharge feature when you buy Skype Credit by ticking the appropriate box. If enabled, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by your chosen payment method every time your Skype balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time. If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing and changing your settings in your account portal in Skype. xii. International Message Fees. GroupMe currently uses US-based numbers for each group created. Every text message sent to or received from a GroupMe number will count as an international text message sent to or received from the United States. Depending upon your location, Microsoft Teams may be using a phone number that could count as an international text message.Please check with your provider for the associated international rates. f. Bing and Microsoft Start (including MSN). i. Bing and Microsoft Start Materials.

Microsoft Rewards (the "Programme") enables you to earn redeemable points for activities such as qualified searches, acquisitions and other offers from Microsoft. Offers may vary by market. A search is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user's own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind ("Search"). An acquisition is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a licence for digital content from Microsoft, whether free or paid ("Acquisition"). Rewards points are not offered for every purchase from Microsoft. Microsoft may offer additional opportunities to earn points from time to time, and each points-earning offer will not be available in perpetuity. Your earned points can be redeemed for rewards listed on the redeem page at https://aka.ms/redeemrewards ("Rewards").For more information see the Rewards section at support.microsoft.com (https://support.microsoft.com) ("FAQ"). 1. Programme Requirements. You need a valid Microsoft account and your devices must meet the minimum system requirements (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/). The Programme is open to users who reside in the markets listed in the FAQs. Individuals can have no more than one Programme account, even if an individual has multiple email addresses and households are limited to six accounts. The Programme is solely for your personal and non-commercial use. 2. Points. Except for donating your points to a not-for-profit organisation listed on the redeem page, you cannot transfer points. Points are not your personal property, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis. You cannot purchase points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of points or Rewards per person, per household or over a set period (e.g. a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith. You may redeem no more than 550,000 points per calendar year in the Programme. Points earned in the Programme are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other programme offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed points expire if you do not earn or redeem any points for 18 months. 3. Rewards. You may redeem your points or you may contribute points to a listed nonprofit organisation by visiting the redeem page (https://aka.ms/redeemrewards) or by signing up for automatic contributions to non-profit organisations through a giving programme. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis. You may be required to provide additional information, like your address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or freephone number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem points for Rewards. Once you have ordered a Reward, you cannot cancel it or return it for a refund of points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you order a Reward that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Reward of comparable value or refund your points. Microsoft may update the Rewards offered on the redeem page or discontinue offering specific Rewards. Some Rewards may have age eligibility requirements. Any such requirements will be included in the relevant offer. You are responsible for all federal, state and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Reward. Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards are not for resale. For more information about contributing points automatically to non-profit organisations, see the Give with Bing FAQs (https://www.microsoft.com/rewards/give-mode-overview). 4. Cancelling Your Participation in the Programme. If you no longer wish to participate in the Microsoft Rewards programme, follow the instructions on the opt out page (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false).

Using the Services & Support. a. Microsoft account. You'll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services. Your Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners. i. Creating an Account. You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online. You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account. In some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you. If you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account. Please review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms. You cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity. To protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account. ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don't sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. You must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.

Based on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content. If you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656. iii. Kids and Accounts.

Closing Your Account. 1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, you can choose to put it in a suspended state for either 30 or 60 days just in case you change your mind. After that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during the suspension period will reactivate your Microsoft account. 2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we'll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won't be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you've acquired. b. Work or School Accounts. You can sign into certain Microsoft services with a work or school email address. If you do, you agree that the owner of the domain associated with your email address may be notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised. You further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply. If you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services. c. Additional Equipment/Data Plans. To use many of the Services, you'll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan. You might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone. You are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment. Those fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees. Check with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you. d. Service Notifications. When there's something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we'll send you Service notifications. If you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases. We may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages). Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS. e. Support. Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com. Certain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified. Support may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services. f. Ending your Services. If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends. Second, we'll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). As a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you've stored on those Services). You should have a regular backup plan. Third, you may lose access to products you've acquired. If you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately. 5. Using Third-Party Apps and Services.The Services may allow you to access or acquire products, services, websites, links, content, material, games, skills, integrations, bots or applications from independent third parties (companies or people who aren't Microsoft) ("Third-Party Apps and Services"). Many of our Services also help you find, make requests to, or interact with Third-Party Apps and Services or allow you to share Your Content or Data, and you understand that by using our Services you are directing them to make Third-Party Apps and Services available to you. The Third-Party Apps and Services may allow you to store Your Content or Data with the publisher, provider or operator of the Third-Party Apps and Services. The Third-Party Apps and Services may present you with a privacy policy or require you to accept their terms before you can install or use the Third-Party App or Service. See section 14.b for additional terms for applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to, the Office Store, the Microsoft Store on Xbox and the Microsoft Store on Windows). You should review the third-party terms and privacy policies before acquiring, using, requesting, or linking your Microsoft Account to any Third-Party Apps and Services. Any third-party terms do not modify any of these Terms. You are responsible for your dealings with third parties. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you as part of any Third-Party Apps and Services and is not responsible or liable to you or others for information or services provided by any Third-Party Apps and Services. 6. Service Availability. a. The Services, Third-Party Apps and Services, or material or products offered through the Services may be unavailable from time to time, may be offered for a limited time, or may vary depending on your region or device. If you change the location associated with your Microsoft account, you may need to re-acquire the material or applications that were available to you and paid for in your previous region. b. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Microsoft is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer as a result. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve Your Content or Data that you've stored. We recommend that you regularly backup Your Content and Data that you store on the Services or store using Third-Party Apps and Services. 7. Updates to the Services or Software, and Changes to These Terms. a. We may change these Terms at any time, and we'll tell you when we do. Using the Services after the changes become effective means you agree to the new terms. If you don't agree to the new terms, you must stop using the Services, close your Microsoft account and, if you are a parent or guardian, help your minor child close his or her Microsoft account. b. Sometimes you'll need software updates to keep using the Services. We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes. You may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services. Such updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply. Microsoft isn't obligated to make any updates available and we don't guarantee that we will support the version of the system or device for which you purchased or licensed the software, apps, content or other products. c. Additionally, there may be times when we need to remove or change features or functionality of the Service or stop providing a Service or access to Third-Party Apps and Services altogether. Except to the extent required by applicable law, we have no obligation to provide a re-download or replacement of any material, Digital Goods (defined in section 14.k), or applications previously purchased. We may release the Services or their features in a preview or beta version, which may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work. d. So that you can use material protected with digital rights management (DRM), like some music, games, movies, books and more, DRM software may automatically contact an online rights server and download and install DRM updates. 8. Software License. Unless accompanied by a separate Microsoft license agreement (for example, if you are using a Microsoft application that is included with and a part of Windows, then the Microsoft Software License Terms for the Windows Operating System govern such software), any software provided by us to you as part of the Services is subject to these Terms. Applications acquired through certain Stores owned or operated by Microsoft or its affiliates (including, but not limited to the Office Store, Microsoft Store on Windows and Microsoft Store on Xbox) are subject to section 14.b.i below. a.If you comply with these Terms, we grant you the right to install and use one copy of the software per device on a worldwide basis for use by only one person at a time as part of your use of the Services. For certain devices, such software may be pre-installed for your personal, non-commercial use of the Services. The software or website that is part of the Services may include third-party code. Any third-party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from the software or website, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Microsoft. Notices, if any, for the third-party code are included for your information only. b. The software is licensed, not sold, and Microsoft reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Microsoft, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. This license does not give you any right to, and you may not: i. circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services; ii. disassemble, decompile, decrypt, hack, emulate, exploit, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so; iii. separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices; iv. publish, copy, rent, lease, sell, export, import, distribute, or lend the software or the Services, unless Microsoft expressly authorizes you to do so; v. transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services; vi. use the Services in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else's use of them or gain access to any service, data, account, or network; vii. enable access to the Services or modify any Microsoft-authorized device (e.g., Xbox consoles, Microsoft Surface, etc.) by unauthorized third-party applications. 9. Payment Terms. If you purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them. a. Charges. If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge. The price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise. The price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Taxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered. We may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you. Suspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content. Connecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location. b. Your Billing Account. To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service. You can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount. Additionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions. Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account. c. Billing. By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed. d. Recurring Payments.When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft. You must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services. We will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, "Electronic Payments"). Subscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment. e. Online Statement and Errors. Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement. For Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com). This is the only billing statement that we provide. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate the charge. If you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund. If Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days. f. Refund Policy. Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283). g. Canceling the Services. You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Cancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service. To cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website. You can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286). You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; and (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. We will process your Data as described above in section 4. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled. If you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date that the original payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment. h. Trial-Period Offers. If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period. i. Promotional Offers. From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services. Microsoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer. j. Price Changes. We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term. k. Payments to You. If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment. l. Gift Cards. Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions). Information on Skype gift cards is available on Skype's Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383). m. Bank Account Payment Method. You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method. Eligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house ("ACH") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area ("SEPA") or "iDEAL" in the Netherlands). Terms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the "mandate" in the case of SEPA) also apply. You represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method. By registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits. You understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account. Contact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error. Laws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account. By registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms. 10. Contracting Entity.

Microsoft Rewards. i. Microsoft Rewards (the "Program") enables you to earn redeemable points for activities such as qualified searches, acquisitions, and other offers from Microsoft. Offers may vary by market. A search is the act of an individual user manually entering text for the good faith purpose of obtaining Bing search results for such user's own research purposes and does not include any query entered by a bot, macro, or other automated or fraudulent means of any kind ("Search"). An acquisition is the process of purchasing goods or downloading and acquiring a license for digital content from Microsoft, whether free or paid ("Acquisition"). Rewards points are not offered for every purchase from Microsoft. Microsoft may offer additional opportunities to earn points from time to time, and each points-earning offer will not be available in perpetuity. Your earned points can be redeemed for rewards listed on the redeem page at https://aka.ms/redeemrewards ("Rewards"). For more information see the Rewards section at support.microsoft.com ("FAQ"). 1. Program Requirements. You need a valid Microsoft account and your devices must meet the minimum system requirements (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/). The Program is open to users who reside in the markets listed in the FAQ. Individuals can have no more than one Program account, even if an individual has multiple email addresses, and households are limited to six accounts. The Program is solely for your personal and noncommercial use. 2. Points. Except for sharing points within your Microsoft family (limits may apply) or donating your points to a nonprofit organization listed on the redeem page, you cannot transfer points. Points are not your personal property, and you may not obtain any cash or money in exchange for them. Points are awarded to you on a promotional basis. You cannot purchase points. Microsoft may limit the quantity of points or Rewards per person, per household, or over a set period (e.g., a day) provided that you are not disadvantaged in breach of good faith. You may redeem no more than 550,000 points per calendar year in the Program. Points earned in the Program are not valid in, and may not be used in combination with, any other program offered by Microsoft or third parties. Unredeemed points expire if you do not earn or redeem any points for 18 months. 3. Rewards. You may redeem your points or you may contribute points to a listed nonprofit organization by visiting the redeem page (https://aka.ms/redeemrewards) or by signing up for automatic contributions to non-profit organizations through a giving program. There may be a limited number of a particular Reward available, and those Rewards will be delivered on a first-come, first-served basis.You may be required to provide additional information, like your mailing address and a telephone number (other than a VOIP or toll-free number), and you may also be asked to enter a fraud-prevention code or sign additional legal documents to redeem points for Rewards. Once you order a Reward, you cannot cancel it or return it for a refund of points except in the case of defective products or as required by applicable law. If you order a Reward that is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons, we may substitute a Reward of comparable value or refund your points. Microsoft may update the Rewards offered on the redeem page or discontinue offering specific Rewards. Some Rewards may have age eligibility requirements. Any such requirements will be included in the relevant offer. You are responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes and any other costs of accepting and using the Reward. Rewards will be emailed to the email address associated with your Microsoft account, so keep your email address up to date. Rewards that are undeliverable will not be reissued and are therefore forfeited. Rewards are not for resale. For more information about contributing points automatically to non-profit organizations, see the Give with Bing FAQs (https://www.microsoft.com/rewards/give-mode-overview). 4. Cancelling Your Participation in the Program. If you no longer wish to participate in the Microsoft Rewards program, follow the instructions on the opt out page (https://account.microsoft.com/rewards/optout?confirm=false). If you opt out, you will immediately lose all of your available points. Your Program account may be cancelled if you do not log in at least once in an 18-month period. Additionally, Microsoft reserves the right to cancel the Program account of a specific user for tampering with, abusing, or defrauding the Program, or for breach of these terms. Upon Program cancellation (by you or us) or if the Program is suspended, you will have 90 days to redeem your points; otherwise, those points will be forfeited. At the point of cancellation, your right to use the Program and accrue future points ends. 5. Other Conditions. Microsoft reserves the right to disqualify you; disable your access to the Program or your Rewards account; and/or withhold points, Rewards and charitable contributions, if Microsoft believes you are tampering with or abusing any aspect of the Program, ineligible to receive a Reward for legal reasons (such as export laws), or may be engaging in activities that violate these Terms. m. Azure.

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or, If a Business, Your Principal Place of Business Is In) the United States. We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can't, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator's decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren't allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. "We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft, Skype (see section 10) and Microsoft's affiliates. a. Disputes Covered-Everything Except IP. The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services' or software's price, your Microsoft account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors', our, or our licensors' intellectual property rights. b. Mail a Notice of Dispute First. If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can't resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A.. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499. We'll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved. c. Small Claims Court Option.Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court if you meet the court's requirements in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A.. d. Arbitration Procedure. The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, submit the form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business-King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim. But a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity. e. Arbitration Fees and Payments. i. Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less. We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses. If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator's decision (called an "award"), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney's fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. ii. Disputes Involving More than $75,000. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses. f. Conflict with AAA Rules. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. g. Must File Within One Year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes-see section 15.a) within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it's permanently barred. h. Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply. i. Severability. If any part of section 15 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class-wide or representative arbitration, section 15 will be unenforceable in its entirety. 16. Miscellaneous. This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of these Terms), 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18 and those that by their terms apply after the Terms end will survive any termination or cancellation of these Terms. We may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Services. This is the entire agreement between you and Microsoft for your use of the Services. It supersedes any prior agreements between you and Microsoft regarding your use of the Services. All parts of these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law. If a court or arbitrator holds that we can't enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms won't change. Section 15.i says what happens if parts of section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable. Section 15.i prevails over this section if inconsistent with it. Except for section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit; they aren't for the benefit of any other person, except for Microsoft's successors and assigns. 17. Export Laws.You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software and/or Services, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use.

Please review any additional terms and conditions provided to you by the third party. Microsoft has no responsibility with respect to these additional terms. If you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your company or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.

Terms that you agree to when you add your bank account as a payment method to your Microsoft account (for example, the SEPA "mandate") also apply.
