USE OF THE Wii NETWORK SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THIS MEANS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE Wii NETWORK SERVICE WILL ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY. THIS ALSO MEANS WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE Wii NETWORK SERVICE, CONTENT OR PRODUCTS WILL BE FREE FROM VIRUSES, HACKS, OR OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL INTRUSIONS. PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW SUCH WARRANTY LIMITATIONS, SO THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. PLEASE SEE THE Wii OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR ANY WARRANTIES THAT APPLY TO THE Wii CONSOLE. Article 9: Limitation on Claims If you think you have a claim against us related to the Wii Console or the Wii Network Service, you must take legal action within one year after the date of the alleged incident. After the one-year period expires, you may never raise that claim. Article 10: Change, Suspension or Discontinuance of Wii Network Service We may change, suspend, or discontinue the Wii Network Service, or any feature or aspect of the Wii Network Service, at any time, with or without notice to you, and without liability to us. This includes, but is not limited to, the availability of all or any portion of the Wii Network Service, Content, Products, Points, and the number of Points required to redeem particular Content or Products. Article 11: Limited Responsibilities and Indemnification You agree to waive any and all rights to claim damages or losses caused to you or relating to your inability to use the Wii Network Service (or to anyone else using the Wii Network Service through your Wii Console). You understand you might never be fully compensated for that damage or loss if we or one of our licensees, licensors or suppliers (collectively referred to in this Article 11 as “we” or “us”) somehow harm you. This is because we limit our liability to you (and to others) in several ways: Your ability to recover damages or losses from us is limited: you may recover only direct damages, up to the total amount you have ever paid for Points. Generally, direct damages are losses you (or anyone else) suffer as the immediate result of something someone has done wrong. You may not recover any other types of damages, no matter the reason. For example, sometimes a court will award a special amount of damages to punish the person at fault, or, a person might have to pay for damages where the person did not directly cause harm. You agree that we will never have to pay punitive, special, consequential, or incidental damages to you. We are also not liable to anyone else, or for the actions or inactions of anyone else. For example, if your friend is somehow harmed using the Wii Network Service or the Wii Console, we are not responsible to you, your friend, or anyone else. If another person somehow harms you while using your Wii Console or Wii Network Service, we are not liable to you for that other person’s actions. These limitations on liability apply to all matters relating to the Wii Network Service and the Wii Console, including your use of the Wii Network Service and your use of Content or Products that do not specify other limitations on liability. These limitations also apply to any legal or equitable theory, including but not limited to breach of contract, breach of warranty, strict liability, negligence, or other tort. Please note, however, that some states or provinces do not permit certain limitations like these, so these limits on other damages may not fully apply to you. If you breach this agreement, and we or another company or person is harmed by your breach, then you must indemnify us (and our licensees, licensors, and suppliers and any of our employees) from all of the losses and costs related to your breach, including our attorneys’ fees. You must also indemnify us for any claims relating to Third-Party Data modified, created, or sent by you. Article 12: Expiration and Termination of Agreement You may cancel your Wii Shop Account by contacting our customer-service department or by following the instructions in the Wii Shop. If your Wii Shop Account is canceled or terminated for any reason, you will no longer be able to use the Wii Shop.You will lose all downloaded Content and forfeit any rights to any unused Points, which become our property. You may terminate this agreement by removing Content from your Wii Console, discontinuing use of the Wii Network Service, and forfeiting any rights to Points in your Wii Shop Account, which become our property. We may terminate this agreement, or any portion thereof, at any time, for any reason whatsoever. Such termination will void any licenses granted in accordance with this agreement and may prevent your use of the Wii Network Service. We have no obligation to return or refund Points to you, even if the agreement ends. In the event this agreement is terminated or canceled, the following sections will remain in effect: Unauthorized Software, Services, or Devices or Unlicensed Accessories; Credit-Card Charges and Your Billing Account; Intellectual Property; Hosting, Intercepting, Emulating, and Reverse-Engineering Prohibited; Submissions; Warranties; Limitation on Claims; Limited Responsibilities and Indemnification; Expiration and Termination of Agreement; Governing Law, Legal Jurisdiction, and Interpretation of Agreement.

Web beacons are invisible to you because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or e-mail message. We may use Web beacons to collect non-personal information such as the Wii Console IP address, the URL of the page the Web user comes from, and the time the Web beacon is activated (such as when you view the Web page, advertisement, or e-mail containing the Web beacon).

We may use information collected by cookies, as well as other tools such as log files or Web beacons, for determining how to improve the Wii Network Service by seeing which areas, features, and products are most popular; personalizing the services and making recommendations based on downloaded products; and completing transactions you have requested. In the event you visit a third party’s website through the Internet browser option offered on the Wii Network Service, or we employ a third party advertising company to display ads on the Wii Network Service, those websites or ads may also contain cookies. Any information gathered through such cookies is collected by the third party, not by us, and we have no access to or control over these cookies or the information contained within them. Other: In order to constantly improve the products and services we provide and better meet your needs, we may also use your Personal Information as well as anonymous information for our internal marketing, demographic studies, and quality assurance.

If we combine information collected offline with information collected through the Wii Network Service, the combined information will be treated in accordance with this Wii Privacy Policy.
