Foursquare Privacy Policy Consumer Services Privacy Policy Last Updated: March 07, 2023 English | Korean ( Foursquare’s Privacy Policy for Consumer Services explains how Foursquare collects, uses and shares your personal data. This Privacy Policy applies globally to all applications, websites, and other online services offered by Foursquare and our affiliates (collectively “Consumer Services”). Please see our Developer & Enterprise Services Privacy Policy for details about our information practices related to our Developer & Enterprise Services. About Location Data “Location Data” is a type of personal data that, when collected and used responsibly, can help you navigate and interact with the physical and digital worlds around you. Location data is collected using various technologies such as the location services of your operating system or browser, sensor data from your device, and other data that may help us understand your precise location. Ever type in a business name into Uber, or tag your location in a photo before sharing on Twitter? Or, have you ever received a notification for a coupon when you’re passing by your favorite fast food joint? Foursquare powers these features as well as others that help people navigate, explore, and enjoy the world around them.Most importantly, location data should only be collected when you say it is okay to do so, and you should be able to change your mind at any time. The collection of location data should also benefit you, the user. That’s why we only allow partners to use our location technology if they can demonstrate that the use of our technology is necessary to offer benefits or provide value to consumers who opt-in to sharing their location data. You can visit Our Privacy Stance to learn more about our position on important privacy matters. You can control the collection of location data at any time through your device settings. While the exact settings may differ depending on your device, typically, you will be given options that range from never sharing, to being asked to share each time you open an app, to only sharing while using an app, to always sharing. When location data settings are set to “always” (i.e., persistent background location is turned “on”), your device’s location data will be shared with us even if you are not actively using our apps or other Consumer Services.Foursquare is also a participating member of the Network Advertising Initiative’s Precise Location Solution Provider Enhanced Standards which, among other things, requires that participating members not use, allow the use of, sell, or share any information about device or user activity correlated to a known Sensitive Points of Interest, including: – Places of religious worship;– Correctional facilities;– Places that may be used to infer an LGBTQ+ identification;– Places that may be used to infer engagement with explicit sexual content, material, or acts;– Places primarily intended to be occupied by children under 16;– Domestic abuse shelters, including rape crisis centers;– Welfare or homeless shelters and halfway houses;– Dependency or addiction treatment centers;– Medical facilities that cater predominantly to sensitive conditions, such as cancer centers, HIV/AIDS, fertility or abortion clinics, mental health treatment facilities, or emergency room trauma centers;– Places that may be used to infer refugee or immigrant status, such as refugee or immigration centers and immigration services;– Credit repair, debt services, bankruptcy services, or payday lending institutions;– Temporary places of assembly such as political rallies, marches, or protests, during the times that such rallies, marches, or protests take place;– Military Bases Commitment to Accountability Foursquare participates in the following organizations and programs: Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).

These product and service offerings include the following: - When you opt-in to the collection and sharing of geolocation data from your mobile device, we use that data to create an inferred visit to a public location, which we call a "Visit." While Visits are associated with a mobile advertising identifier (or other identifier), to protect your privacy, we do not share your latitude and longitude coordinates, and we do not share inferred home and work locations. - We also help brands measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns by attributing purchases or other actions, such as a store visit, to their advertising by matching ad views to the data. As part of Attribution, we may also associate devices that we believe are related to each other. Audiences (Segments) - Using our Visits, along with inferences about your interests, location and other demographics that we derive from the data we have about you, including associated devices, we create "Audiences." Audiences are then used to send you advertisements tailored to your interests.
