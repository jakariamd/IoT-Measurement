The final day of this year's Global Forum meeting was jointly held with the Task Force on Tax and Development. Public consultation meeting held on 19 May 2014 • WP6 discussions from 20-23 May 2014 Status Consensus in WP6 that the new approach will greatly improve the access for governments to relevant information for transfer pricing purposes Agreement on a three tier approach (CbC template, Masterfile and Local File) As these are new tools, experience needs to be developed to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the tools. WP6 is uniformly of the view that a monitoring mechanism is needed to assess whether the focus of the mechanism can or should be improved in the future There is also broad recognition within WP6 that a structured and careful implementation is necessary to guarantee: consistency in the approaches by governments that the relevant information is available to governments for which it is relevant on a timely basis that commercially sensitive information is treated confidentially that the costs for both taxpayers and tax administrations are balanced to secure that the information is used as intended • WP6 will finalise the document shortly. After that it will be sent to CFA for formal approval THE MULTILATERAL INSTRUMENT Multilateral Instrument • Focus is on feasibility of use of a multilateral instrument • To address treaty-based BEPS issues efficiently while respecting sovereign autonomy in tax matters and preventing uncertainty • Multilateral Instrument is not only feasible but also desirable (numerous benefits, also for developing countries) • Targeted instrument that coexists with bilateral tax treaties • Negotiation through an International Conference and ratification pursuant to national laws • Report and technical annex to the G20 Finance Ministers in September 2014 NEXT STEPS Next Steps  Internal • Working Party 11 (May 2014) • Task Force on Digital Economy (May 2014) • Working Party 2 (June 2014) • Committee on Fiscal Affairs (June 2014)  External • G20 Cairns Finance Ministers (September 2014) • G20 Leaders Brisbane Meeting (November 2014) JOIN THE DISCUSSION Join the discussion Ask questions and comment Directly: Enter your question in the space provided Via email: CTP.BEPS@oecd.org Via Twitter: Send a tweet with the hashtag #BEPS Further Information Website: www.oecd.org/tax/beps.htm Contact: CTP.BEPS@oecd.org Tax email alerts: www.oecd.org/oecddirect
