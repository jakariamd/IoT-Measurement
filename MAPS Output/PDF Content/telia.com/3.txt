The purpose of this CPS is to describe the procedures that the CA uses when issuing certificates, and that all Registration Authorities, Subscribers, Subjects, and Relying Parties shall follow in connection with these certificates. This document defines the Certification Practice Statement for the following CAs - TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 and TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 - TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 and TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 - TeliaSonera Class 3 CA v1 (reservation for future use) - TeliaSonera Email CA v3 and TeliaSonera Email CA v4 This CPS describes the procedures and routines which apply when completing a certificate for individuals, organizations, functions and devices and for revoking and revocation checking of such certificates. This CPS will refer to separate Telia Company Production CPS, which describes the premises, procedures and routines which apply for the Production of Telia Company CA Services. This CPS generally conforms to the IETF PKIX Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement Framework (also known as RFC 3647). This document is divided into nine sections:  Section 1 - provides an overview of the policy and set of provisions, as well as the types of entities and the appropriate applications for certificates.  Section 2 - contains any applicable provisions regarding identification of the entity or entities that operate repositories; responsibility of a PKI participant to publish information regarding its practices, certificates, and the current status; frequency of publication; and access control on published information.  Section 3 - covers the identification and authentication requirements for certificate related activity.  Section 4 - deals with certificate life-cycle management and operational requirements including application for a certificate, revocation, suspension, audit, archival and compromise.  Section 5 - covers facility, management and operational controls (physical and procedural security requirements).  Section 6 - provides the technical controls with regard to cryptographic key requirements.  Section 7 - defines requirements for certificate, Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) formats. This includes information on profiles, versions, and extensions used.  Section 8 - addresses topics covered and methodology used for assessments/audits; frequency of compliance audits or assessments; identity and/or qualifications of the personnel performing the audit or assessment; actions taken as a result of deficiencies found during the assessment; and who is entitled to see results of an assessment.  Section 9 - covers general business and legal matters: the business issues of fees, liabilities, obligations, legal requirements, governing laws, processes, and confidentiality. 1.2 Document name and identification This CPS is titled Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS and the CPS name of this CPS is {TELIACOMPANY-ORGANIZATIONAL-USER-CPS-1}. This CPS is also a Certificate Policy for Telia Company organizational person certificates. The certificates issued according to this CPS contain Certificate policy object identifier corresponding to the applicable certificate type. The routines and roles resulting from this CPS apply only in connection with certificates referring to the following Certificate policy object identifiers: Copyright © Telia Company Page 8 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 Certificate type Issuing CA Hash Certificate policy object identifier User certificates for corporate Customers (Finnish RA) User certificates for corporate Customers (Swedish RA) Email certificates for Telia Company Group TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 SHA1 1.3.6.1.4.1.271.2.3.1.1.11 TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 SHA2 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 SHA1 1.3.6.1.4.1.271.2.3.1.1.12 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 SHA2 TeliaSonera Email CA v3 SHA1 1.3.6.1.4.1.271.2.3.1.1.12 TeliaSonera Email CA v4 SHA2 This CPS also refers to the Telia Company Production CPS with the name {TELIACOMPANY- PRODUCTION-CPS-2}. 1.3 PKI participants Telia Company will issue certificates mainly to Customers of Telia Company but also to Telia Company employees. All of the participating organizations shall undertake what is stated in this Certification Practice Statement and the related Certificate Policies. 1.3.1 Certification authorities The Certification Authority operating in compliance with this Certification Practice Statement is Telia Company. The name of the Certification Authority in the "Issuer" field of the certificate is alternatively: - TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 & TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 - TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 & TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 - TeliaSonera Email CA v3 & TeliaSonera Email CA v4 These CAs are subordinate CAs of TeliaSonera Root CA v1. TeliaSonera Root CA has its own CPS describing the management of the certificate life cycle of subordinate CA certificates signed by it. The title of that CPS is TeliaSonera Root CPS and its CPS name is {TELIASONERA-ROOT-CPS-2}. The Certification Authorities are responsible for managing the certificate life cycle of end entity certificates signed by the CAs. This will include: creating and signing of certificates binding Subjects with their public key  promulgating certificate status through CRLs and/or OCSP responders creating, storing and recovering end entity confidential key pairs for organizations using the Telia Company key backup/restore service 1.3.2 Registration authorities The CA's units authorized to perform registration functions, Customer Organizations acting as Customers of certification services and authorized by CA, or other organizations selected and authorized as RAs, with which the CA makes written agreements, can act as Registration Authorities.

Subject name information may also be contained in the Subject Alternative Name X.509 version 3 extensions. Subject Alternative Name extension may contain following information: Attribute Description of value Copyright © Telia Company Page 15 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 rfc822Name E-mail address of the Subject otherName dNSName Other Name field can be used for Microsoft Windows user principal name (UPN) in the certificates issued to natural persons. dNSName field may contain one or more DNS domain names of the Device. iPAddress iPAddress field may contain one or more IP addresses of the Device. Additional Distinguished Name (DN) and Subject Alternative Name attributes may be used as necessary if they are verified by CA. 3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful Names will be meaningful as stated in the section 3.1.1. 3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers The commonName attribute can include the name, or a pseudonym, of the Subject. OrganizationName attribute contains always a Customer organization's name that accurately identifies the customer. 3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms The commonName (CN) attribute contains the name of the Subject in the following forms: The commonName is composed of the username or similar used by the Customer Organization to identify users or devices in the VPN or other service that the certificates are used for. The commonName is composed of the given and family name of the Subject, and it can additionally contain other given names or initials. If the certificate is issued to a group email account or similar, then the commonName should be the name of the related function or organizational unit. TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 TeliaSonera Email CA v3 TeliaSonera Email CA v4 The Organization (O) attribute states the Customer Organization in relation to which the Subject is identified. Normally Organization attribute contains the registered name of the Organization with or without the abbreviation for the form of company incorporation. In some cases, the CA may also accept an Organization name attribute that is other than the official registered name of the Organization, if the name is commonly used or there is otherwise no risk of confusion. 3.1.5 Uniqueness of names The Subject name stated in a certificate will be unique for all certificates issued within the domain of the CA, and conform to X.500 standards for name uniqueness. Subject name uniqueness means that the CA will not issue certificates with identical names to different entities. However, the CA may issue several certificates to the same entity, and in that case the Subject names in those certificates may be the same. Unambiguousness of the Subject names is secured in a two-phased procedure. A name contains both the name of the organization and the name of the Subject. The CA system allows only unambiguous organization names. The Customer Organization is not able to change the organization name that the CA has recorded for the organization in the CA system. The Customer Organizations are responsible for the unambiguousness of the names of their own users and devices. Copyright © Telia Company Page 16 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks The priority to entity names are given to registered trademark holders. The use of a Domain Name is restricted to the authenticated legal owner of that Domain Name. The use of an email address is restricted to the authenticated legal owner of that email address. Telia Company does not otherwise check the right of the Customer Organization to use the names it gives in its certificate applications except for the Organization Name as stated in section 3.2.2, nor does the CA participate in any name claim dispute resolution procedures concerning brand names, domain names, trademarks, or service names. Telia Company reserves the right not to issue such a certificate, or to revoke a certificate that has already been issued, when there is a name claim dispute involved concerning the certificate contents. 3.2 Initial identity validation 3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key If the CA does not generate the key pair of the Subject but it is generated in the Customer Organization, the CA can verify the possession of the private key by verifying the electronic signature included in the certificate request. 3.2.2 Authentication of organization identity Telia Company verifies the organization name of a new Customer Organization by checking the existence of the company. Its legal name, business identity code and other relevant organization information are confirmed from an official business register maintained by an applicable government agency (e.g. ytj.fi in Finland) or by using another trustworthy method. Common variations, tradenames, abbreviations or suffixes for the name are allowed provided that the new name can be clearly associated with the Customer Organization. 3.2.3 Authentication of individual identity The Customer Organization can make an agreement with Telia Company to act as a Registration Officer within the Customer Organization and to register Telia Company certificates for the persons or client devices related to the organization. The Customer Registration Officer is restricted to register certificates only within their own Organizations (O). Before enabling the service, the CA verifies the organization identity as described in the section 3.2.2. The procedures to authenticate the identity of the Subject vary between the different Telia Company certificate services: TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 Telia Company or Customer Registration Officer is responsible for authenticating the Subject data according to Organization's internal policies. Subject authentication is typically based on a previously recorded ownership of Customer's email address, device or mobile phone number. If Common Name or dnsName field of Subject Alternative Name includes public domain names, Telia Company verifies that Customer Organization has right to use them by checking the ownership from the official records (e.g. domain.fi (.fi), iis.se (.se) or www.networksolutions.com/whois- search). A written permission from the registered legal owner is an alternative. Telia Company verifies the ownership of an email address by sending a one-time-password to the applied email-address. Then the Subject entity must use the password within limited time frame to prove the access to the email-address. In Enterprise RA cases email-address can be taken from reliable internal source of the Subscriber without additional verification by one-time-password. If CA API connection is used CA will pre-approve all allowed domain names and O values that can be used in Customer Subject data. Copyright © Telia Company Page 17 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 Customer or Telia Company Registration Officer is responsible for authenticating the Subject. The Registration Officers are obliged to follow the policies and instructions given by the CA. The Registration Officer should use Organization's previously recorded directories, databases or other similar information on Organization's employees, partners or devices to verify the Subject information including the email address, Or the Registration Officer should verify the information by checking the Subject's identity card. TeliaSonera Email CA v3 TeliaSonera Email CA v4 Certificates are issued to employees within the Telia Company Group and individuals contracted by Telia Company. The Subscriber is authenticated using a username and password and information stored in Telia Company's directories or databases. 3.2.4 Non-verified subscriber information Domain name ownership of domains in email addresses is not verified by Telia Company except when CA API is utilized by the Customer. Telia Company verifies only the following Subject information: TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 Telia Company verifies Organization Name, email address ownership and public domain name information as described in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3. The Customer Registration Officer is responsible for verifying the other subject information according to Customer's internal policy. Telia Company does not verify other information within the certificate request. Telia Company verifies Organization Name (O) information as described in section 3.2.2. Customer or Telia Company Registration Officer is required to verify the following Subject information as described in section 3.2.3: commonName (CN) If email address (EA), Surname (S) and givenName (G) attributes or Subject Alternative Name extensions are used then the Registration Officer should verify them also. Other information is not verified by Telia Company or Customer Organization. Telia Company verifies the following Subject information as described in section 3.2.3: commonName (CN) emailAddress (EA) serialNumber (SN) - Organization Name (O) TeliaSonera Email CA v3 TeliaSonera Email CA v4 Telia Company does not use other subscriber information within the certificate request. 3.2.5 Validation of authority TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 1 CA v2 The Administrative Contact Person, who grants the necessary authorizations in the Customer Organization, has been identified in the service agreement or order or in Appendix of them. In most cases Telia Company validates the initial authority by calling the contact person via the verified Customer's PBX number or by making a call to some other verified Copyright © Telia Company Page 18 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v1 TeliaSonera Class 2 CA v2 number in the organization, which is looked up from a directory maintained by a trusted party. Role of Administrative Contact person can be re- validated later by Telia Company using the same method if the originally validated persons are unavailable or not known. Initially authorized Administrative Contact Person may authorize new Administrative contact persons or Registration Officers by delivering to Telia Company an authorization in writing or by email. In certain services he/she can do this by authenticating to the self-service tool provided by Telia Company and using it for authorizations. All authenticated administrative Contact persons can use the self-service tool or order process to check or modify authorizations within the Customer. When registering Subjects, the identity and authority of the Registration Officer is verified by means of his certificate issued by Telia Company, or from his signature on the certificate order form, or using other comparable methods approved by the CA. Registration system verifies from Telia Company's internal directories that the subscriber is a current employee within the Telia Company Group or an individual contracted by Telia Company. TeliaSonera Email CA v3 TeliaSonera Email CA v4 3.2.6 Criteria for interoperation Not applicable. 3.3 Identification and authentication for re-key requests 3.3.1 Identification and authentication for routine re-key Re-keying request can be automatically accepted without strong authentication if the subject information remain the same (e.g. one-time-password can be sent to the same mobile phone and/or email address again to re-new the subject's existing certificate). If there are changes in the Subject or certificate delivery information the request will be validated in the same way as at initial registration. Identification and authentication for re-key after revocation 3.3.2 In accordance with 3.3.1. 3.4 Identification and authentication for revocation request Revocation by Customer Organization Customer's self-service revocation can be activated by the Subject or the Subscriber. The revocation request can be submitted to Telia Company by the Subject directly or via the Revocation Officer of the Customer Organization. In the latter case The Revocation Officer is responsible for the verification of the authenticity of the request. Telia Company verifies the identity of the Subject or the Revocation Officer with a certificate, one-time-password scheme or other reliable method. Revocation by the Revocation Service of the CA The Subject, or Subscriber, or Registration Officer in a Customer Organization shall submit a request for certificate revocation to the Revocation Service by telephone or by e-mail. The source of the revocation request will be authenticated based on the digital signature or the Revocation Service will make a call back to the Customer Organization and asks certain detailed data. This data is compared with the information recorded about the Subject at registration, and if necessary, with information in Copyright © Telia Company Page 19 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 the agreements made with the Subscriber or with the Customer Organization. If the data match the certificate will be revoked. In certain situations where there is an identified risk of abuse of the private key or when it is obvious that the authorized use of the key is prevented, it may be necessary to revoke the certificate on request of someone else but the above mentioned entities. In that case the verification of the authenticity of the revocation request can require other authentication methods. In cases where reliable verification cannot be immediately performed, the CA may revoke the certificate to reduce risks. Reinstatement of suspended certificate Customer Registration Officers may reinstate suspended certificates in their own organizations if there is such service agreement with CA. Reinstatement of a suspended certificate can be requested by the Subject or by the Registration Officer operating in the Customer Organization. A request from the Subject will be executed only after confirmation from the Registration Officer. A request or confirmation received from the Registration Officer in an e-mail message or in an electronic form will be verified based on an electronic signature, or the Registration Officer shall be authenticated using certificates, some other strong authentication or by making a call back to the Customer Organization and asking and checking data recorded of the Subject or Registration Officer at registration, or checking information that can be found in the agreements made with the Subscriber or Customer Organization. 4 CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 4.1 Certificate Application 4.1.1 Who can submit a certificate application When a certificate is applied to a person or Device, it is required that the ordering organization is Telia Company's Customer Organization with which the Subject has a contractual relation or which possesses the Device to which the certificate is applied.

The Subject uses the one-time- password to authenticate to the registration tool. The Registration Officer or the Subject generates the key pair and submits the certificate request to the CA system containing the certificate information defined by the Registration Officer during the pre-registration and the public key. b) The Subject initiates the enrollment process by submitting a certificate application using self service software provided by Telia Company. The Subject generates the key pair using browser software and submits the certificate request containing the certificate information. The Registration Officer in the Customer Organization verifies the information in the request and sends the Subject a link to pick up the issued certificate. c) Certificate is applied for through the RA office of the CA. The Registration Officer or Administrative contact person sends a manually or electronically signed order that contains the necessary information for the certificate there. At the RA office of the CA the signature is checked, the sufficiency of information given for the certificate is examined, and the Subject is pre-registered.

TeliaSonera Class 1, Class 2 and E-mail certificates The CA has granted special authorities to a few of its employees to apply for test certificates for tests that must be carried out in the production system. The applicant of a certificate is authenticated on the basis of his certificate. One of the following details in the contents of the "Subject" field of a certificate will serve as an indication of a test certificate: the word "Test" or "Testi" comprises the contents of the "Organization Name" field (the primary method), the "Common Name" field contains the word "test", or another field contains the word "test". A test certificate is valid at most seven (7) days or it shall always be revoked after seven (7) days of its coming into force, at the latest. If such a test case emerges where the contents of the certificate cannot indicate the test nature of the certificate, it must be revoked immediately after the test. The CA has granted a few of its employees special authorities to apply for certificates in the pilot phase of information security services of Sonera, when the registration responsibilities have not yet been moved to the RA office of the CA. The applicant of a pilot certificate is authenticated on the basis of his certificate.

A certificate cannot be reasonably relied on if the Relying Party does not diligently follow the certificate status checking procedures denoted below: - A Relying Party shall ensure him-/herself of the authenticity and integrity of the CRLs or on-line certificate status responses by checking the digital signature and the certification path related to it. The Relying Party shall also check the validity period of the CRL and OCSP response in order to make sure that the information in the CRL or OCSP response is up-to-date. - Certificates may be stored locally in the Relying Party's system, but the prevailing revocation status of each of those certificates shall be checked before use. If valid certificate status information cannot be obtained because of a system or service failure, not a single certificate must be trusted. The acceptance of a certificate in violation of this condition befalls at the Relying Party's own risk. The Relying Party may acquire the checking of the CRLs as a service that shall follow the certificate status checking procedures denoted above. 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency The Revocation Status Service is implemented by publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), digitally signed by the CA, in a public directory. The rules below are followed: - A new CRL is published in the directory at intervals of not more than 2 hours. The validity time of every CRL is forty-eight (48) hours.

Normally latency will be a matter of seconds. 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability Telia Company may provide on-line revocation status checking via the OCSP protocol. The service is only accessible provided that the relying party has an agreement with Telia Company. Availability of the service will be provided in the agreement. 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements In general all OCSP requests will be signed. All responses will be signed by a private key corresponding to a public key certified by the CA on which the OCSP request is made. A separate key pair will be used for the responses of each CA. The OCSP service is normally updated through the use of CRLs and/or deltaCRLs that are published on regular basis. The actual time intervals for the updates of the CRLs and/or deltaCRLs are described in the section 4.9.7. OCSP service may use online checking from CA database provided that the relying party has such agreement with Telia Company. 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available No stipulation. 4.9.12 Special requirements regarding key compromise No stipulation. 4.9.13 Circumstances for suspension For some services certificates are suspended (i.e. cancelled for the time being) by default instead of immediately permanently revoking them.

A Subscriber's confidentiality private keys will be not be escrowed but Telia Company may keep a backup of the keys if so agreed between Telia Company and the Customer. The keys are protected in an encrypted form and are protected in a level no lower than stipulated for the primary versions of the keys. The decryption key used to decrypt the key backups is stored in a HSM and the key backups are saved for a period that is agreed with the Customer. A private key may be recovered for two separate reasons: a) The hard disc, the Smart Card or equivalent that holds the Subscriber's private key is corrupted and the Subscriber needs to make a recovery of his key. The process of authenticating the Subscriber is the same as at the initial certificate issuance. When a private key is recovered the certificate for the corresponding public key is automatically revoked, a new key pair is created and a new certificate is issued. b) The Subscriber is for some reason prevented from using his private key (the Subscriber may for instance be deceased, injured or has left the organization) and the Subscriber's organization needs to decrypt data encrypted by the Subscriber. The process of such a key recovery involves Copyright © Telia Company Page 27 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 at least three persons from the Subscribers' organization where all are authenticated by certificates. When a private key is recovered the certificate for the corresponding public key is automatically revoked. 4.12.2 Session key encapsulation and recovery policy and practices No stipulation. 5 FACILITY, MANAGEMENT, AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS All stipulations regarding chapter 5 Facility Management, and Operational Control are specified in "Telia Company Production CPS". Copyright © Telia Company Page 28 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 6 TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS All general stipulations regarding chapter 6 Technical Security Controls are specified in Telia Company Production CPS.

The Subscriber normally generates the key pair using browser software. The Subscriber may also generate the key pair on a Smart Card or USB token. It is also possible use Smart Cards that have the key pair generated by the Card Manufacturer. If the key pair is generated by the Subscriber in a Customer Organization, the Customer Organization itself is responsible for the secure generation of the key pair and the confidentiality of the private key. If the key pair is provided by the CA, the generation will be carried out according to the secure procedures defined by the CA. 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber The CA delivers the Subscriber's private key on a Smart Card, on a USB token, or in a file to the Registration Officer in Customer Organization or to the Subject. When the Subject generates his key pair the private key will be recorded on the Subjects workstation, Smart Card or USB token, a separate delivery of the key is not needed. Software certificates If the key pair is generated using the self service software provided by the CA, the private key is delivered to the Subscriber in a password protected PKCS#12 file. The Registration Officer can download the PKCS#12 file directly from the application or send the Subject a one-time password, The Subject can access the self-service software with the one-time password and generate a key pair and download the PKCS#12 file Smart Cards and USB tokens If the key pair is generated by the Card Manufacturer, the Card Manufacturer delivers the Smart Card that contains the private keys to the address specified in the card order, which is normally the address of the Registration Officer of the Customer Organization. The Registration Officer will deliver the card to the Subject. 6.1.3 Public key delivery to certificate issuer The public key is digitally signed and delivered through an encrypted connection, from the site where the key has been generated, to the CA system. 6.1.4 CA public key delivery to relying parties Not applicable to subscriber keys. Methods to delivered CA certificates to Subscribers and Relying Parties are described in in Telia Company Production CPS. 6.1.5 Key sizes The length of the Subscriber keys generated by the CA in connection with the RSA algorithm is at least 2048 bits.

See section 4.12. for more detailed description. 6.2.5 Private key archival Telia Company does not archive subscriber private keys. 6.2.6 Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module All stipulations regarding the section 6.2.6 Private key transfer into or from a cryptographic module are specified in Telia Company Production CPS. 6.2.7 Private key storage on cryptographic module All stipulations regarding the section 6.2.7 Private key storage on cryptographic module are specified in Telia Company Production CPS. 6.2.8 Method of activating private key Software keys: The CA recommends that the Customer Organizations use passwords for private key activation in accordance with the section 6.4 and take appropriate measures for the physical protection of the workstations or other devices used to store private keys. Copyright © Telia Company Page 30 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 Smart Cards and USB tokens: Activation of the private key of the Subject requires the use of activation data as described in section 6.4. 6.2.9 Method of deactivating private key Software keys: Locking of the private key of the Subject depends on the software in use. Smart Cards and USB tokens: The private key on a Smart Card or USB token will be locked if the activation data related to it is inserted falsely too many times in succession. The lock-out threshold depends on the Smart Card or USB token type used and can be, for example, 3 or 5 failed attempts. A locked key can be returned into use with the help of a PUK code (PUK = PIN Unblocking Key) or equivalent technology (e.g. challenge/response). 6.2.10 Method of destroying private key When the certificate of a Subject has expired and has not been renewed, the private key related to it cannot be used any more in connection with certification services. The key is not returned to the CA to be destroyed but it remains in the possession of the Subscriber. The subscriber private confidentiality keys that are stored by the CA for backup purposes are securely destroyed at the end of service. 6.2.11 Cryptographic module rating See section 6.2.1. 6.3 Other aspects of key pair management 6.3.1 Public key archival The CA stores the Subject public keys according to section 5.5 of the Telia Company Production CPS. 6.3.2 Certificate operational periods and key pair usage periods The usage period of the Subject certificate shall not be longer than five (5) years. The same keys may be certified again on expiration of a certificate, although it is not recommended by the CA. The usage period of the Subject public and private keys shall not exceed the period during which the applied cryptographic algorithms and their pertinent parameters remain cryptographically strong enough or otherwise suitable. 6.4 Activation data The Subscriber uses his private keys with the help of activation data, which are given on the keyboard of a card reader, workstation, mobile phone or other device. 6.4.1 Activation data generation and installation Software keys: When the Subject or Registration Officer in the Customer Organization generates the key pair, a password can be choosen as activation data according to Customer Organization policy. If the Registration Officer of the CA generates the key pair, the activation data will be generated using sufficient number of characters to be secure. Smart Cards and USB tokens: The Card Manufacturer, Customer Organisation or RA system generates the activation data in pursuance of key pair generation. Copyright © Telia Company Page 31 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 When it is possible for the Subscriber to change the activation data, the Subscriber is recommended to make sure that the new activation data consists of sufficiently many characters to be secure. 6.4.2 Activation data protection When the Card Manufacturer generates the key pairs, the activation data is generated at the same time and delivered securely to the Subject. Secure delivery is obtained by using: - Concealed under a protective surface layer or enclosed in a sealed envelope. - Encrypted activation data file. - Or other similar secure method. When the RA office of the CA generates the key pair, the activation data and the private key are sent as separate deliveries through different channels to the Subscriber. The activation data can be delivered for example to a mobile phone as an SMS or it can be given over the phone. When the Registration Officer in a Customer Organization generates the key pairs, the organization is responsible for the secure delivery of the activation data to the Subject. The Subscriber shall instruct the Subject to keep his activation data safe enough. He/She should memorize the activation data. The activation data must not be disclosed to others. 6.4.3 Other aspects of activation data No stipulation.

The aim of the encrypted information is that it shall not be interpretable by anyone who does not hold exactly the right key (in symmetrical encryption) or exactly the right private key (in asymmetrical encryption) required to correctly decrypting the information. E-mail Certificates: Certificates utilized for encrypting and verifying digital signatures. Normally two separate certificate: one for encryption, the other for signature verification. Entity: Any autonomous element or component within the Public Key Infrastructure that participate is one form or another, such managing certificates or utilizing certificates. An Entity can be a CA, RA, Subscriber, Relying Party, etc. FIPS 140-2: Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2(FIPS 140-2) is a standard that describes US Federal government requirements that IT products shall meet for Sensitive, but Unclassified (SBU) use. The standard was published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has been adopted by the Canadian government's Communication Security Establishment (CSE), and is likely to be adopted by the financial community through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The different levels (1 to 4) within the standard provide different levels of security and in the higher levels, have different documentation requirements.

ISO 11568-5: Basic principles and requirements for Key lifecycle for public key cryptosystems, provides instructions to financial institutions in the development, implementation and/or the operation of systems and procedures throughout Key's lifecycle Key: When used in the context of cryptography, it is a secret value, a sequence of characters that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. A key is a unique, generated electronic string of bits used for encrypting, decrypting, e-signing or validating digital signatures. Key holder: In this context, a person, an organisation, an organisational unit or a function which has exclusive control of the private key, the public equivalent of which is certified in a certificate. See also subscriber. Key Pair: Often referred to as public/private key pair. One key is used for encrypting and the other key used for decrypting. Although related, the keys are sufficiently different that knowing one does not allow derivation or computation of the other. This means that one key can be made publicly available without reducing security, provided the other key remains private. Log: A sequential and unbroken list of events in a system or a process. A typical log contains log entries for individual events, each containing information on the event, who initiated it, when it occurred, what it resulted in, etc. MD5: A Message Digest Algorithm.

Non-repudiation services: Service which aim to hold a key holder responsible for signed messages in such a way that they can be verified by a third party at a later point in time. Object Identifier: The unique alpha-numeric identifier registered under the ISO registration standard to reference a standard object or class. Operator: Employee of a CA. Out of band process: Communications which occur outside of a previously established communication method or channel. PKCS #1: Standard that provides recommendations for the implementation of public-key cryptography based on the RSA algorithm, covering the following aspects: cryptographic primitives; encryption schemes; signature schemes, etc. Copyright © Telia Company Page 46 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 PKCS #7: A cryptographic message format or syntax managed and edited by RSA Laboratories. A standard describing general syntax for data that may have cryptography applied to it, such as digital signatures and digital envelopes. PKCS #10: A certificate request format or syntax managed and edited by RSA Laboratories. It is a standard describing syntax for a request for certification of a public key, a name, and possibly a set of attributes. PKIX: The Public Key Infrastructure (X.509) or PKIX is an IETF Working Group established with the intent of developing Internet standards needed to support an X.509-based PKI. The scope of PKIX extends to also develop new standards for use of X.509-based PKIs in the Internet. PKI personnel: Persons, generally employees, associated with the operation, administration and management of a CA or RA. Policy: The set of laws, rules and practices that regulates how an organization manages its business. Specifically, security policy would be the set of laws, rules and practices that regulates how an organization manages, protects and distributes sensitive information. Primary certificate: A certificate which is issued on the basis of identifying key holders other than by the key holder producing another certificate. Identification then normally takes place through the key holder instead producing an identity document. PrintableString: String format for representing names, such as Common Name (CN), in X.509 certificates. The encoding of a value in this syntax is the string value itself. Private Key: The private key is one of the keys in a public/private key pair. This is the key that is kept secret as opposed to the other key that is publicly available. Private keys a utilized for digitally signing documents, uniquely authenticating an individual, or decrypting data that was encrypted with the corresponding public key. Public Key Infrastructure: A set of policies, procedures, technology, audit and control mechanisms used for the purpose of managing certificates and keys. Public: A security classification for information that if disclosed would not result in any personal damage or financial loss. Public Key: The community verification key for digital signature and the community encryption key for encrypting information to a specific Subscriber. RA policy: A named set of rules for the RA's role in producing, issuing and revoking certificates and which regulates the applicability of certificates within a specific area of application. Registration Authority (RA): An entity that performs registration services on behalf of a CA. RAs work with a particular CA to vet requests for certificates that will then be issued by the CA. Copyright © Telia Company Page 47 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 Re-key: The process of replacing or updating the key(s). The expiration of the crypto period involves the replacement of the public key in the certificate and therefore the generation of a new certificate. Relative Distinguished Name (RDN): A Distinguished Name is made up of a sequence of Relative Distinguished Names, or RDNs. The sequences of RDNs are separated by commas (,) or semi-colons (;). There can be more than one identical RDN in a directory, but they must be in different bases, or branches, of the directory. Relying Party: A person or entity that uses a certificate signed by the CA to authenticate a digital signature or encrypt communications to a certificate Subject. The relying party relies on the certificate as a result of the certificate being sign by a CA, which is trusted. A relying party normally is but does not have to be a Subscriber of the PKI. Repository: A place or container where objects are stored. A data repository is technology where data is stored logically. In PKI terms, a repository accepts certificates and CRLs form one or more CAs and makes them available to entities that need them for implementing security services. Revocation: In PKI, revocation is the action associated with revoking a certificate. Revoking a certificate is to make the certificate invalid before its normal expiration. The Certification Authority that issued the certificate is the entity that revokes a certificate. The revoked status is normally published on a certificate revocation list (CRL). RSA: A public key cryptographic algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman. Secondary certificate: A certificate issued on the basis of another certificate, the primary certificate. This means that the issuing CA relies on the CA which issued the primary certificate, i.e. accepts the public key's certification of the key holder, which is turn requires reliance on the identification of the key holder when issuing the primary certificate being correct. Sensitive: Used to describe the security classification of information where the information if disclosed would result in serious financial loss, serious loss in confidence or could result in personal harm or death. Signature Verification Certificate: Often referred to as simply a Signature Certificate. It is the certificate containing the public key used to verify a digital signature that was signed by the corresponding private key. Split Knowledge A condition under which two or more parties separately and confidentially have custody of components of a single key that, individually, convey no knowledge of the resultant cryptographic key. The resultant key exists only within secure cryptographic devices. SSL Client Certificate: Certificate utilized to verify the authentication of an end user to a server when a connection is being established via a SSL session (secure channel). SSL Server Certificate: Certificate utilized to verify the authentication of a web or application server to the end user (client) when a connection is being established via a SSL session (secure channel). Storage module: In this document relates to cryptographic module. Copyright © Telia Company Page 48 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 Subject: Entity identified in a certificate as the holder of the private key associated with the public key given in the certificate. [ETSI TS 101 456 v1.2.1] Subject can also be a device (a data network component or software, hereafter referred to as "Device").

[ETSI TS 101 456 v1.2.1] Surveillance Camera: A surveillance camera is a video recording device used for detection and identification of unauthorized physical entry to a secured area. A camera used for recording a signing ceremony for auditing purposes is not considered a surveillance camera. Symmetric encryption: Encryption system characterised by both the sender and the recipient of encrypted information using the same secret key for both encryption and decryption. Threat: A danger to an asset in terms of that asset's confidentiality, integrity, availability or legitimate use. Token: Hardware devices, normally associated with a reader, used to store and/or generate encryption keys, such as smartcards and USB tokens. Trusted Third Party (TTP): A party on which two or more collaborative parties rely. A TTP carries out services for the collaborative parties, such as time-stamping, certificate issuing, etc. Trusting party: A recipient of a certificate which trusts this certificate on authentication, verification of digital signatures and/or encryption of information. See also Relying Party. Unambiguous identity: An identity comprising a set of attributes which relate unambiguously to a specific person. The unambiguous connection between the identity and the person may be dependant on the context within which the identity term is used. Certain contexts may require assistance from the current registrar of various attributes. URI Universal Resource Indicator - an address on the Internet. UTF8String UTF-8 is a type of Unicode, which is a character set supported across many commonly used software applications and operating systems. UTF-8 is a multibyte encoding in which each character can be encoded in as little as one byte and as many as four bytes. Most Western European languages require less than two bytes per character. Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Russian require an average of 1.7 bytes. Japanese, Korean, and Chinese typically require three bytes per character. Such Unicode is important to ensure that universal /foreign characters are supported. Verification: The process of ensuring that an assumption is correct. This term relates primarily to the process of ensuring that a digital signature represents the party which the signed information details as its issuer. Vettor: A person who verifies information provided by a person applying for a certificate. Vulnerability: Weaknesses in a safeguard or the absence of a safeguard. Copyright © Telia Company Page 49 Telia Company Organizational Person Certificate CPS 1st December 2016 Written: Where this CPS specifies that information shall be written, this requirement is generally also met by digital data provided that the information it contains is accessible in such a way that it is useable by the parties involved. X.500 Specification of the directory service required to support X.400 e-mail initially but common used by other applications as well. X501 PrintableString: String format for representing names, such as Common Name (CN), in X.509 certificates.
