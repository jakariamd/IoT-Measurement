IMPORTANT: Never apply silicone spray or other substances to the walking belt or the walking plat- form. Such substances will deteriorate the walking belt and cause excessive wear. HOW TO PLUG IN THE POWER CORD DANGER: Improper connection of the equipment-grounding conductor can result in an increased risk of electric shock. Check with a qualified electrician or service- man if you are in doubt as to whether the product is properly grounded. Do not modify the plug provided with the product-if it will not fit the outlet, have a proper outlet installed by a qualified electrician. Your treadmill, like any other type of sophisticated electronic equipment, can be seriously damaged by sudden voltage changes in your home's power. Voltage surges, spikes, and noise interference can result from weather conditions or from other appliances being turned on or off. To decrease the possibility of your treadmill being damaged, always use a surge suppressor with your treadmill (see drawing 1 at the right). Surge suppressors are sold at most hardware stores and department stores. Use only a single-outlet surge suppressor that is UL 1449 listed as a transient voltage surge suppressor (TVSS). The surge suppressor must have a UL suppressed voltage rating of 400 volts or less and a minimum surge dissipation of 450 joules. The surge suppressor must be electrically rated for 120 volts AC and 15 amps. This product must be grounded. If it should malfunc- tion or break down, grounding provides a path of least resistance for electric current to reduce the risk of elec- tric shock. This product is equipped with a cord having an equipment-grounding conductor and a grounding plug. Plug the power cord into a surge suppressor, and plug the surge suppressor into an appropriate outlet that is properly installed and grounded in accordance with all local codes and ordinances. This product is for use on a nominal 120-volt circuit, and has a grounding plug that looks like the plug illus- trated in drawing 1 below. A temporary adapter that looks like the adapter illustrated in drawing 2 may be used to connect the surge suppressor to a 2-pole receptacle as shown in drawing 2 if a properly grounded outlet is not available. Grounded Outlet Box Surge Suppressor Grounding Pin Grounding Pin Grounded Outlet Grounding Plug Grounded Outlet Box Adapter Surge Suppressor Lug Metal Screw The temporary adapter should be used only until a properly grounded outlet (drawing 1) can be installed by a qualified electrician. The green-colored rigid ear, lug, or the like extending from the adapter must be connected to a permanent ground such as a properly grounded outlet box cover. Whenever the adapter is used it must be held in place by a metal screw. Some 2-pole receptacle outlet box covers are not grounded. Contact a qualified elec- trician to determine if the outlet box cover is grounded before using an adapter.

CONDITIONING GUIDELINES WARNING: Before beginning this or any exercise program, consult your physician. This is especially important for in- dividuals over the age of 35 or individuals with pre-existing health problems. The following guidelines will help you to plan your ex- ercise program. Remember-these are general guide- lines only. For more detailed exercise information, ob- tain a reputable book or consult your physician. EXERCISE INTENSITY Whether your goal is to burn fat or to strengthen your cardiovascular system, the key to achieving the de- sired results is to exercise with the proper intensity. The proper intensity level can be found by using your heart rate as a guide. The chart below shows recom- mended heart rates for fat burning and aerobic exer- cise. (This chart is also found on the console.) To find the proper heart rate for you, first find your age on the left side of the chart (ages are rounded off to the nearest ten years). Next, find the three numbers to the right of your age. The three numbers are your "training zone." The lower two numbers are recom- mended heart rates for fat burning; the higher number is the recommended heart rate for aerobic exercise. Fat Burning To burn fat effectively, you must exercise at a relatively low intensity level for a sustained period of time. During the first few minutes of exercise, your body uses easily accessible carbohydrate calories for energy. Only after the first few minutes does your body begin to use stored fat calories for energy. If your goal is to burn fat, adjust the speed and incline of the treadmill until your heart rate is near one of the lower two numbers in your training zone. It may also be helpful to set the speed control on the console to FAT BURN to help you main- tain the proper intensity level. (See page 9.) Aerobic Exercise If your goal is to strengthen your cardiovascular sys- tem, your exercise must be "aerobic." Aerobic exercise is activity that requires large amounts of oxygen for prolonged periods of time. This increases the demand on the heart to pump blood to the muscles, and on the lungs to oxygenate the blood. For aerobic exercise, adjust the speed and incline of the treadmill until your heart rate is near the highest number in your training zone. It may also be helpful to set the speed control on the console to AEROBIC to help you maintain the proper intensity level. (See page 9.) High Performance Athletic Conditioning If your goal is high performance athletic conditioning, set the speed control on the console to PERFOR- MANCE to help you maintain the proper intensity level. (See page 9.) Note: During the first few weeks of your exercise program, keep your heart rate near the low end of your training zone. HOW TO MEASURE YOUR HEART RATE To measure your heart rate, stop ex- ercising and place two fingers on your wrist as shown. Take a six- second heartbeat count, and multiply the result by ten to find your heart rate. (A six-second count is used because your heart rate drops quickly when you stop exercising.) If your heart rate is too high or too low, adjust the speed or in- cline of the treadmill accordingly. WORKOUT GUIDELINES A well-rounded workout includes the following three important parts: A Warm-up Start each workout with 5 to 10 minutes of stretching and light exercise (see SUGGESTED STRETCHES on page 15). A proper warm-up increases your body temperature, heart rate, and circulation in preparation for exercise. Training Zone Exercise After warming up, increase the intensity of your exer- cise until your pulse is in your training zone for 20 to 60 minutes. (During the first few weeks of your exer- cise program, do not keep your pulse in your training zone for longer than 20 minutes.) Breathe regularly and deeply as you exercise-never hold your breath. A Cool-down to cool down. This will increase the flexibility of your muscles and will help to prevent post-exercise problems. Exercise Frequency To maintain or improve your condition, complete three workouts each week, with at least one day of rest be- tween workouts. After a few months, you may com- plete up to five workouts each week if desired. Finish each workout with 5 to 10 minutes of stretching The key to success is to make exercise a regular and enjoyable part of your everyday life. SUGGESTED STRETCHES The correct form for several basic stretches is shown in the drawings below. Move slowly as you stretch-never bounce. 1. Toe Touch Stretch Stand with your knees bent slightly and slowly bend forward from your hips. Allow your back and shoulders to relax as you reach down toward your toes as far as possible. Hold for 15 counts, then relax. Repeat 3 times. Stretches: Hamstrings, back of knees, and back. 2. Hamstring Stretch Sit with one leg extended. Bring the sole of the opposite foot toward you and rest it against the inner thigh of your extended leg. Reach toward your toes as far as possible. Hold for 15 counts, then relax. Repeat 3 times for each leg. Stretches: Hamstrings, lower back, and groin. 3. Calf/Achilles Stretch With one leg in front of the other, reach forward and place your hands against a wall. Keep your back leg straight and your back foot flat on the floor. Bend your front leg, lean forward and move your hips toward the wall. Hold for 15 counts, then relax. Repeat 3 times for each leg. To cause further stretching of the achilles tendons, bend your back leg as well. Stretches: Calves, achilles tendons, and ankles. 4. Quadriceps Stretch With one hand against a wall for balance, reach back and grasp one foot with your other hand. Bring your heel as close to your buttocks as possible. Hold for 15 counts, then relax. Repeat 3 times for both legs. Stretches: Quadriceps and hip muscles. 5. Inner Thigh Stretch Sit with the soles of your feet together and your knees outward. Pull your feet toward your groin area as far as possible. Hold for 15 counts, then relax. Repeat 3 times. Stretches: Quadriceps and hip muscles. PART LIST-Model No. 831.297140 R0198A Key No. Qty.
