DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND WAIVER OF CLASS 10. ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS 10.1 Disputes. The terms of this Section 10 shall apply to all Disputes between you and WDT. For the purposes of this Section 10 and subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 10.1, "Dispute" shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and WDT arising out of or relating to the Software, WDT Devices, this Agreement, or other transaction involving you and WDT, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law. YOU AND WDT AGREE THAT "DISPUTE" AS DEFINED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR WDT FOR (A) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (C) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (D) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. MOREOVER, NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION 10.6, YOU AGREE THAT A COURT, NOT THE ARBITRATOR, MAY DECIDE IF A CLAIM FALLS WITHIN ONE OF THESE FOUR EXCEPTIONS. INFRINGEMENT, (B) PATENT 10.2 Binding Arbitration. You and WDT further agree: (a) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in this Agreement; (b) this Agreement memorializes a transaction in interstate commerce; (c) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 10; and (d) this Section 10 shall survive termination of this Agreement. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED. The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction could, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties. 10.3 Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court's jurisdiction and is pending only in that court. 10.4 Dispute Notice. In the event of a Dispute, you or WDT must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice to WDT must be addressed to: Western Digital Technologies, Inc., ATTN: Legal Department, 3355 Michelson Drive, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92612, U.S.A. (the "WDT Notice Address"). The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address WDT has on file or otherwise in our records for you. If WDT and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or WDT may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section 10. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of the parties agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration. 10.5 WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS. YOU AND WDT AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, UNDER THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES OUTLINED IN THIS SECTION, AN ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT COMBINE OR CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY'S CLAIMS WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL AFFECTED PARTIES TO AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. 10.6 Arbitration Procedure. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the "JAMS Rules"), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this Agreement. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement, the rules set forth in this Agreement shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (a) trade secret misappropriation, (b) patent infringement, (c) copyright infringement or misuse, or (d) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of "Disputes" in Section 10.1. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Orange County, California, at your option. (a) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding. If either you or WDT decides to arbitrate a Dispute, both parties agree to the following procedure: (i) Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.jamsadr.com ("Demand for Arbitration"). (ii) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to: JAMS 500 North State College Blvd., Suite 600 Orange, CA 92868, U.S.A. (iii) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. (b) Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by WDT or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or WDT is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. (c) Arbitration Fees. WDT shall pay, or (if applicable) reimburse you for, all JAMS filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration commenced (by you or WDT) pursuant to provisions of this Agreement. (d) Award in Your Favor. For Disputes in which you or WDT seeks $75,000 or less in damages exclusive of attorney's fees and costs, if the arbitrator's decision results in an award to you in an amount greater than WDT's last written offer, if any, to settle the Dispute, WDT will: (i) pay you $1,000 or the amount of the award, whichever is greater; (ii) pay you twice the amount of your reasonable attorney's fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse you for any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing the Dispute in arbitration. Except as agreed upon by you and WDT in writing, the arbitrator shall determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses to be paid by WDT pursuant to this Section 10.6(d). (e) Attorney's Fees. WDT will not seek its attorney's fees and expenses for any arbitration commenced involving a Dispute under this Agreement. Your right to attorney's fees and expenses under Section 10.6(d) above does not limit your rights to attorney's fees and expenses under applicable law; notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator may not award duplicative awards of attorney's fees and expenses. (f) Opt-out. You may elect to opt-out (exclude yourself) from the final, binding, individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this Agreement by sending a written letter to the WDT Notice Address within thirty (30) days of your assent to this Agreement (including without limitation the purchase, download, installation of the Software or other applicable use of WDT Devices, products and services) that specifies (i) your name, (ii) your mailing address, and (iii) your request to be excluded from the final, binding individual arbitration procedure and waiver of class and representative proceedings specified in this Section 10. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall continue to apply, including the requirement to provide notice prior to litigation. 10.7 Amendments to Section 10. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and WDT agree that if WDT makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to WDT's address) in this Agreement, WDT will obtain your affirmative assent to the applicable amendment. If you do not affirmatively assent to the applicable amendment, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between the parties in accordance with the language of this Section 10. 10.8 Severability. If any provision in this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of this Agreement remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions as provided in Section 10.5; if Section 10.5 is found to be unenforceable, the entire Section 10 (but only Section 10) shall be null and void. 11.
