Camera's Settings Page from the Web Browser Able to access the camera by directly specifying the IP address from a web browser. If there is an IP address assigned by the DHCP server, specify it, otherwise specify "192.168.100.1". Important (cid:129) Able to access with the IP address of 192.168.100.1 approximately 2 minutes after connecting the camera to the network environment. (cid:129) If an IPv4 address is assigned by the DHCP server, it will switch to that address and access by 192.168.100.1 will not be possible. (cid:129) If there are devices with 192.168.100.1 on the same network, the same IP address will be assigned, and access to the camera with 192.168.100.1 will not be possible. 1 When accessing with 192.168.100.1., set the IP address of the computer. Set the IP address of the computer to the same network as 192.168.100.1 such as 192.168.100.xxx. 2 Launch the web browser. 3 Enter the camera's IP address in the address column of the web browser and press [Enter]. The [Default Settings (1/2)] screen of the camera is displayed. 4 Perform steps 4 to 5 of the previous section "Settings for the Camera Search Tool". After the camera reboots, the Settings Page is displayed and settings are able to be configured. Note If necessary, restore the computer settings changed in step 1. Chapter Camera Setup The settings required to use the camera are made on the Settings Page. Before starting operation, make various settings on the Settings Page according to the shooting conditions and purpose. There are also menus that can be performed during operation, such as camera maintenance. Overview Follow the steps below to connect to cameras either by wires or wirelessly and to display the Settings Page. Accessing from a Web Browser Follow the steps below to display the Settings Page according to the connection method to the camera (wired or wireless LAN). The Settings Page can only be connected with an Administrator Account. Important (cid:129) In the case the Administrator Account is forgotten, return settings to factory default settings (P. 102). However, because the Administrator Account and other settings will be initialized, it will no longer be able to connect to the camera as it is. Use the Camera Search tool to perform initialization setting. (cid:129) Do not open multiple Setting Pages at one time and try to change the settings of a single camera.  For Wired LAN Enter the IP address set in "Initial Camera Settings" (P. 17) directly into the web browser to display the Camera's Settings Page 1 Launch the web browser. 2 Enter the IP address and press Enter The authentication screen of the Settings Page is displayed. 3 Enter Administrator Name and Administrator Password, then click [Sign in] The Settings Page is displayed.  For Wireless LAN Even when using with a wireless LAN, it is necessary to first connect with a wired LAN and configure the wireless LAN settings. 1 Display the Settings Page according to the procedure in the previous section "For Wired LAN" 2 Enable wireless LAN. Click the [System] tab and set [Wireless LAN] to [Enable] in [Communication] > [Wireless LAN], configure [Access Point] and [IPv4], then restart the camera.

How to install network devices (Wireless LAN support) (cid:129) When using a wireless LAN indoors, install the camera and network device in the same room. (cid:129) Install the camera and network device in a location with good visibility, where there is no interference from people or objects. (cid:129) Place the camera and network device as close to each other as possible. If necessary, change the installation height and orientation. Surrounding Electronic Devices (cid:129) If the network speed becomes slow due to the influence of nearby electronic devices (radio interference), changing the channel may solve the problem. (cid:129) IEEE 802.11 b/g/n wireless LANs use the same 2.4 GHz frequency band as microwave ovens, cordless phones, wireless microphones, and Bluetooth devices. This slows down the network speed if these devices are in the vicinity. (cid:129) If an access point that uses the same frequency band as the camera is operating nearby, the network speed will be slower. Using Multiple Cameras (cid:129) Do not duplicate IP addresses of devices in the same network. (cid:129) To reduce radio interference, set a four-channel interval for the wireless LAN, for example, "1, 6, 11", "2, 7, 12", or "3, 8, 13". Configuration of the Settings Page The configuration of the Settings Page is as follows: (1) (2) (5) (6) (9) to (16)  Header (3) (4) Header (7) (8) Video display/ operation area Settings area This area is common to all Settings Pages.

(Full Auto) The exposure (iris, shutter speed, gain, etc.) and white balance settings are adjusted automatically. (Program AE) The exposure (iris, shutter speed, gain, etc.) settings are adjusted automatically. It is possible to set [AGC Limit], [AE Shift], [Metering Mode], and [AE Response]. (Shutter Priority AE) N300 The shutter speed is adjusted manually. The gain and iris are adjusted automatically. (Iris Priority AE) N300 The iris is adjusted manually. The shutter speed and gain are adjusted automatically. (Manual Exposure) The exposure (iris, shutter speed, gain, etc.) is adjusted manually. (Portrait) N300 Blurs the background to make the subject stand out. (Sports) N300 Captures fast moving subjects. (Low Light) N300 Brightly captures subjects in dark locations. (Spotlight) N300 Captures subjects illuminated by a spotlight beautifully. Note (cid:129) In (Portrait), (Sports), (Low Light), and (Spotlight), the exposure (iris, shutter speed, gain, etc.) settings are adjusted automatically. In the [WB/Color] tab, only [White Balance Mode] and [Color Temperature (K)] are displayed. The [Image Quality] tab and the [Image Quality Details] tab cannot be selected. N300 (cid:129) In (Portrait) and (Sports), the captured video may not appear smooth or may flicker. N300 (cid:129) For precautions regarding shooting in (Shutter Priority AE) and (Low Light), refer to "About Shooting with Slow Shutter" (P. 30). N300 (cid:129) The items that can be set differ depending on the shooting mode. The details are shown below. : Items which can be set : Items which are set automatically -: Items which cannot be set Shooting Mode N300 N300 N300 Item Iris ND Filter Shutter Mode N500 N300 *1 *1 *3 *2 *2 Shooting Mode N300 N300 N300 Item Gain AGC Limit AE Shift Metering Mode AE Response Flicker Reduction Auto Slow Shutter N300 *4 *1 Possible to select [Auto] or off. *2 Linked to the iris settings. *3 Possible to set the shutter speed. *4 Possible only if one of Shutter Mode, Iris and Gain is set to [Auto]. [Iris (Aperture Value)] Adjusts the iris (aperture) according to the brightness of the subject. When [Auto] is set, the iris is automatically adjusted. When [Auto] is off, the iris can be manually adjusted. Moving the slider to the left opens the aperture and brightens the video. Moving it to the right narrows the aperture and darkens the video. Following aperture values can be set. N500 F2.8, F3.1, F3.4, F3.7, F4.0, F4.4, F4.5, F4.8, F5.2, F5.6, F6.2, F6.7, F7.3, F8.0, F8.7, F9.5, F10, F11 N300 F1.8, F2.0, F2.2, F2.4, F2.6, F2.8, F3.1, F3.4, F3.7, F4.0, F4.4, F4.8, F5.2, F5.6, F6.2, F6.7, F7.3, F8.0 The aperture value that can be set differs depending on the zoom position. Reference aperture value is displayed on the screen. N500 N300 Maximum wide angle: F2.8 to F11, maximum telephoto: F4.5 to F11 Maximum wide angle: F1.8 to F8.0, maximum telephoto: F2.8 to F8.0 Note (cid:129) By changing the depth of field and blur the background or surroundings to make the subject stand out, set a smaller aperture value, and to keep everything from close objects to far-away objects in focus, set a larger aperture value. (cid:129) When shooting in a bright location, narrowing down the iris can cause blurring. It is possible to prevent blurring by adjusting the ND filter and shutter speed and opening the iris. (cid:129) When [AUTO] of the iris is set to off, the aperture value from Auto is inherited. The aperture value before setting to [AUTO] is not restored. N500 [ND Filter] Choose whether to use the ND filter. ND filter can be switched to three levels (1/4, 1/16, 1/64). The ND filter allows to open the aperture for a video with shallow depth of field even in a bright environment. This is also convenient for avoiding blur caused by narrowing down the aperture. Note Changing the ND Filter settings in certain shooting conditions could generate some slight change in coloring. In this case, it is effective to set the white balance when shooting (P. 31). N300 [ND Filter] When the [Shooting Mode] is set to or larger, ND filter is automatically adjusted linked to the setting of the iris. In other shooting modes, when [Iris (Aperture Value)] is F4.0 or larger, the exposure is automatically adjusted using the ND filter. (Manual Exposure), the exposure without using the ND filter, [Auto] can be set to off. (Manual Exposure) and the [Iris (Aperture Value)] is F4.0 (Shutter Priority AE), in order to adjust (Iris Priority AE) or (Program AE), or (Iris Priority AE), Note When the [Shooting Mode] is set to is always automatically adjusted. (Full Auto), (Portrait), (Sports), (Low Light), or (Spotlight), ND filter [Shutter Mode] Adjusting the shutter speed enables to adapt to the subjects and the shooting environment, making it possible to capture fast-moving subjects (sports, vehicles, etc.) clearly and brighten low-light scenes, etc. Shutter speed can be adjusted in the following modes: [Auto (sec.)] Automatically adjusts the shutter speed according to the brightness of the video. [Speed (sec.)] Sets the shutter speed to seconds. The shutter speed can also be set to a value higher than the frame rate. [Slow (sec.)] Sets the shutter speed slower than the frame rate to seconds. This setting is used for shooting in low-light areas. Also, special effects such as "blurring the background" and "adding residual image effects to zoom" are available for shooting a moving subject with pan operation. For precautions when shooting in slow, refer to "About Shooting with Slow Shutter" (P. 30). [Clear Scan (Hz)] Sets the shutter speed by frequency. This is used to reduce black bands on the screen, flickering from fluorescent lighting, and to fine tune the brightness. The shutter speed that can be selected differs depending on the frame frequency. Shutter Mode 23.98 29.97 59.94 25.00 50.00 Frame Frequency (Hz) Auto (sec.) 1/24 - 1/2000 1/30 - 1/2000 1/60 - 1/2000 1/25 - 1/2000 1/50 - 1/2000 Speed (sec.) 1/24 - 1/2000 1/30 - 1/2000 1/60 - 1/2000 1/25 - 1/2000 1/50 - 1/2000 Slow (sec.)

[Gain (dB)] Able to set the amplification amount of the video amplifier. When [Auto] is set, the gain is automatically adjusted. By setting the [AGC Limit], the maximum gain can be limited. When [Auto] is off, the gain can be manually adjusted. Adjustment can be made in the ranges below. N500 N300 -6.0 to 33.0 dB (by 0.5) 0.0 to 36.0 dB (by 0.5) When [Image Quality] > [Gamma] is [Wide DR] or [Canon Log3], the adjustment range is 2.5 to 33.0 dB. N500 Note Increasing the gain may cause a slightly grainy screen. Also, uneven colors, white dots, and vertical lines may appear on the screen. [AGC Limit] Able to suppress the occurrence of grainy screen, uneven colors, white dots, vertical lines, etc. by limiting the maximum value when the gain is set to [Auto]. Adjustment can be made in the ranges below. N500 N300 -6.0 to 33.0 dB (by 0.5) 0.0 to 36.0 dB (by 0.5) When [Image Quality] > [Gamma] is [Wide DR] or [Canon Log3], the adjustment range is 2.5 to 33.0 dB. N500 Note When the shooting mode is N500 N300 Maximum 33.0 dB Maximum 24.0 dB (Full Auto), the [AGC Limit] value will not be applied. It will be limited by the maximum values below. [AE Shift] When one of the [Iris (Aperture Value)], [Shutter Mode] or [Gain (dB)] is set to auto, the exposure can intentionally be compensated to capture subjects either at a brighter or darker exposure. Move the slider to a negative value to darken the image, or to a positive value to lighten it. Adjustment can be made in the range of -2 levels to +2 levels (by 0.25). [Metering Mode] When one of the [Iris (Aperture Value)], [Shutter Mode] or [Gain (dB)] is set to Auto, and the metering mode is set to match the shooting scene, it is possible to shoot with more appropriate brightness. [Standard] Meters the entire screen while focusing on the subject in the center of the screen. [Backlight] Controls darker areas of the screen more brightly when shooting backlight scenes. [Spotlight] Controls the brightness of the subject in the spotlight. [AE Response] Select the response of AE when one of the [Iris (Aperture Value)], [Shutter Mode] or [Gain (dB)] is set to Auto. The set values are High, Normal, and Low in order of the shortest time to achieve the proper exposure. [Flicker Reduction] Setting [On] automatically detects and corrects flickering from fluorescent lights. Note (cid:129) Erroneous flicker detection may cause horizontal noise. In this case, avoid using [Flicker Reduction]. (cid:129) When the frame frequency is 23.98 Hz, flicker reduction is not effective even when set. (cid:129) When shooting under an artificial light source such as a fluorescent lamp, mercury lamp, or halogen light, flicker may occur in principle depending on the shutter speed set. It may be possible to suppress flicker by setting the shutter speed according to the frequency of the power supply. For 50 Hz, select 1/50 second* or 1/100 second; for 60 Hz, select 1/60 second or 1/120 second. * Not available depending on the frame frequency. N300 [Auto Slow Shutter] When shooting in a place with insufficient light (such as a room with low light), slows down the shutter speed automatically and adjust to make the video brighter. Possible to set when the shooting mode is (Full Auto) and (Program AE). Note (cid:129) The slowest shutter speed for each frame frequency differs as follows. At 23.98 Hz: 1/12 sec. At 29.97 HZ: 1/15 sec. At 59.94 Hz: 1/30 sec. At 25.00 Hz: 1/12 sec. At 50.00 Hz: 1/25 sec. (cid:129) Auto slow shutter cannot be used under the conditions below. - When AGC limit is enabled - When frame frequency is 23.98 Hz, 29.97 Hz, or 25.00Hz, and [Focus] > [Face Detection AF] is [Face Det. & Tracking] or [Face Only] (cid:129) For the precautions when shooting with auto slow shutter, refer to the following section "About Shooting with Slow Shutter".  About Shooting with Slow Shutter N300 (Low Light) (Manual Exposure) or , or setting the [Auto Slow Shutter] By setting the [Shooting Mode] to speed, setting it to the subject brightly even where the light is insufficient. However, depending on the scene or the subject, the following may occur. - Noticeable residual image from moving subjects - Deterioration of image quality - White spots on the screen - Autofocus not functioning well to [ON], it is possible to shoot to set a slow shutter (Shutter Priority AE) N300 N300 WB/Color Settings Setting the white balance and color matrix settings.

Switch the [AF] on in the focus mode to select the autofocus or switch it to off to select the manual focus. The items that can be set differ depending on the focus mode. Autofocus Autofocus adjusts the focus automatically. [Focus Mode] Turning [AF] on switches to autofocus mode. [Adjust Focus] Able to adjust the focus manually even when [AF] is set to on. Click [Near] to move the focus position to the near side, and [Far] to move the focus position to the far side. Click and hold the button to move continuously. Release the button to return to auto focus. [AF Frame Size] Able to change the size and position of the AF frame displayed on the screen when adjusting with autofocus. When the AF frame size is set to [Big] or [Small], selecting the position of the AF frame is possible. During face detection or subject tracking, the size and position of the AF frame automatically changes to match the face and subject (P. 38). [Auto] Focuses on the subject in the center of the screen. No frame is displayed. [Small], [Big] Focuses on the subject in the AF frame shown. Able to move the AF frame to any position within 80% of the screen (P. 38). AF frame [Face Detection AF] Sets the operation of the face detection AF (the ability to detect and focus on a person's face). [Off] Focuses on the AF frame or the center of the screen. Face detection is not performed. [Face Det. & Tracking] Gives priority to focus on a person's face. (cid:129) When there is a person's face in the screen When multiple people are in the screen, the main subject is automatically determined. The following face frame is displayed regardless of the [AF Frame Size] setting. Frame representing the main face (if even one face) Frame representing a non-main face Click on a face frame to track that face (P. 38). (cid:129) When there is no face in the screen The [AF Frame Size] setting determines the focus position (P. 38). [Face Only] Focuses only on the person's face. If there is a person's face in the screen, follows the procedure described in the previous section, [Face Det. & Tracking]. If there isn't any person's face in the screen, the focus is locked until a face is detected. [Touch Operation] For screen operations, refer to "Clicking on the Screen" (P. 38). [Cancel Tracking] Cancels tracking when tracking a specified subject (P. 38). [AF Mode] Selects the autofocus mode. [Continuous] Always on autofocus. [AF-Boosted MF] Click [Near] or [Far] to roughly adjust the focus of the target subject, and it will automatically adjust the focus when the subject approaches the in-focus position. Use this mode when the video size is large, such as [3840 x 2160], or when wanting to prevent the focus from becoming less precise during shooting. In addition, since an uncertain adjustment operation is not performed when adjustment information cannot be detected, adjustment can be performed more stably than [Continuous]. [AF Speed] Selects the autofocus adjustment speed. The setting values are High, Normal, and Low in order of speed. [AF Response] Selects the responsiveness of the autofocus. The setting values are High, Normal, and Low in order of the shortest time until the focus operation starts. [Focus Limit] Reduces the time to achieve the focus by limiting the focus range. When set to [On], the focus range is limited to 60 cm (2 ft.) to  (throughout the entire zoom range). When set to off, the range is 1 cm (0.39 in.; at full wide-angle) to , including the macro area.  Clicking on the Screen Click the screen to move the AF frame to that position. Even if a person or subject moves in the screen, it is possible to keep the focus on the main subject. This is called tracking. When [Face Detection AF] is [Off] If [AF Frame Size] is [Big] or [Small], the AF frame moves to the point where clicked. When [AF Frame Size] is set to [Auto], the subject in the center of the screen stays in focus and the AF frame will not be displayed. When [Face Detection AF] is [Face Det. & Tracking] When clicking on a person's face, a tracking frame appears on the face, and the tracking will be in progress. Tracking Frame If something other than the face of a person is clicked, depending on the AF frame size, the operation differs as follows. When [AF Frame Size] is set to [Auto], the tracking frame appears on the subject clicked on the screen and is tracked. If [AF Frame Size] is set to [Big] or [Small], and [Touch Operation] is set to [Normal], when there is no person's face, the AF frame appears where it was clicked. If there is a person's face in the screen, the face frame remains displayed. When [AF Frame Size] is set to [Big] or [Small] and [Touch Operation] is set to [Select Tracked Object], a tracking frame is displayed on the subject clicked on the screen and is tracked. Note When the tracking frame is displayed, the face frame will not be displayed. When [Face Only] is selected for [Face Detection AF] Clicking a person's face is the same as in [Face Det. & Tracking] in the previous section. If something other than a person's face is clicked, the focus does not change.  Autofocus (cid:129) The focus position for autofocus varies slightly depending on the shooting conditions such as the subject, brightness, and zoom position. Check the focus again before shooting. (cid:129) Focus adjustment can take a while when the frame frequency is 29.97 Hz, 25.00 Hz, or 23.98 Hz. (cid:129) It may be difficult to focus with autofocus in certain cases. Shooting conditions that are difficult to focus with autofocus Strong light is reflected. Center of the screen has little light/dark difference.

Since this camera has a variety of server functions built in, although they can be convenient, there is a risk of being attacked by a third party unless operated with security measures. To completely eliminate all risks is impossible, however, by studying various risk angles and taking measures based on the security policies, it is possible to decrease the risk of cyber attacks. This section explains the security hardening measures to the camera settings. Refer to this section and implement necessary measures according to the environment under the customer's responsibility, which will lead to safer camera operation. System administrators are advised to read. Important To the full extent permitted by laws and regulations, neither Canon Inc. nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates shall be liable for any losses, direct, incidental or consequential damages, or liabilities that may be incurred as a result of network security incidents such as unauthorized accesses. The security hardening measures explained in this section are mainly for the cameras, which are a part of an entire system as shown in the figure below. For the entire system's security hardening, measures must be taken according to the customer's network environment and/or purpose of the camera use. Controller Internet Router PoE Hub Camera This section mainly explains the security hardening measures possible for the camera's functions and settings. Computer Computer Local Network Area In order to reduce the security risk, it is effective to block access physically and/or virtually if it is unnecessary to be made accessible from an external network, such as the internet. When access from a remote location is unnecessary and the devices accessing the camera can be limited, using only specific devices in the same local area network will enhance security. When it is necessary to access the camera from a remote location, it is important to use a method that can communicate safely, such as using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) that can block access from the outside. 114 Basic Measure 1: Setting Administrator Name and Password The administrator account has authority over all of the camera's settings and operations. If the administrator account is illegally used by an unauthorized party and tampering is done, there is a risk the camera will not be accessible. In order to prevent spoofing of the administrator account, the most fundamental measure for safe operation of the camera is to make the administrator name and password in an array of letters that are difficult to guess by unauthorized users. Strictly manage the administrator account and refrain from settings such as the same administrator account on multiple cameras. The administrator account needs to be set when the camera is started for the first time. After setting, editing can be done on the camera's Settings Page (P. 73).  Setting a Strong Administrator Name and Password In order to strengthen the administrator name and password, consider the following points: (cid:129) Combine at least 10 characters of alphanumeric characters or symbols and special characters permitted for the camera. (cid:129) Combine upper and lower case characters. (cid:129) Avoid commonly used words and string of characters that are easy to guess.  Other Passwords For the camera, in addition to the administrator account, the password for Wireless LAN (P. 62), Server Certificate (P. 70), Authorized User (P. 73), and Encrypting Backup Information (P. 84) are to be set. Set these passwords in an array of letters that are difficult to guess by unauthorized parties and manage them appropriately. Basic Measure 2: Using the Latest Firmware The camera's firmware is updated as needed in order to improve performance of the functions and bug fixes. From the security point of view, it is important to always keep it updated because the measures against known vulnerabilities are applied to the latest firmware. Check Canon's website regularly at the initial setting after purchasing the camera and during its operation, whether the latest firmware is provided. The firmware version can be confirmed and updated on the camera's Settings Page (P. 82, 85). Basic Measure 3: Setting Date and Time Set the correct date and time for the camera. It is recommended to set the time to an NTP server if connected to the Internet. If there are indications that suspicious unauthorized access occurred, it may be possible to confirm the date and time of occurrence by checking the log. Date and time is set on the camera's Settings Page (P. 78). Basic Measure 4: Monitoring the Log Camera connection status and operating conditions are recorded and saved as a log in the camera embedded memory. Check the logs periodically to quickly find any signs of suspicious unauthorized access, such as repeated user authentication failures. For details on the log, refer to the "List of Log Messages" (P. 95). The logs will be deleted if any of the following operations are performed: rebooting, initialization, and restoring to the factory default settings. The log will also be deleted if exceeding a certain size. The log saved in the camera embedded memory can be confirmed on the camera's Settings Page (P. 86). 115 Measures Suitable to the Users' Environment 1: User Management "Administrator", "authorized user", and "guest user" are the three types of accounts that are able to access the camera. The administrator account has authority over all of the camera's settings and operations. Administrator is the only account which is able to access the Settings Page. Therefore, in order to prevent leaks to unauthorized users, it is important to strictly manage information on the administrator account. The "authorized user" and "guest user" are able to access the camera from such as controllers. Understand what the "authorized user" and "guest user" are able to do, and set the minimum necessary authorization level and users. "Authorized Users" Means Users Who Require Authentication To allow only specific users, except the administrator, to control the camera and distribute the video, set up an authorized user. In the authorized user settings, register account information (user name and password) and grant privileges (allow video distribution only, allow camera control, etc.). The same authority is given to all authorized users, therefore it is necessary to be careful to give authority to authorized users. Regularly review and manage the authorized users, and set the minimum necessary authorization level and users. It is important to disable all the authorities of the guest users, which is described later, when wanting to restrict access to only authorized users. Unless these are disabled, access from the guest users will not be restricted. "Guest Users" Guest user means a guest account which does not need a user name and password. By enabling authorities for the guest users, anyone will be able to access the camera without requiring user authentication. Also, this would allow camera control and video distribution commands without authentication. Therefore, guest users authority should be set only when security is ensured, for example, if used within the network that prohibits the external access, etc., otherwise disable all authority of the guest users. When allowing access by guest users, grant only the minimum necessary privileges to them, since the same privileges are given to all guest users, just as to all the authorized users. User management is set on the camera's Settings Page (P. 72). Measures Suitable to the Users' Environment 2: Host Access Restrictions By specifying the hosts that can access the camera, the risk of unauthorized access can be reduced. In order to restrict hosts to access the camera, allow communication with only specified hosts, and prohibit all other communication. Oppositely, there is also the method of prohibiting communication with specified hosts and allowing communication with all others. Depending on the user's environment, the range of access restriction can be grouped on a network basis, or it can be set for each host. However, if mistakenly setting the administrator's IP address to prohibit communication, access from the administrator to the camera will be prohibited and there will be no other way than to restore to the factory default settings. Caution is needed when setting the access restrictions. Host access restrictions are set on the camera's Settings Page (P. 74). Measures Suitable to the Users' Environment 3: Setting to the Digest Authentication When accessing the cameras via [HTTP Server] and [RTP Server], select [Digest Authentication] for the authentication method. When [Basic Authentication] is selected, the password can be easily leaked to unauthorized parties because the password will be sent on the network without being encrypted. It is necessary to set the authentication method of the HTTP Server and the RTP Server respectively. Authentication method is set on the camera's Settings Page respectively (P. 56, 57). Confirm that the application supports the Digest Authentication. 116 Measures Suitable to the Users' Environment 4: Changing the Port Number It is important to limit unspecified access to prevent unauthorized access to the camera. The port number is an entrance to the communication between the camera and the external device, and a number is set for each communication protocol. A common number is used for the port number and network devices can be connected easily. Thus, there is a risk of it being used for intrusion by unauthorized parties. In case there is a need to change the port number due to concern of security, make sure that the port numbers are not redundant with those of other communication protocols, and set it within the specified range. If the port number is changed, specify the port number in addition to the IP address in order to access the camera. Example: Changing the Port Number When connecting by the HTTPS, set "https://{Camera's IP address}:{Port Number}". When the HTTPS port number is changed to 10443 https://192.168.100.1:10443 HTTP Port Numbers/HTTPS Port Numbers HTTP/HTTPS port number is set on the camera's Settings Page (P. 56) It is also possible to change the following port numbers: (cid:129) RTSP Port (P. 57) (cid:129) Multicast Port (P. 57) Measures Suitable to the Users' Environment 5: Encrypting Communication In order to securely communicate between the camera and the external device, it is recommended that all communication be via HTTPS connection (encrypted communication combining SSL/TLS and HTTP). SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a technology to encrypt communication on the network and prevent hacking and tampering of communication contents by an unauthorized party. Even if the data is hacked during communication, by encrypting the communication in the proper way, the contents of the data are protected and safety can be secured. Self-Signed Certificate and Server Certificate To encrypt communication via HTTPS connection, use a self-signed certificate or a server certificate issued from a CA (Certificate Authority). Self-signed certificates are sufficient to do encryption, however, a warning screen will be displayed in the web browser, and there is a risk of impersonation. Therefore, it is advised to use it in the cases for an operation test and others. It is recommended to acquire and install a server certificate issued from CA for a full-scale system operation. Encrypting communications by HTTPS connection is set on the camera's Settings Page (P. 71). Note Even setting the HTTPS connection as mentioned above, the video delivered via RTP/RTSP cannot be encrypted (SRT delivery can be encrypted). In order to securely communicate the video to deliver, it is necessary to deal with the whole system. Measures Suitable to the Users' Environment 6: Disabling Unused Functions The camera has functions to support various purposes and network environments. However, unless those functions are properly set, there is a risk of unauthorized access from outside parties. In order to use the camera safely, it is also necessary to disable the setting of unused functions. The following describes the functions that need to be addressed in the operating environment and usage situation, such as enabling only the necessary functions or disabling the functions after the setting is completed. AutoIP When [AutoIP] (P. 60) is enabled, even in environments where there is no DHCP server, IPv4 link-local addresses (169.254.xxx.xxx) are assigned to the camera. Therefore, by assigning a computer to the same network as the IPv4 address and using the Camera Search Tool, the camera can be detected and initial settings can be made. 117 Although [AutoIP] is enabled by factory default settings, it is recommended to disable [AutoIP] when the initial setting of the network is completed so that it will not be used for unauthorized purposes. mDNS (multicast Domain Name System) [mDNS] (P. 61) is a function to notify devices on the network of the camera IP address and host name information simultaneously so that the camera can be detected even in an environment without a DNS server. In the factory default settings, the setting of [mDNS] is enabled, but to prevent unauthorized use by third parties, disable it after the initial network settings are completed. Wireless LAN [Wireless LAN] (P. 62) allows users to access and operate the camera directly. If it is unnecessary to connect the camera to a computer or mobile device using a Wireless LAN, set [Wireless LAN] to [Disable]. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) By using [RTP Server] (P. 57), video and audio data can be delivered to the specified multicast address. It is recommended to set [RTP] to [Disable] when the devices connecting to the camera do not require RTP protocol. Standard Communication (IP), NDI|HX, RTMP, Output Tracking Data, SRT When using [Standard Communication (IP)], [NDI|HX], [RTMP], [Output Tracking Data] and [SRT], it is possible to distribute videos using each protocol or operate the camera. (P. 64) If it is unnecessary to connect the camera to a device using these protocols, set each item to [Disable]. Important (cid:129) [Video Distribution] under the [User Authority] (P. 73) is not reflected to the RTP. (cid:129) When using NDI|HX, RTMP or SRT, access control is disabled from the [User Management] (P. 72). Precautions When Disposing the Camera When disposing the camera, initialize the camera and delete all setting information such as network settings and administrator account. For camera initialization, refer to Settings Page (P. 82). When disposing the camera, set [Network Settings] to [Do not save]. If unable to access the Settings Page, use the RESET switch on the camera to restore to the factory default settings. Encrypting Backup Information The backup information of the camera settings is used when restoring the camera to the user's previously saved settings. It is possible to manage the backup information more securely by setting [Encryption Password] for the backup information. Handle the set password with care. Backup information encryption is set on the camera's Settings Page (P. 84). 118 Index Access Point ...................................................... 62 Face Detection AF
