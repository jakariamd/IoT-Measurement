Avoid dropping it or subjecting it to strong impact. ● Never bring the camera near magnets, motors, or other devices that generate strong electromagnetic fields, which may cause malfunction or erase image data. ● If water droplets or dirt adheres to the camera or screen, wipe with a dry soft cloth, such as an eyeglass cloth. Do not rub hard or apply force. ● Never use cleaners containing organic solvents to clean the camera or screen. ● Use a blower brush to remove dust from the lens. If cleaning is difficult, contact a Canon Customer Support Help Desk. ● To prevent condensation from forming on the camera after sudden temperature changes (when the camera is transferred from cold to warm environments), put the camera in an airtight, resealable plastic bag and let it gradually adjust to the temperature before removing it from the bag. ● If condensation does form on the camera, stop using it immediately. Continuing to use the camera in this state may damage it. Remove the battery pack and memory card, and wait until the moisture has evaporated before resuming use. ● Store unused battery packs in a plastic bag or other container. To maintain battery performance if you will not use the battery pack for some time, about once a year charge it and then use the camera until it runs out of power before storing the battery pack.

Use of wireless functions is restricted in some countries and regions, and illegal use may be punishable under national or local regulations. To avoid violating wireless regulations, visit the Canon website to check where use is allowed. Note that Canon cannot be held liable for any problems arising from wireless function use in other countries and regions. ● Doing any of the following may incur legal penalties: - Altering or modifying the product - Removing the certification labels from the product ● Before goods or technologies in the camera regulated by the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act are exported (which includes bringing them outside Japan or showing them to non-residents in Japan), export or service transaction permission may be required from the Japanese government. ● Because this product includes American encryption items, it falls under U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and cannot be exported to or brought into a country under U.S. trade embargo. ● Be sure to make notes of the Wi-Fi settings you use. The wireless settings saved to this product may change or be erased due to incorrect operation of the product, the effects of radio waves or static electricity, or accident or malfunction. Please note that Canon accepts no responsibility for direct or indirect damages or loss of earnings resulting from a degradation or disappearance of content. ● When transferring ownership, disposing of the product, or sending it for repair, restore the default wireless settings by erasing any settings you have entered. ● Canon will not make compensation for damages resulting from loss or theft of the product. Canon accepts no responsibility for damages or loss resulting from unauthorized access or use of target devices registered on this product due to loss or theft of the product. ● Be sure to use the product as directed in this guide. Be sure to use the wireless function of this product within the guidelines noted in this guide. Canon accepts no responsibility for damages or loss if the function and product are used in ways other than as described in this guide. ● Do not use the wireless function of this product near medical equipment or other electronic equipment. Use of the wireless function near medical equipment or other electronic equipment may affect operation of those devices. Radio Wave Interference Precautions ● This product may receive interference from other devices that emit radio waves. To avoid interference, be sure to use this product as far away as possible from such devices, or avoid using the devices at the same time as this product. Security Precautions Because Wi-Fi uses radio waves to transmit signals, security precautions more stringent than when using a LAN cable are required. Keep the following points in mind when using Wi-Fi. ● Only use networks you are authorized to use. This product searches for Wi-Fi networks in the vicinity and displays the results on the screen. Networks you are not authorized to use (unknown networks) may also be displayed. However, attempting to connect to or using such networks could be regarded as unauthorized access. Be sure to use only networks you are authorized to use, and do not attempt to connect to other unknown networks. If security settings have not been properly set, the following problems may occur. ● Transmission monitoring Third parties with malicious intent may monitor Wi-Fi transmissions and attempt to acquire the data you are sending. 217 Camera BasicsAuto Mode /Hybrid Auto ModeOther Shooting ModesP ModeTv, Av, M, and C ModePlayback ModeWireless FeaturesSetting MenuAccessoriesAppendixBefore UseBasic GuideAdvanced GuideIndex ● Unauthorized network access Third parties with malicious intent may gain unauthorized access to the network you are using to steal, modify, or destroy information. Additionally, you could fall victim to other types of unauthorized access such as impersonation (where someone assumes an identity to gain access to unauthorized information) or springboard attacks (where someone gains unauthorized access to your network as a springboard to cover their tracks when infiltrating other systems). To prevent these types of problems from occurring, be sure to thoroughly secure your Wi-Fi network. Only use this camera's Wi-Fi function with a proper understanding of Wi-Fi security, and balance risk and convenience when adjusting security settings.
