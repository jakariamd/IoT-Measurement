Tokenization: Anonymizes PII by replacing it with random tokens when datasets are uploaded to the contributor node 2. Hashing: Protects PII by hashing (one-way, non reversible encryption)-original PII is not stored 3. Slicing: Distributes hash fragments across a distributed computing network 4. Matching: Provides a matching service to link identities across different contributor nodes, without disclosing data or putting it at risk of misuse 5. Governance: Performs these matches according to data exchange governance within Data Republic's Senate Platform 6. Auditable: Functions in a transparent and verifiable way so that analysts and custodians can build trust in the system, the data, and with each other Comparing methods for PII management The old way Custodian's database (CRM or EDW) contains customer PII data that must be protected The new way with senate matching The central data store is able to match customer records from multiple contributors Matched customer tokens are used by an analyst to link datasets Custodian's database (CRM or EDW) contains customer PII data that must be protected Senate Matching Contributor Node hashes the PII so that the original text is unrecoverable Hash values are sliced into parts and stored in a distributed network No single company can match or re-identify customer data Matched customer tokens are used by an analyst to link datasets Senate matching process Your org's environment The matcher network Customer database Contributor node Decentralized Network Aggregator node Aggregator node Custodian approves match request. The Matcher network sends their list of matches to the Aggregator Node, which sends decrypted tokens. The node returns the random tokens to the data custodian. After logging into the DR's Senate Platform Attribute data uploaded Data license + match approved Match Discovery workspace Anonymized data Custodian sends anonymized data to Senate by substituting any identifying information with the random token generated by their Contributor Node Thank you!
