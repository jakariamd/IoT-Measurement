MSPA Allowlisted Certified Vendor Certified Vendor with Restrictions Approved EU Vendor Approved on Reserved Ad Server, GAM & DSP Approved on Reserved Ad Server, GAM, DSP & Native/Gemini Ad Platforms Approved on DSP & Native/Gemini Ad Platform Approved on Reserved Ad Server Ad Platform and GAM Approved on One Video (1V) Ad Platform for O&O Publishers Approved on DSP Ad Platform Approved on DSP & One Video (1V) Third Party Vendors The Certification Program at Yahoo is a series of checks run against all new and updated ad creative technologies prior to their first use as part of a campaign. This process includes business evaluation, technology compatibility testing, completion of our standard legal agreement and updates to our tools and systems that are all required in order to implement, deliver and report against a given creative execution. All third party vendor technologies that have been evaluated by this process are listed here with their current certification status. In addition to certification, all vendors operating at Yahoo in the EU are evaluated against criteria established by our legal and policy teams to determine if they meet the minimum standards required to run against users from the EU that are subject to the GDPR legal framework. Vendors that have been approved are listed in this doc with a checkmark under EU Allowlist. EU/EEA validation is separate and distinct from overall vendor certification and is required to run in the EU region regardless of other approvals. If your preferred partner does not appear on this page, please contact your Yahoo Sales Representative for assistance. Please Note: Some publishers have exceptions and do not guarantee the ability to serve all formats and approved technologies. Check with your Yahoo Sales Representative for more details.
