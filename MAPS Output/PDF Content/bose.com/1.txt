Effective date: December 22, 2022 California Privacy Notice of Collection If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") requires us to provide you with the following additional information about: (1) the purpose for which we use each category of "personal information" (as defined in the CCPA) we collect; and (2) the categories of third parties to which we (a) disclose such personal information for a business purpose, (b) "share" personal information for "cross-context behavioral advertising," and/or (c) "sell" such personal information. Under the CCPA, "sharing" is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer's personal information obtained from the consumer's activity across websites, and "selling" is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. We "share" information to provide more relevant and tailored advertising to you regarding our Services. While we do not disclose our customer's personal information to third parties in exchange for money, our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a "sale" under the CCPA.
