</h3><p>  Personal information (also called personal data) is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you. Examples include a name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, Internet activity, and geolocation data. Information that is deidentified or publicly available is not considered personal information.
</p></div> <div><h3>  What personal information does Cox collect and why do we collect it?
</h3><p>  In our <a href="/aboutus/policies/annual-privacy-notice.html#infoWeCollect" target="_blank"> Privacy Notice </a>, we describe the personal information that we collect. Generally, we collect personal information that helps us manage your accounts and services, create and deliver a great customer experience, and market and advertise our services. The specific information we collect depends on the nature of your relationship with us. We collect personal information directly from you as well as from third-party vendors and service providers, including data providers.
</p></div> <div><h3>  I never had Cox services. Do you have my personal information?

</h3><p>  If you never had Cox services, we may still have personal information about you or your household. Typically, this would be demographic information that we collect from third-party vendors and service providers that we use to market our services to you. We also collect information about visitors to our websites, whether or not they are our customers.
</p></div> <div><h3>  How do I find out what personal information you have about me? 
</h3><p>  If you would like to know what personal information we have about you, you can submit a request as described above. Please note that due to technical limitations on how our systems function, if you have lived at more than one address in a Cox service area in the last 12 months, you will need to submit a separate request for a Personal Information Report for each address. We take the protection of your data seriously and will need to take steps to verify your identity before providing your personal information.
</p></div> <div><h3>  Is there a cost to request a Personal Information Report?
</h3><p>  No, there’s no cost. However, if your request is unreasonable or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a fee or refuse your request. 
</p></div> <div><h3>  I’m having trouble making a request through the website. What should I do?

</h3><p>  We’re here to help. Please call <a href="tel:8006990885" target="_blank"> (800)-699-0885 </a> (service hours are Monday-Friday, 11 a.m. - 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, except holidays).</p></div> <div><h3>  What is the difference between submitting an opt-out request and updating my communication preferences?
</h3><p>  An "opt out" request prevents some transfers of personal information to third parties, some of which relate to advertising; however, a customer who opts out may still receive marketing materials directly from Cox.  If you are no longer interested in receiving marketing communications from Cox, current and former customers can update their communication preferences in <a href="https://www.cox.com/content/dam/cox/okta/signin.html?onsuccess=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cox.com%2Fwebapi%2Fcdncache%2Fcookieset%3Fresource%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.cox.com%2Fresaccount%2Fhome.html" target="_blank"> My Account </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Why can't I use my cox.net email to receive a verification code?
</h3><p>  Cox takes your data privacy seriously. For added security, we do not send verification codes  to cox.net email addresses. Customers may add an additional email address or mobile number to their My Account profile to receive verification codes, but codes sent to the added contact address or number cannot immediately be used. These measures are in place for account security purposes.
