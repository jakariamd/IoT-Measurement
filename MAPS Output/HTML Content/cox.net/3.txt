</p></p> <div><h2>  Information We Collect and Use

</h2><p>  Generally, we collect and use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you services and as otherwise related to the operation of our business, as detailed below.

<b> Your Personally Identifiable Information </b>
In providing our Subscription Services, we sometimes collect personally identifiable information, such as name, service and mailing addresses, telephone numbers, social security number, driver’s license number, email address, billing and payment records (including credit card and bank account numbers used to pay for our services), subscriber credit information, or other information that could be used to identify, authenticate, contact, or locate you (“<b> Personally Identifiable Information </b>” or “<b> PII </b>”). We may also collect demographic and usage information about you and other subscribers such as information about premium services, location, demographics, the services you have chosen to receive, information about equipment and devices connected to our cable system and network, complaint information, including customer correspondence and communications records, and information regarding maintenance, repairs, services, equipment, software, usage, settings and preferences to aid in customer support and in recommendations for you. If you visit one of our facilities, we may also capture your image on our security cameras.

</p></div> <p><p>  We may combine Personally Identifiable Information with demographic and other information for purposes consistent with this Notice. To the extent such other information is directly linked to Personally Identifiable Information, it will be considered Personally Identifiable Information. We and third parties may create aggregate, pseudonymous, and/or deidentified information (i.e., information from which personally identifiable elements have been removed or modified), which is not considered Personally Identifiable Information in this Notice.
 </p></p> <p><p>  <b> Cox TV Services </b>
We may use various technologies, including the cable set-top box, our websites, and our mobile and TV applications, to collect information about your Subscription Services video selections and activities, such as information about the TV shows and channels your household watches on different devices (“<b> TV Viewing Information </b>”). Additional Personally Identifiable Information is collected in providing some types of television services, such as pay-per view, interactive, entertainment-on-demand and devices we provide to you and we may disclose it as set forth in the "<a href="#disclosures" target="_blank"> Disclosure </a>" section below. We collect TV Viewing Information to help us provide our services to you and to provide us with a better understanding of how different networks, channels and shows are performing. We may use TV Viewing Information to make recommendations to you and for other service-related purposes, such as to market new or additional services to you. On the most recent version of our set-top box and in our TV app, we provide an option for you to opt-out of video recommendations based on your TV Viewing Information through the settings menu.</p></p> <p><p>  
We may combine TV Viewing Information with other information for purposes consistent with this Notice. To the extent that TV Viewing Information or other information is linked directly with Personally Identifiable Information, it will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information under this Notice. Also, we may disclose this TV Viewing Information that is not directly linked to Personally Identifiable Information as set forth in the "<a href="#disclosure" target="_blank"> Disclosure </a>" section below. 
 </p></p> <p><p>  For more information on our privacy practices related to the Cox TV Services, see the "<a href="#cableTvAct" target="_blank"> Cable Television Act Protection of Subscriber Privacy </a>” section below. 

<b> Internet Services </b>
Like most Internet service providers, we automatically collect and store Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (an identifier given to your connection while online), the volume of and types of data transmitted and received through your service, device types used, Internet connection performance, device addresses, and connection dates and times. We may also collect and store other usage statistics, such as the volume of data transmitted by certain protocols, devices, usage categories, and services, to help us understand how our network is used, to give you insight into your household Internet usage, and to improve the Subscription Services we offer. We monitor our network and collect telemetry and other data to measure the quality of our Internet service, and to help us troubleshoot and diagnose service issues you are experiencing. We also monitor our network for security, malware, and fraud prevention purposes. If you are accessing the Internet away from your home through a Wi-Fi connection provided by Cox or its partners, we may also collect the device MAC address, device type, location of the access point, duration, and session information.

We may also provide location-based online advertising based on your geographic location. Visit the preferences section in your My Account at <a href="https://www.cox.com" target="_blank"> www.cox.com </a> for more information and to opt out of receiving location-based ads.

<b> Cox Mobile Services </b>
When you use our mobile services, we may collect technical information about the device you are using, such as telephone number, hardware model, operating system, SIM card number, the serial number of your device, and similar device identifiers.  In addition to the device information listed above, we may also collect mobile network usage information from your device that allows us to analyze signal strength, call and data failures, and calling patterns. We may also collect information when you use our mobile application to manage your account, which can include your account number, user ID, device ID, and IP address. We do not collect precise geolocation information through our mobile services without your consent.  In some cases, we may collect details of the products and services you receive from us, such as your mobile device rate plan, so that we can send you account updates or other communications regarding your account or to send you information, recommendations, and promotions that we believe will be of interest to you.

<b> Email and Online Communications </b>
Unless addressed to us or required by law or legal process, we do not read the contents of your online communications, such as email. We may, however, retain and provide such communications if we are legally required to do so. For Cox email accounts, we generally scan incoming and outgoing email traffic electronically to identify and filter likely spam and malicious email, and for security and fraud prevention purposes. We may use email to send transactional, informational, or relationship messages related to your Subscription Services. If you prefer, you may opt-out of marketing emails to a specific address by notifying us in response to the email you receive, through the "unsubscribe" link found at the bottom of the email.</p></p> <div><p>  
<b> Cox Internet DNS Privacy </b>
</p><p>  The Domain Name System or "DNS" is an integral part of the internet, providing a way to link host names to specific IP addresses. The Cox-provided DNS platform is optimized and configured to help you get the best possible experience from your Internet service. We retain the contents of lookups, or "queries" made to the platform for a period of approximately 5 days.
 </p><p>  The contents of those queries, including timestamps, requested DNS hostname, and source IP address are continually aggregated and used to identify network trends such as growth, anomalous device behavior, malicious activity (botnets, viruses, spam, spyware, etc.) and potentially damaging traffic such as DoS (Denial of Service) activity. We do not disclose DNS data with any third party except in limited instances where anonymized or aggregated data is necessary for cybersecurity, DNS analytics, reporting, or research purposes. Following aggregation, the retained or transferred data does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information or data that we believe could be combined or correlated with Personally Identifiable Information to identify a user or their behavior. Cox does not use customer DNS query information to facilitate advertising, either internally or via third party advertisers.</p></div> <p><p>  
<b> Telephone Services </b>
In providing telephone services, we collect usage information, including calls made and received and their duration. We treat this information as private as required by applicable law. We monitor and record calls with Cox customer care agents for quality, training, and analytics purposes.
</p></p> <div><p>  <b> Interest-Based Content Suggestions and Advertising </b>
</p><p>  We
 may combine TV Viewing Information with additional information we 
obtain from other sources, including, for example, from public 
databases, advertisers, and data providers, so we can tailor advertising
 to make it more relevant to your household and to improve its 
effectiveness, and to offer you content suggestions. If you prefer that 
we not show you targeted ads, you can opt-out by visiting the 
preferences center in My Account at <a href="https://www.cox.com" target="_blank"> www.cox.com </a>.
 Please note, if you opt-out you will still receive TV advertising from 
Cox, but it will be generic and not targeted to your household’s 
interests.</p></div> <p><p>  When watching Cox TV and 
using Cox Internet for activities such as watching online videos, 
listening to podcasts, or browsing the web, advertisers want to show you
 advertising for their products and services that are tailored to your 
household. To show you more relevant TV advertising when watching Cox 
TV, we combine subscriber information, such as your name and address, 
and TV Viewing Information, with commercially available information such
 as age, gender, preferred language, and general interests obtained from
 third-party sources, including, for example, from public databases, 
advertisers, and data companies. We do not provide this type of tailored
 advertising based upon TV Viewing Information that personally 
identifies you and we do not share information that directly identifies 
you with these advertisers. For more relevant advertising when you are 
online, we combine subscriber information, such as your name and 
address, with commercially available information obtained from 
third-party sources. We do not use your Cox Internet usage data with any
 tailored advertising, and we do not share information that directly 
identifies you with these advertisers.
 </p></p> <p><p>  If
 you prefer that we not use your subscriber information to show you 
tailored online or television ads for products or services offered by 
companies other than Cox, you can opt-out by visiting the preferences 
center in My Account at <a href="https://www.cox.com" target="_blank"> www.cox.com </a>.
 Please note, if you opt-out you will still receive advertising from 
these advertisers, but it will be generic and not tailored by us to your
 household.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Cox Homelife </b>
Home
 security and automation services offered by Cox are subject to this 
Notice and the terms, conditions and privacy provisions contained in the
 applicable home security service agreement. If you subscribe to Cox 
Homelife Care, we collect Personally Identifiable Information about you 
or the individual utilizing the Cox Homelife Care services.

<b> Communicating with You </b>
We
 may communicate with you online, including in browser notifications, 
concerning maintenance, security, and fraud prevention issues, as well 
as information from Cox that you may be interested in. If you prefer, 
you may opt-out of marketing emails to a specific email address through 
the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of the email. We may send 
communications through text messages to the extent you have opted in or 
as permitted by law.</p></p> <div><h2>  Disclosures

<b> Cox TV Services </b>
We disclose TV Viewing Information we collect with TV networks and with companies that help advertisers make decisions on where to place their ads. When we disclose TV Viewing Information, we never include your name, address, email address, or phone number or other contact information that personally identifies you, rather we use a unique identifier. If you prefer that we not disclose your household TV Viewing Information with third parties other than those needed to help us provide our Subscription Services to you, including for the purpose of serving more relevant ads, you can opt-out by visiting the preferences center in My Account at <a href="https://www.cox.com" target="_blank"> www.cox.com </a>.

<b> Telephone Services </b>
</p></p> <p><p>  We do not disclose the telephone usage information we collect, such as records of calls made and received and their duration, unless required by law or legal process. 
 </p></p> <p><p>  Our telephone customers can designate their listings as non-published for print or electronic directories or for directory assistance services. We do not publish these directories and are not responsible for their content or accuracy. Because of the complexity of this process and the involvement of others, errors sometimes occur. Our telephone services are subject to tariff or contractual terms that limit our liability in the event of listing errors.
 </p></p> <p><p>  For more information on telephone privacy, see the “<a href="#security" target="_blank"> Security </a>” section and the "<a href="#customerProprietaryInfo" target="_blank"> Customer Proprietary Network Information </a>" section below.

<b> Cox Mobile Services </b>
We disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized. Where appropriate, Cox may also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with vendors and business partners working on our behalf to help us provide you with our products or services.  Further, when processing your application and determining your eligibility for our services, we may also disclose limited personal information about your account and your mobile device with our service providers to assist with identity verification, and to prevent fraud and identity theft. For example, this may also include disclosing your information with an insurance provider if you elect to insure your mobile device through our mobile protection plan.
<b> 
 Internet Services and Email </b>
</p></p> <p><p>  We may disclose network traffic data, including IP addresses, with trusted third parties who work to protect ISPs and the Internet from botnets and other threats. We may also publicly publish city- and state-level location information associated with our IP addresses, making this information available to businesses that provide services for mapping IP addresses with general geographic data.
 </p></p> <p><p>  We do not disclose the contents of your online communications, including emails, unless required by law or legal process. We may retain and provide such communications to others if we are legally required or compelled to do so. For the email accounts that are provided by us, we scan incoming and outgoing email traffic electronically to identify and filter out likely spam and messages for security and fraud prevention purposes.</p></p> <div><p>  
<b> Special Exceptions </b>
</p><p>  We reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or legal process; (2) protect our network, rights, or property or those of others; (3) respond to fraud, abuse or unauthorized reception or access; (4) enforce our Policies posted on cox.com; or (5) act in an emergency to protect your safety or that of another person. See also the "<a href="#lawEnforcement" target="_blank"> Law Enforcement and Legal Requests </a>" section below. We may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information as follows: with your consent, as explained at the time of collection, or as otherwise not prohibited by applicable law and not inconsistent with this Notice or any notice given by us at the time of collection. Further, we may disclose and/or transfer Personally Identifiable Information in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing of our business, or merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of Cox assets, or transfer of all or a portion of Cox’s business to another company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding.
 </p></div> <p><p>  We may also disclose your Subscription Services Personally Identifiable Information to you or your authorized users or agents upon request, however, we take reasonable precautions to identify you, or persons you have authorized, when we are contacted about your Cox account before doing so.</p></p> <p><p>  
<b> Vendors </b>
We use vendors in providing Subscription Services to you and may disclose Personally Identifiable Information with them for these purposes, including billing, collection, account management, customer support, marketing, and other routine business purposes. We contractually require these vendors to maintain reasonable security of Personally Identifiable Information they process for us and to abide by applicable laws.
</p></p> <div><h2>  Law Enforcement and Legal Requests

</h2><p>  <b> Information We Must Disclose </b>
We routinely receive legal requests for customer information from government and law enforcement personnel. We also receive discovery requests in civil cases. We cooperate by providing the information required by law or as compelled by legal process. Cox does not volunteer Subscription Services Personally Identifiable Information, including access to customer communications, to law enforcement or others, except as noted in the "<a href="#disclosures" target="_blank"> Special Exceptions </a>" detailed in the “<a href="#disclosures" target="_blank"> Disclosure </a>” section above, or as otherwise disclosed in the Notice or at the point of collection (e.g., to our vendors in connection with their provision of services to us). Many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or notify you of the request. Due to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we do not assume any duty to notify you of receipt of any legal requests. The following applies to certain types of your Subscription Services Personally Identifiable Information that may be the subject of law enforcement or legal request:

<b> Internet Information </b>
We sometimes receive subpoenas for your identity in connection with use of your Internet service for apparent copyright infringement or other civil matters. Files shared over “peer-to-peer” services often include your IP address, and if we receive a subpoena, we will provide the Personally Identifiable Information associated with that IP address to the extent required by law. Law enforcement can also obtain your Subscription Services Personally Identifiable Information, including details about your Internet use and the content of communications, from us through a warrant or similar authority. 

<b> Telephone Information </b>
Law enforcement must obtain a warrant or other similar authority to use a telephone wiretap or a device to capture dialing information. Law enforcement, and others, can also subpoena or otherwise compel us through legal process to provide your Personally Identifiable Information, including your telephone account and call record information.

<b> TV Programming Selections </b>
Television programming selections linked to your Personally Identifiable Information may generally be obtained from us by third parties only under court order and after notice is sent to you and you are given the opportunity to object in court. For more information on cable television privacy, see the <a href="#cableTvAct" target="_blank"> Cable Television Act Protection of Subscriber Privacy </a> section below.

<b> Child Pornography </b>
We work closely with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other groups to eliminate child pornography on the Internet. The law requires us to report any evidence of apparent child pornography and we may share your Personally Identifiable Information in connection therewith.
</p></div> <div><h2>  Third-Party Services

</h2><p>  Our Subscription Services may include or link to third-party websites, applications, ads, locations, platforms, code (e.g., plug-ins, application programming interfaces ("<b> API </b>"), and software development kits ("<b> SDKs </b>")), or other services ("<b> Third-Party Service(s) </b>"). These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personally Identifiable Information and other data from you.
 </p></div> <p><p>  Third-Party Services include third-party content provider applications and links that enable you to access Third-Party Services via our Subscription Services ("<b> Content Services </b>"). When you access those Third-Party Services in this manner, you are interacting directly with the Third-Party Service even if you have not closed out of our Subscription Services. Examples include when you access any of the following content providers’ services while on our Subscription Services: Netflix, Pandora, Amazon Prime Video, and other third-party applications providing content. In addition, when accessing content networks directly via our Subscription Services, the content network programmers ("<b> Third-Party Networks </b>") may use SDKs and other technologies to directly collect information from and about you, in which case they are acting as Third-Party Services providers. Third-Party Services may also include third-party audience measurement services, including but not limited to Nielsen’s measurement software that is used for market research. More information about Nielsen’s measurement software and your choices regarding Nielsen’s measurement is available at <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy" target="_blank"> http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy </a>.
 </p></p> <p><p>  In addition, certain functionalities of our Subscription Services permit interactions that you initiate between our Subscription Services and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (“<b> Social Features </b>”). Examples of Social Features include: “liking” or “sharing” Cox’s content; logging in to our Subscription Services using your Third-Party Service account (e.g., using Facebook Connect to sign-in to our service); and to otherwise connect our Subscription Services to a Third-Party Service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the service). If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on our Subscription Services or by the Third-Party Service that you use.
 </p></p> <p><p>  When you use Third-Party Services, including Social Features, Content Services and Third-Party Networks, Cox is merely facilitating your access to those services, and you are subject to the data collection and use practices and privacy policies of the Third-Party Services and Cox is not responsible for their data practices. Cox encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.</p></p> <div><h2>  Security

</h2><p>  <b> Taking Proper Precautions Online </b>
Maintaining the security of your personal computer is an important way to protect your privacy and to help us protect our network and customers. Following our policies posted on www.cox.com and maintaining your antivirus software, firewall, wireless network security, and your operating system can help prevent harm and potential theft of data. You should regularly back up your computer to preserve your files, including messages you want to keep, and change your login password regularly. Always be sure you know with whom you are dealing before clicking on an Internet link or giving out your personal information. When using the Internet for communications, it is possible for outside parties to access them. Since we cannot control websites or services operated by third parties, you should review their terms of service and privacy policies before use. We may take protective action related to your Internet service or contact you to help with security issues we identify, such as malware infections. Unsecured Wi-Fi home networks can allow unauthorized persons to use your Internet service for illegal activity which can be attributed to your account. We monitor our network and scan incoming and outgoing cox.com email messages to filter out likely spam, harmful messages, viruses, malware, spyware, and related threats that could harm your equipment, the network, or others. Cox will not contact you to ask for your personal information; if you receive a communication from a person asking to be us and asking for personal information, you should contact Cox directly by phone to verify the communication before giving out any personal information.

<b> Spam </b>
We try to block incoming and outgoing spam using a variety of methods. You can help by preventing unauthorized access to your computer and email account. You can forward unwanted spam to <a href="mailto:spamreport@cox.net" target="_blank"> spamreport@cox.net </a> and phishing scams to <a href="mailto:phishingreport@cox.net" target="_blank"> phishingreport@cox.net </a> to help update our filters. We will never ask you to send sensitive personal information to us by unsecured email. 

<b> Telephone Services </b>
Telephone customers must provide a government-issued photo ID or other appropriate identification before we can discuss your information. If you, or anyone authorized by you, make certain changes to your telephone account, Cox will send you notice to confirm that you made these changes. If you suspect that someone may have made unauthorized changes to your account, contact Customer Care at the telephone number on your bill. If we discover any unauthorized access to your telephone account, we will send you notice, in keeping with applicable law.
</p></div> <div><h2>  Children's Privacy

</h2><p>  Our Subscription Services are intended for use by a general audience and account holders must be of the age of majority or emancipated minors. We do not intend to or knowingly collect personal information (as the term is defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13. If you believe your child may have provided us with their personal information, you can contact Cox at <a href="mailto:privacy@cox.com" target="_blank"> privacy@cox.com </a> and we will delete their personal information to the extent required by applicable law.

We intend this Notice to supplement these documents in connection with the Subscription Services.

We will post any changes at cox.com, along with the effective date of the changes, so check the notices center of our website often</p></div> <div><h2>  Our Network Practices

</h2><p>  For more information about our network management practices, please read our Internet Services Disclosures at <a href="/aboutus/policies/internet-service-disclosures.html" target="_blank"> https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/internet-service-disclosures.html </a>.
</p></div> <div><h2>  Customer Proprietary Network Information

</h2><p>  If you subscribe to Cox telephone service or any other Cox service classified as a “telecommunications service,” federal law creates certain additional privacy protections and use restrictions with respect to a category of information known as “customer proprietary network information” or "<b> CPNI </b>." CPNI refers to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of your use of a telecommunications service that is made available to us solely by virtue of our relationship with you, as a customer. CPNI also includes information in your bills pertaining to your telephone service. CPNI does not include subscriber list information, such as your name, address and telephone number or other information that has been published in any directory format, or information that does not identify you personally. Examples of CPNI include information about your phone service found on your monthly telephone bill, the technical characteristics of your Subscription Services, the class of Subscription Services to which you subscribe, your current telephone charges, your long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling records.
 </p></div> <p><p>  You have a right, and we have a duty, under federal law, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI. Cox does not sell your CPNI, and your CPNI will not be disclosed to third parties outside of Cox and our affiliates, agents, joint venture partners, vendors, and independent contractors, except as required by law or detailed here.
 </p></p> <p><p>  We may use your telephone CPNI to offer you our communications-related products or services that may enhance products or services to which you already subscribe. Unless you tell us otherwise within thirty (30) days of your first receipt of this CPNI notice, we may also use your telephone CPNI to offer you communications-related products or services that are outside of the same category of Subscription Services to which you already subscribe. You can grant, restrict, or withdraw the right for us to use your CPNI for these marketing purposes at any time at <a href="https://www.cox.com/privacyrequest" target="_blank"> https://www.cox.com/privacyrequest </a>. When you contact us, we may ask for your consent to use your CPNI in marketing our services to you at that time. This consent applies only for the duration of the call or Internet session. We will not use your CPNI for any other marketing purposes without your permission. Restricting our use of your CPNI will not affect your Subscription Services. If you previously contacted us to approve or deny our use of your CPNI, we will continue to honor your request and you do not need to contact us again.</p></p> <div><h2>  Cable Television Act Protection of Subscriber Privacy

</h2><p>  We consider the privacy of our subscribers to be very important, and we are committed to keeping nonpublic Personally Identifiable Information about our subscribers secure and confidential. Your privacy rights under federal law relating to our cable television services are summarized below:
 </p><ul>  <li>In the course of providing cable television service, as stated above in the "<a href="#infoWeCollect" target="_blank"> Information We Collect and Use </a>" section, we collect and maintain certain Personally Identifiable Information regarding our subscribers for legitimate business activities related to the marketing and providing of services over our cable system and for financial, accounting, fraud prevention, tax and franchise purposes. We may combine the Personally Identifiable Information that we collect about you as part of our regular business records with information about you obtained from third parties to help us identify other services we or our affiliates provide that might interest you. We also may collect TV Viewing Information for any reason, including determining which programs are the most popular, how many people watch a show, and which cable features are used most often.

</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Personally Identifiable Information is confidential and therefore will not be disclosed to third parties unless it is necessary to render or conduct a legitimate business activity related to a cable service or other services provided to you, or to detect unauthorized reception of our services.  The Cable Act allows us to disclose your name and address information – so-called subscriber list information - to third parties for their own marketing purposes, subject to providing you with an opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure. Should we decide in the future to share subscriber list information with third parties for their own marketing purposes, we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out. We may be legally required to release your Personally Identifiable Information to the government or a third party due to a law, court order, subpoena, or other government order or legal process. We also may release your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury or a credible threat to children or public safety requires disclosure. In some situations, we are legally prohibited from providing you with any notification regarding the release of your Personally Identifiable Information.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The types of persons to whom your Personally Identifiable Information may be disclosed in the course of our cable business include employees, agents, affiliates, sales representatives, accountants, attorneys, vendors, billing and collection agencies, program suppliers, and auditors. The frequency of such disclosure will vary depending on our business needs. For example, billing information on past due accounts will be disclosed when collection action is commenced and other information on an as-needed basis. We also may disclose your name and address for purposes permitted by law. Additionally, authorized representatives of the franchising authority and FCC personnel may review service complaint logs maintained by the system which reflect complaints made by the subscribers regarding the quality of cable television reception. Except when required by law, we will not disclose the extent of your viewing or other use of a cable service or other service we provide, nor the nature of any transaction you make over the cable system in a manner that can identify you personally. We follow industry-standard practices to prevent unauthorized access to Personally Identifiable Information; however, we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The information set forth above may be maintained by us for such time as its retention is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or to satisfy other business, legal or tax requirements and there are no pending requests for access to such information from you or pursuant to a legal proceeding. For example, former subscribers’ names, addresses, telephone numbers, billing and payment records and subscription information are maintained for a minimum of three (3) years. Any subscriber may inspect their own Personally Identifiable Information during regular business hours at our local office upon at least three (3) days prior written request. Subscribers will be provided a reasonable opportunity to correct any error in such information. You may also check the accuracy of, and advise on errors with, certain of your Subscription Services Personally Identifiable Information by accessing your My Account at <a href="https://www.cox.com" target="_blank"> www.cox.com </a>. 

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Federal law permits you to bring a civil action in federal court, in addition to any other lawful remedy available to you, for violations of your cable television subscriber privacy rights.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  © 1998 - 2023 Cox Communications, Inc.
