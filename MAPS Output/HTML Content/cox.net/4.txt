 </p><ul>  <li><b> Log Information: </b> 
Log information is data about your use of the Online Service, such as IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.

</li><li><b> Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: </b>  Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods, device and activity monitoring, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“<b> Tracking Technologies </b>”) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Online Service, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.

</li></ul></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Cookies </b>
</li></ul><p>  A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may include session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Online Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help us understand how you use the Online Service and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some features, and functionalities of the Online Service may not work. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. HTML5 cookies are locally stored on your device other than in the browser and browser settings won’t control them. The Online Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices. For more information on how to manage your cookie preferences see <a href="#section10c" target="_blank"> Section 10C </a>.
 
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Embedded Scripts </b>
</li></ul><p>  An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Online Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from Cox’s web server, or from a third party with which Cox works and is active only while you are connected to the Online Service and deleted or deactivated thereafter.
 
</p><ul>  <li><b> Location-identifying Technologies </b>
</li></ul><p>  GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, geo-targeting, geo-fencing, and other location-aware technologies locate you (sometimes precisely), or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location. If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Online Service, your device location may be tracked by us and third parties. For example, our store finder feature may access and use information about your device location (such as based on IP address or GPS, as applicable), or your account information, to suggest appropriate store locations. Our Online Service content may be personalized based on various information we may have about you to try to provide you with more location-relevant content.
 
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Device Recognition Technologies </b>
</li></ul><p>  Certain technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, link a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID) and attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household) ("<b> Cross-device Data </b>").
 
</p><ul>  <li><b> In-App Tracking Methods </b>
</li></ul><p>  There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifiers, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and devices.
 
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Device and Activity Monitoring </b>
</li></ul><p>  Technologies that monitor, and may record, certain of your interactions with the Online Service, including without limitation, keystrokes, and collect and analyze information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes such as identification, security, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, tracking and improving the Online Services and customizing or optimizing your experience on the Online Services.

</p></div> <p><p>  Some information about your use of the Online Service and certain third-party services may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by Cox and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use and deliver relevant ads and other content to you on the Online Service and certain third-party services. See <a href="#section10" target="_blank"> Section 10 </a> regarding certain choices regarding these activities.</p></p> <p><p>  Cox is giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them explained in <a href="#section10" target="_blank"> Section 10 </a> so that your consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> C. </b><b>    </b><b> Information Cox Collects From Other Sources. </b></p></p> <p><p>  Cox may also obtain information about you from other sources, including Vendors and Third-Party Services, and combine that information with PII collected from your use of the Online Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Online Privacy Policy is not intended to limit Cox’s activities regarding such third-party-sourced, or non-Service-sourced, information, and such information will only be treated as PII in accordance with this Online Privacy Policy to the extent it is combined with PII collected by Cox. Cox is not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or for third party policies or practices.</p></p> <div><h2>  2. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we and third parties may convert your PII to non-PII, including without limitation through hashing it or substituting a unique identifier for the PII and we and third parties may use and disclose that data as permitted by applicable law, including to match data attributes to and from other sources. Any such third-party activities are subject to their privacy policies and practices. Cox’s disclosure of PII is, however, subject to the following:
 </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><u> Marketing </u>: We may use your PII to send you marketing communications.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Cox may also disclose any information about you (including, without limitation, PII) for any purposes not inconsistent with this Online Privacy Policy, or our written statements at the point of collection, and otherwise not prohibited by applicable law, including, without limitation, for the following purposes:

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition, Cox may disclose your PII and non-PII, in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing of our business, or merger, purchase, sale, joint venture, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of Cox assets, or transfer of all or a portion of Cox’s business to another company, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding (“<b> Corporate Transactions </b>”)</p></p> <div><h2>  4.

If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including PII, may be disclosed to Cox, co-sponsors, Vendors, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list).

These Third-Party Services may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other Tracking Technology to independently collect information about you and may solicit PII from you.
 </p></div> <p><p>  Certain functionalities on the Online Service permit interactions that you initiate between the Online Service and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (“<b> Social Features </b>”). Examples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Online Service and a Third-Party Service; “liking” or “sharing” Cox’s content; logging in to the Online Service using your Third- Party Service account (<i> e.g., </i> using Facebook Connect to sign in to the Online Service); and to otherwise connect the Online Service to a Third-Party Service (<i> e.g., </i> to pull or push information to or from the Online Service). If you use Social Features and potentially other Third-Party Services, the information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Online Service  or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Online Service (<i> e.g., </i> by using a hashtag associated with Cox or other Cox Affiliates in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Online Service or otherwise by Cox and Cox Affiliates. Also, both Cox and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Online Service and any Third-Party Service. Third-Party Services may also include third-party audience measurement services, including but not limited to Nielsen’s measurement software that is used for market research. More information about Nielsen’s measurement software and your choices regarding Nielsen’s measurement is available at <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy" target="_blank"> http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy </a>.
 </p></p> <p><p>  Cox may engage and work with Vendors and other Third Parties to serve advertisements on the Online Service and/or on third-party services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing of the Online Service and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of precise location and/or Cross-device Data, sometimes referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “online behavioral advertising” (“<b> Online Interest-based Advertising </b>”), which may include sending you an ad on a Third-Party Service after you have left the Online Service (<i> i.e., </i> “retargeting”). Online Interest-based Advertising does not include targeted advertising based on your viewership preferences combined with other related information that may be part of our Subscription Services (“<b> Addressable Advertising </b>”). For more information on Addressable Advertising and your choices regarding it, please see our <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/annual-privacy-notice.html" target="_blank"> Residential Privacy Notice </a>.
 </p></p> <p><p>  Cox may use Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics or other Vendors for analytics services. These analytics services may use cookies and other Tracking Technologies to help Cox analyze Online Service users and how they use the Online Service. Information generated by these services (<i> e.g., </i> your IP address and other Usage Information) may be transmitted to and stored by these Vendors and/or third parties on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere) and these Vendors and/or third parties may use this information for purposes such as evaluating your use of the Online Service, compiling statistic reports on the Online Service’s activity, and providing other services relating to Online Service activity and other Internet usage.
 </p></p> <p><p>  Cox is not responsible for, and makes no representations regarding, the policies or business practices of any third parties, including, without limitation, analytics Vendors and Third-Party Services associated with the Online Service, and encourages you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. See <a href="#section10" target="_blank"> Section 10 </a> for more on certain choices offered by some third parties regarding their data collection and use, including regarding Online Interest-based Advertising and analytics.</p></p> <div><h2>  6. DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING

</h2><p>  Cox takes reasonable measures to protect 
Cox-Collected Online PII (excluding public UGC) from loss, theft, misuse
 and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 
Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet and online digital storage 
are not completely secure and Cox does not guarantee the security of 
your information collected through the Online Service.</p><p>  To
 help protect you and others, Cox and its Service Providers may (but 
make no commitment to) monitor use of the Online Service, and may 
collect and use related information including Cox-Collected Online PII

transactions; prevent abuse of, and investigate and/or seek prosecution 
for, any potential threats to or misuse of the Online Service; ensure 
compliance with the <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/online-terms-of-use.html" target="_blank"> Online Terms of Use </a>

these documents; improve the Online Services and your Online Services 
experiences, and to protect the rights and property of Cox Affiliates, 
third parties, and other users. Monitoring may result in the collection,
 recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through 
our Online Service. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must 
discontinue your use of the Online Service.</p></div> <div><h2>  7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

</h2><p>  Cox is based in the U.S. and the information Cox and its Service

European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and/or Switzerland, 
please note that Cox does not intend to offer goods and services 
(including the Online Services) to EU, EEA, or Swiss individuals. If you
 are accessing the Online Service from outside of the U.S., please be 
aware that information collected through the Online Service may be 
transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. Data protection 
laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of 
residence. Your use of the Online Service or provision of any 
information therefore constitutes your consent to the transfer to and 
from, processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information, 
including PII, in the U.S. as set forth in this Online Privacy Policy.</p></div> <div><h2>  8. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Cox does not intend to collect personal information as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("<b> COPPA </b>") (<b> "Children’s Personal Information" </b>) in a manner that is not permitted by COPPA. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Children’s Personal Information in a manner not permitted by COPPA, we will remove such data to the extent required by COPPA.</p></div> <p><p>  California Minors have certain additional rights detailed in our <a href="https://www.cox.com/aboutus/policies/state-privacy-notices/ca-general-privacy-notice.html#minors" target="_blank"> California Consumer Privacy Notice. </a></p></p> <div><h2>  9.

Cox will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in Cox’s then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from Cox’s databases (California minors see <a href="#section8" target="_blank"> Section 8 </a>) and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. Further, we reserve the right to retain data (a) as required by applicable law; and (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p></div> <div><h2>  10. CHOICES: TRACKING AND COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS

</h2><p>  <b> A. </b><b>    </b><b> Tracking Technologies Generally. </b>
Browser cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options, so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Online Service may not work and that when you revisit the Online Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

Some app-related Tracking Technologies can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to digital platforms or other online services you visit. Like many online services, Cox currently does not alter Cox’s practices when Cox receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.</p></div> <p><p>  <b> B. </b><b>    </b><b> Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies. </b>

Some of the third parties and Vendors that perform advertising-related services for us related to our Online Service and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Online Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank"> aboutads.info/choices/ </a>, and <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank"> youradchoices.com/appchoices </a> for information on the DAA’s opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("<b> NAI </b>").

Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Online Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Online Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (<i> e.g., </i> from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non- browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may no longer be effective.
