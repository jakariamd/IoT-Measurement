<div><h1>  Privacy policy</h1><p>  What personal information we collect and why.</p></div> <div><h2>  Our handy summary
</h2><p>  We are under a legal obligation to let you know what personal information we collect about you, what we use it for and on what basis. We always need a good reason and we also have to explain to you your rights in relation to that information. You have the right to know what information we hold about you and to have a copy of it, and you can ask us to change or sometimes delete it. This has been written in line with our obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 and the Data Protection Act 2018 as they apply in the UK. There may be local law requirements within and outside the EU which apply instead.</p></div> <p><p>  The reasons we collect information are set out in this privacy policy, but we are not telling you all this just because we have to. As a communications provider, most of what we do – from connecting calls to developing and promoting our services – involves using personal information. And we believe that it is very important for our customers to trust us with that information. We want you to be confident that we will keep it secure and use it both lawfully and ethically, respecting your privacy.</p></p> <p><p>  Our support for the right to privacy, as part of our broader commitment to human rights, is stated in our <a href="https://www.bt.com/about/digital-impact-and-sustainability/championing-human-rights/privacy-and-free-expression" target="_blank"> human rights policy </a>. And our privacy policy explains in detail how we use your personal information. It describes what we do (or what we may do) from the moment you ask for a service from us, when we may use your information for credit-checking purposes, through to providing and billing for that service. It also applies to marketing other products that we think will interest you.</p></p> <p><p>  But whatever we do with your information, we need a legal basis for doing it. We generally rely on one of three grounds (reasons) for our business processing. Firstly, if you have ordered or take a service from us, we are entitled to process your information so that we can provide that service to you and bill you for it.</p></p> <p><p>  Secondly, if we want to collect and use your information for other purposes, we may need to ask for your consent (permission) and, if we do, that permission must always be indicated by a positive action from you (such as ticking a box) and be informed. You are also free to withdraw your permission at any time. We tend to need permission when what is proposed is more intrusive (for example, sharing your contact details with other organisations so they can market their own products and services to you).</p></p> <p><p>  But we do not always need permission. In some cases, having assessed whether our use would be fair and not override your right to privacy, we may come to the view that it falls within the third ground – our ‘legitimate interests’ to use the information in a particular way without your permission (for example, to protect our network against cyber-attacks). But when we do this, we must tell you as you may have a right to object. And if you object specifically to us sending you marketing material, or to ‘profiling you’ for marketing purposes, we must then stop. </p></p> <p><p>  This is all set out in detail in this policy, which focuses more on those items that we think are likely to be of most interest to you. As well as covering processing for business purposes, we give you information on circumstances in which we may have to, or can choose to, share your information.</p></p> <div><h2>  Our privacy policy
</h2><p>  As a straight talking provider we want you to understand why we need to collect personal information, how we use that information and to feel confident we’ll protect it.</p><p>  We’ve tried to set this out as simply as possible below.</p><p>  It applies to the products and services we provide (like phone, mobile, WiFi, TV, broadband and email), browsing our website and if you are a member of the <a href="https://community.plus.net/" target="_blank"> Plusnet Community </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  It applies to our consumer, sole trader and partnership customers but doesn't apply to the information we hold about companies or organisations.
</p></p> <p><p>  It also applies even if you’re not one of our customers and you interact with us as part of us running our business, such as by:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>using one of our products or services - paid for by someone else,
</li><li>taking part in a survey or trial,
</li><li>entering a prize promotion,
</li><li>calling our helpdesk, or
</li><li>generally enquiring about our services or otherwise providing your personal information to us.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you need to give us personal information about someone else in relation to our products and services, the privacy policy will also apply. And if we need the permission of the other person to use that information, we’ll ask you to check they are OK with this.</p></p> <p><p>  Technology is a fast-changing area and can be complicated. We’ve included a glossary which explains the meaning of any technical terms we use.</p></p> <div><h3>  What's not included?</h3><p>  This policy doesn't apply to information about our employees or shareholders. It also doesn't cover other companies or organisations (which advertise our products and services and use <b> cookies </b>, <b> tags </b> and other technology) collecting and using your personal information to offer relevant online advertisements to you. Read our cookie policy about <a href="/help/legal/cookie-policy/" target="_blank"> how we use cookies on our website </a>.</p><p>  You can link to other organisations' websites, apps, products, services and social media from our websites. This privacy policy doesn't apply to how those other organisations use your personal information.</p></div> <p><p>  You should review their privacy policies before giving them your personal information.</p></p> <div><h3>  Who are we?</h3><p>  At <b> Plusnet </b>, we're part of a larger group of companies - the <b> BT Group </b>. Some other companies and parts of the <b> BT Group </b> have their own privacy policy. And they'll apply if you buy your product or service directly from them, but the EE and BT policies are broadly similar to this one.</p><p>  We review our privacy policy regularly. It was last updated on 21 October 2022. And we'll tell you if we change the policies, as set out here <a href="#how-to-contact-us-and-further-details" target="_blank"> How will we tell you about changes to the policy? </a></p></div> <div><h2>  Accessing and updating how we use your information

Once we've looked at your request, we'll let you know when you can expect to hear from us.</p><p>  We'll always try to help you with your request but we can refuse if we believe doing so would have a negative effect on others or the law prevents us. And even though we have to complete your request free of charge, we are allowed to reject requests if:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>they're repetitive;
</li><li>you don't have the right to ask for the information; or
</li><li>the requests made are excessive.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If that's the case, we'll explain why we believe we don't have to fulfil the request.</p></p> <div><h3>  Want to change your marketing preferences?</h3><p>  You can opt out of receiving marketing from us at any time using the link provided in the email or SMS message (text message) we have sent you or just by telling us when we call you.

This could be for legal or regulatory reasons, so that we can keep providing our products and services, or for another legitimate reason. For example, we keep certain billing information to show we have charged you correctly. But we'll always tell you why we keep the information.</p></p> <p><p>  We aim to provide our products and services in a way that protects information and respects your request. Because of this, when you delete or change (or ask us to delete or change) your information from our systems, we might not do so straight away from our back-up systems or copies on our active servers. And we may need to keep some information to fulfil your request (for example, keeping your email address to make sure it's not on our marketing list).</p></p> <p><p>  Where we can, we'll confirm any changes. For example, we'll check a change of address against the Postal Address File, or we might ask you to confirm it.</p></p> <p><p>  If we've asked for your permission to provide a service, you can withdraw that permission at any time. It'll take us up to 30 days to do that. And it only applies to how we use your personal information in the future, not what we've done in the past (for example, if we've run a credit check at the start of your contract).</p></p> <div><h3>  Moving to another provider and want to take your personal information?</h3><p>  If we provide you with our products and services, or you've said we can use your information, you can ask us to move, copy or transfer the information you have given us. You can ask us to do this using our <a href="https://btprivacy.my.onetrust.com/webform/a0327856-31fc-4f51-b6d3-1c9e883e1ecf/4e5e40b3-c897-4db3-bf1d-faddacb79714" target="_blank"> online form </a>.</p><p>  We'll send your personal information electronically.

But we can refuse if sharing the information would have a negative effect on others, for example because it includes personal information about someone else, or the law prevents us from doing so.</p></p> <div><p>  It will normally take us up to one month to get back to you but could take longer (up to a further two months) if it's a complicated request or you send us a lot of requests at once</p></div> <div><h2>  What information we collect and what we use it for
</h2><p>  The <b> personal </b> <b> information </b> we collect depends on the products and services you have and how you use them. We've explained the different ways we use your personal information below.</p></div> <div><h3>  To provide you with products and services</h3><p>  We'll use your personal information to provide you with products and services. This applies when you register for or buy a product or service from us. Or if you register for an online account with us or download and register on one of our apps.</p><p>  This means we'll:</p><ul>  <li>record details about the products and services you use or order from us;
</li><li>send you product or service-information messages (we'll send you messages to confirm your order and tell you about any changes that might affect your service, like when we have infrastructure work planned or need to fix something);
</li><li>update you on when we'll deliver, connect or install your products and services;
</li><li>let you create and log in to the online accounts we run;
</li><li>charge you and make sure your payment reaches us;
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>filter any <b> content </b> you ask us to, through your Parental Controls settings (or any <b> content </b> our partners ask us to, such as for a wi-fi hotspot);
</li><li>give information to someone else (if we need to for the product or service you've ordered) or to another communications provider if you're buying some services from them and us (if we do this, we still control your personal information and we have strict controls in place to make sure it's properly protected); and
</li><li>support you more if you are a vulnerable customer.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use the following to provide products and services and manage your account.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Your contact details and other information to confirm your identity and your communications with us. This includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth, email address, passwords and credentials (such as the security questions and answers we have on your account).
</li><li>Your payment and financial information.
</li><li>Your communications with us, including emails, webchats and phone calls. We'll also keep records of any settings or communication preferences you choose.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Details of the products and services you've bought within the BT Group, how they are performing and how you use them – including your <b> call </b>, <b> browser </b> (including IP address) and <b> TV records </b>.
</li><li>Information from cookies placed on your connected devices that we need so we can provide a service.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use this information to carry out our contract (or to prepare a contract) and provide products or services to you. If you don't give us the correct information or ask us to delete it, we might not be able to provide you with the product or service you ordered from us.</p></p> <p><p>  If you tell us you have a disability or otherwise need support, we'll note that you are a vulnerable customer, but only if you give your permission or if we have to for legal or regulatory reasons. For example, if you told us about a disability we need to be aware of when we deliver our services to you, we have to record that information so we don't repeatedly ask you about it. We will also record the details of a <b> Power of Attorney </b> we have been asked to log against your account.</p></p> <div><h3>  Because it is in our legitimate interests as a business to use your information</h3><p>  We'll use your personal information if we consider it is in our legitimate business interests so that we can operate as an efficient and effective business. We use your information to:</p><ul>  <li>Identify, and let you know about, products and services that interest you;
</li><li>share within the BT Group for administrative purposes and to tailor the offers we make to you;
</li><li>create aggregated and anonymised information for further use;
</li><li>detect and prevent fraud including sharing with other companies so they can protect you against fraud and maintain accurate records; and
</li><li>secure and protect our network.
</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  To market to you and to identify products and services that interest you</h3><p>  We'll use your personal information to send you direct marketing and to better identify products and services that interest you. We do that if you're one of our customers or if you've been in touch with us another way (such as entering a prize promotion or competition).</p><p>  This means we'll:</p><ul>  <li>create a profile about you to better understand you as a customer and tailor the communications we send you (including our marketing messages);
</li><li>tell you about other products and services you might be interested in;
</li><li>recommend better ways to manage what you spend with us, like suggesting a more suitable product based on what you use;
</li><li>try to identify products and services you're interested in; and
</li><li>show you more relevant online advertising (both on our and other parties' apps and sites) and work with other well-known brands to make theirs more suitable too.
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We use the following for marketing and to identify the products and services you're interested in, where applicable.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Your contact details. This includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth and email address.
</li><li>Your payment and financial information.
</li><li>Information from <b> cookies </b> and <b> tags </b> placed on your connected devices.
</li><li>Information from other organisations such as <b> aggregated </b> demographic data, data brokers (such as Response One), our partners and publicly available sources like the electoral roll and business directories.
</li><li>Details of the products and services you've bought within the BT Group and how you use them – including your <b> call </b>, <b> browser  </b>(including <b> IP address </b>) and <b> TV records. </b>
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We'll send you information (about the products and services we provide) by phone, post, email, <b> text message </b>, online banner advertising or a notice using our apps or on your TV set-top box. We also use the information we have about you to personalise these messages wherever we can as we believe it is important to make them relevant to you. We do this because we have a legitimate business interest in keeping you up to date with our products and services, making them relevant to you and making sure you manage your spending with us. We also check that you are happy for us to send you marketing messages by <b> text </b> or <b> email </b> before we do so. In each message we send, you also have the option to opt out.</p></p> <p><p>  We'll only use your <b> call, browser  </b>and some <b> TV records </b> (such as programmes you watch on channels we provide that are produced by other organisations) to personalise our offers as long as you are happy for us to do so.</p></p> <p><p>  We'll only market other organisations' products and services if you have said it is OK for us to do so.</p></p> <p><p>  You can ask us to stop sending you marketing information or withdraw your permission at any time, as set out above.</p></p> <p><p>  Read our cookie policy for more details on <a href="/help/legal/cookie-policy/" target="_blank"> how we use cookies </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  To create aggregated and anonymised data</h3><p>  We'll use your personal information to create <b> aggregated </b> and <b> anonymised </b> information. Nobody can identify you from that information and we'll use it to:</p><ul>  <li>make sure our network is working properly and continuously improve and develop our network and products and services for our customers;
</li><li>run management and corporate reporting, research and analytics, and to improve the business; and
</li><li>provide other organisations with <b> aggregated </b> and <b> anonymous </b> reports
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We use the following to generate <b> aggregated </b> and <b> anonymised </b> information.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Your gender, address and date of birth.
</li><li>Information about what you buy from us, how you ordered it and how you pay for it, for example, broadband ordered online and paid for on a monthly basis.
</li><li>Information from <b> cookies </b> and <b> tags </b> placed on your computer.
</li><li>Information from other organisations who provide aggregated demographic information, data brokers (such as Response One), our partners and publicly available sources like the electoral roll and business directories.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Details of the products and services you've bought and how you use them – including your <b> call </b>, <b> browser </b> (including <b> IP address </b>) and <b> TV records </b>.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We have a legitimate interest in generating insights that will help us operate our network and business or would be useful to other organisations.</p></p> <div><h3>  To develop our business and build a better understanding of what our customers want</h3><p>  This means we'll:</p><ul>  <li>maintain, develop and test our network (including managing the traffic on our network), products and services, to provide you with a better service;
</li><li>train our people and suppliers to provide you with products and services (but we make the information anonymous beforehand wherever possible);
</li><li>create a profile about you to better understand you as our customer;
</li><li>share personal information within the <b> BT Group </b> for administrative purposes, such as sharing contact details so we can get in touch with you, and details of what you buy from different companies within our Group; and
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>make and defend claims to protect our business interests; and
</li><li>run surveys and market research about our products.
</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  We use the following information to do this:</p><ul>  <li>Your contact details.
</li><li>Your payment and financial information.
</li><li>Your communications with us, including emails, webchats and phone calls (and any recordings made).
</li><li>Information from cookies placed on your connected devices.
</li><li>Details of the products and services you've bought and how you use them – including your <b> call </b>, <b> browser  </b>(including <b> IP address  </b>and <b> static IP address </b>, if it applies) and <b> TV records. </b>
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  If we use this information for market research, training, testing, development purposes, defend or bring claims or to create a profile about you, we do so because it is in our legitimate business interests of running an efficient and effective business which can adapt to meet our customers' needs.</p></p> <p><p>  We create a profile about you based on what you have ordered from us and how you use our products and services. This helps us tailor the offers we share with you. You can ask us to stop profiling you for marketing purposes at any time, as set out above.</p></p> <div><h3>  To run credit and fraud prevention checks</h3><p>  Before we provide you with a product or service (including upgrades or renewals), or sometimes when you use our products and services, we'll use personal information you have given us together with information we have collected from <b> credit reference agencies </b> (such as Experian or Equifax), the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) security alert, or <b> fraud prevention agencies </b> (such as Cifas). We use this information to manage our credit risk, and prevent and detect fraud and money laundering. We'll also use these organisations to confirm your identity. When they get a search from us, a 'footprint' goes on your file which other organisations might see. We might also share the information with other organisations. We do this because it's in our, and the organisations', legitimate interests to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to check identities, to protect our business and to keep to laws that apply to us.</p></div> <p><p>  Details of the personal information that will be used include your name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details and device identifiers, including <b> IP address </b> and vehicle details.</p></p> <p><p>  If you don't become one of our customers, we'll still keep the result of our credits checks about you if we have a legal obligation and it's in our legitimate interests to help prevent or detect fraud. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your information can be held by us and the organisations we share it with for up to six years.</p></p> <p><p>  If you give us false or inaccurate information which we identify as fraudulent, we'll pass that on to fraud prevention agencies. We might also share it with law enforcement agencies, as may the agencies we have shared the information with.</p></p> <p><p>  If you tell us you're associated with someone else financially (for example, by marriage or civil partnership), we'll link your records together. So you must make sure you have their agreement to share information about them. The agencies we share the information with also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully asks the agency to break that link.</p></p> <p><p>  If we, a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, decide that you are a credit, fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have asked for, or we may stop providing existing services to you.</p></p> <p><p>  The credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or money laundering risk and this may result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us using the details <a href="https://www.plus.net/help/legal/privacy-policy/#how-to-contact-us" target="_blank"> below </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  We send credit reference and fraud prevention agencies information about applications, and they keep that information. We might also give them details of your accounts and bills, including how you manage them. This includes telling them about your account balances, what you pay us and if you miss a payment (going back in the past, too). So if you don't pay your bills on time, credit reference agencies will record that. They, or a fraud prevention agency, might tell others doing similar checks – including organisations trying to trace you or recover money you owe them.</p></p> <p><p>  There are different credit reference agencies in the UK (for example, Callcredit, Equifax and Experian). Each one might hold different information about you. If you want to find out what information they have on you, they may charge you a small fee.</p></p> <p><p>  Whenever credit reference and fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area, they place contractual responsibilities on the organisation receiving it to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also make the organisation receiving the information subscribe to 'international frameworks' aimed at sharing information securely.</p></p> <p><p>  Here are links to the information notice for each of the three main Credit Reference Agencies.</p></p> <div><h3>  To collect debt</h3><p>  If you don't pay your bills, we might ask a debt-recovery agency to collect what you owe. We'll give them information about you (such as your contact details) and your account (the amount of the debt) and may choose to sell the debt to another organisation to allow us to receive the amount due.</p></div> <div><h3>  To prevent and detect crime and fraud</h3><p>  We'll use your personal information to help prevent and detect crime and fraud. We'll also use it to prevent and detect criminal attacks on our network or against your equipment. We monitor traffic over our network, trace nuisance or malicious calls, and track malware and cyber-attacks.</p><p>  To do that we use the following information, but only where strictly necessary.</p><ul>  <li>Your contact details and other information to confirm your identity and communications with us. This includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth, email address, passwords and credentials (for example, security questions). We do not store the original copy of your password. Instead we keep it in a form that allows us to authenticate you but does not allow us to work out what your original password is.
</li><li>Your payment and financial information.
</li><li>Information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Details of the products and services you've bought and how you use them – including your:
</li><li><b> Call records </b> – the date, time, length and cost of your communications, device information, the location of your device from <b> Cell Site </b> data (the antennae and communications equipment that we use to create the cellular network), where the call was made to and from, the network used and the type of communication, including when you make calls abroad.
</li><li><b> Browser records </b> – the types and nature of websites that you visit, as well as the date, time, length of your internet session, <b> cell site </b> and network used, device information, your data usage and your <b> IP address </b>.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><b> TV records </b> – details of the devices you use (including the <b> device information </b> – identifiers such as <b> MAC address </b> or <b> IMSI </b>), the channels, programmes and adverts you watch on them, the services you access, how long you watch and what actions you take when doing so, including how you view, record and fast-forward programmes

</li><li><b> Content </b> of <b> SMS </b> you send and receive using our network.
</li><li>CCTV footage in our shops and buildings.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use this personal information because we have a legitimate interest in protecting our network and business from attacks and to prevent and detect crime and fraud. We also share it with other organisations (such as other communications providers and banks) who have the same legitimate interests. Doing this helps make sure our network works properly and helps protect you from attacks.</p></p> <p><p>  If you call the emergency services, we'll give them information about you and where you are so they can help. We do this because it is necessary to protect you, or another person, and because it is in our interests to help the emergency services in providing help to you.</p></p> <p><p>  We may share your personal information with other companies who you have a relationship with – like your bank – or with those companies that process information on their behalf – so that they can ensure that their customer records are up to date, and also in some cases prevent fraud – for example by checking whether a transaction, such as an online payment or a cash withdrawal, is definitely being requested by you, and not a fraudster.</p></p> <div><h2>  To meet our legal and regulatory obligations
</h2><p>  We might have to release personal information about you to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</p></div> <div><h3>  To law enforcement agencies</h3><p>  Under investigatory powers legislation, we might have to share personal information about you to government and law-enforcement agencies, such as the police, to help detect and stop crime, prosecute offenders and protect national security. They might ask for the following details.</p><ul>  <li>Your contact details. This includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth, email address, passwords and credentials (such as your security questions and answers) needed to confirm your identity and your communications with us.
</li><li>Your communications with us, such as calls, emails and webchats.
</li><li>Your payment and financial information.
</li><li>Details of the products and services you've bought and how you use them – including your <b> call </b>, <b> browser </b> (including IP address) and <b> TV records </b>.
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  The balance between privacy and investigatory powers is challenging. We share your personal information when the law says we have to, but we have strong oversight of what we do and get expert advice to make sure we're doing the right thing to protect your right to privacy. You can read more about our approach to investigatory powers in our report on <a href="https://www.bt.com/about/digital-impact-and-sustainability/championing-human-rights/privacy-and-free-expression.html" target="_blank"> Privacy and free expression in UK communications </a></p></p> <span><span>   (opens new tab or window). And you can see the <a href="https://www.bt.com/about/bt/our-board/bt-compliance-committee" target="_blank"> terms of reference for our oversight body here </a></span></span> <span><span>   (opens new tab or window).</span></span> <p><p>  We'll also share personal information about you where we have to legally share it with another person. That might be when a law says we have to share that information or because of a court order.</p></p> <p><p>  In limited circumstances, we may also share your information with other public authorities, even if we do not have to. However, we would need to be satisfied that a disclosure of information is lawful and proportionate. And we would need appropriate assurances about security and how the information is used and how long it is kept.</p></p> <div><h3>  For regulatory reasons</h3><p>  We'll also use your <b> call </b>, <b> browser </b> (including <b> IP address </b>) and <b> TV records </b> to find the best way of routing your communications through the various parts of our network, equipment and systems as required by our regulator.</p><p>  If you order a phone service, we'll ask if you want your details included in our directory services such as the BT Phone Book. If you do, we'll publish your details and share that information with other providers of directory services. Ex-directory numbers aren't included and will not appear in The Phone Book. </p></div> <div><h2>  Sharing your information
</h2></div> <div><h3>  Who do we share your personal information with, why and how?</h3><p>  We share your personal information with other companies within the <b> BT Group </b>. We have a group-wide arrangement, known as <a href="https://img01.products.bt.co.uk/content/dam/bt/storefront/pdfs/UKBCRS20201215publicversion.pdf" target="_blank"> binding corporate rules (pdf 456KB) </a></p><span>   (opens new tab or window), to make sure your personal information is protected, no matter which company in the BT Group holds that information.</span></div> <p><p>  We also share your personal information with other companies – such as your bank - so they can protect you against fraud and maintain accurate records.</p></p> <p><p>  We also use other service providers to process personal information on our behalf.

</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Where we use another organisation, we still control your personal information. And we have strict controls in place to make sure it's properly protected. Finally, the section above describes the situations in which your personal information is shared to other organisations, government bodies and law-enforcement agencies. When we share your information with other organisations we'll make sure it's protected, as far as is reasonably possible.</p></p> <p><p>  If we need to transfer your personal information to another organisation for processing in countries that aren't listed as <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en#documents" target="_blank"> 'adequate' </a></p></p> <span><span>   (opens new tab or window) by the European Commission, we'll only do so if we have <b> model contracts </b> or other appropriate safeguards (protection) in place.</span></span> <p><p>  If there's a change (or expected change) in who owns us or any of our assets, we might share personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. If we do, they'll have to keep it confidential.</p></p> <p><p>  For more details, or if you'd like a copy of our binding corporate rules or other information about a specific transfer of your personal information, <a href="#how-to-contact-us-and-further-details" target="_blank"> get in touch with us here </a>.
