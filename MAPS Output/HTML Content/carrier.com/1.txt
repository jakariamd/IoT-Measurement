It is important that our users understand how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information (as defined below). Carrier has implemented technical, administrative and physical measures to safeguard any personal information that we may collect.</p></div> <p><p>  This Privacy Notice describes our practices related to Personal Information collected through the Websites and Apps, unless there is a separate privacy notice for a particular website or mobile application.</p></p> <p><p>  Carrier has a separate <a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice-general/" target="_blank"> General Privacy Notice </a> that covers Personal Information that Carrier may collect and process separate and apart from its Websites and Apps. If you apply for a job through this Website, Carrier’s use of the Personal Information you provide through the Careers section is governed by Carrier’s <a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice-job-applicant/" target="_blank"> Job Applicant Privacy Notice </a> found in that Careers section, and not this Privacy Notice. For individuals in the United States, Carrier has a <a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice-hipaa/" target="_blank"> HIPAA Privacy Notice </a>. See Carrier’s <a href="https://www.corporate.carrier.com/legal/privacy-notice/" target="_blank"> Cookies Policy </a> for information about cookies on our Websites and in our Apps.</p></p> <div><h2>  What Personal Information does Carrier collect? How does Carrier collect such Personal Information?</h2><p>  <strong> “Personal Information” </strong> is information through which a natural person is identifiable or may be identified. Carrier collects, uses and processes your Personal Information in order to provide you with services, products or information that you request.</p><p>  The collection of Personal Information will be transparent to you, and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to provide it. If you choose not to provide any of the Personal Information requested, Carrier may be unable to complete your transaction, or provide the information, services or products you have requested.</p></div> <p><p>  Carrier collects information, including Personal Information, from you when you submit a form or request, or register a product with Carrier, such as: name, physical address, the company for whom you work, phone number, email address and fax number, as well as any other Personal Information you provide to Carrier.

After this period, your Personal Information will be deleted from all systems of Carrier without notice.</p></div> <div><h2>  How can you correct, change or delete your information held by Carrier?</h2><p>  You may request to access, update, correct, change, or delete your Personal Information at any time.
