This Privacy Policy applies to Tubi’s collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information that identifies a specific person, such as full name or e-mail address). It also describes generally Company’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests, demographics, and services usage).</p></p> <p><p>  Tubi does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13, except with respect to certain types of Activity Information (described below) which is used only to support the internal operations of the Tubi Services. For more information, please see our Children’s Privacy Policy in <a href="#Children" target="_blank"> Section 6 </a> below. Accordingly, on some of the Tubi Services, children under 13 are not eligible to use certain features. The portions of the Tubi Services that are intended for children under 13 are governed by our Children’s Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION </strong> </p></p> <div><p>  Tubi and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:</p><p>  <strong> Registration Information </strong> is the information you submit to register for the Tubi Services, for example, to create an account, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest or sweepstakes. Registration Information may also include, for example, name, e-mail address, gender,and birthday.</p><p>  <strong> Information from Social Media </strong> If you access or log-in to the Tubi Services through a social media service or connect the Tubi Services to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, e-mail address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Tubi Services through social media services or when you connect the Tubi Services to social media services, you are authorizing Tubi to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Activity Information </strong> When you access and interact with the Tubi Services, Tubi and its service providers may collect certain information about those visits. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Tubi Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.

Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Tubi’s websites, apps and other services use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Tubi Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.</p></p> <p><p>  Other parties that support the Tubi Services by serving advertisements or providing services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Tubi Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Tubi Services (such as websites or e-mails) or other parties’ services. Those parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer.Tubi does not control these technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of parties using such technologies. For more information about third-party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, including your choices with respect to them, see the section entitled “To deliver relevant advertisements,” below.</p></p> <p><p>  Your browser may be initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, and to block cookies altogether.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY </strong> </p></p> <p><p>  The privacy of children is important to us. This Children’s Privacy Policy explains how Tubi collects, uses, and discloses personal information, as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong> COPPA </strong>”), of children under the age of 13 that is collected through the Tubi Services. This policy also explains the rights that parents have with respect to their children’s personal information.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> COLLECTION OF INFORMATION: </strong> Tubi and our service providers may collect the following information from and about children:</p><p>  <strong> Persistent Identifiers. </strong> When a child accesses and interacts with Tubi Services, we may collect persistent identifiers for our internal operations. For example, in order to permit a child’s connection to the Tubi Services, our servers receive and record certain information about their computer, device, and/or browser, including IP address or unique device identifier.</p></div> <p><p>  Cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels, beacons, and local storage technology, including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a unique identifier. Websites, apps, and other services send this data to a child’s browser or device when they first request a web page and then store the data on the child’s device so the website can access the information when the child makes subsequent requests for pages from that service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about a child’s usage of Tubi Services, such as pages visited, content viewed, search queries run and advertisements served.</p></p> <p><p>  Other parties that support Tubi Services by delivering contextual advertisements or providing services, such as compiling aggregate Tubi Service usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> USE AND DISCLOSURE: </strong> Tubi uses the information we collect to provide the Tubi Services and features, including: to measure and improve those Tubi Services and features; to improve the child’s experience with Tubi Services by delivering contextual advertising and limiting the number of times a child sees an advertisement on the Tubi Services; to provide the child with customer support and to respond to inquiries. When the information collected from or about a child does not identify them as a specific person, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties.</p></p> <div><p>  We use the information we collect from and about children for these additional purposes:</p><p>  <strong> To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the Tubi </strong> <strong> Services. </strong> Tubi may make a child’s information available to certain third-party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the Tubi Services.</p><p>  <strong> To deliver contextual advertisements. </strong> Tubi and our service providers may use the information we collect from and about a child to deliver contextual ads to them when they use the Tubi Services, and to limit the number of times a particular ad is shown.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> To protect the rights of Tubi and others. </strong> There may be instances when Tubi may disclose a child’s information, including situations where Tubi has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of Tubi, Tubi Affiliates or our or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the Tubi Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> To complete a merger or sale of assets. </strong> If Tubi sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, Tubi may transfer children’s information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> PARENTAL ACCESS AND CONTROL: </strong> If you would like to review the personal information that your child has provided to us, or if you would like to ask us to cease collecting personal information from your child, make no further use of the personal information we have collected from your child, make no further disclosure of your child’s personal information to third parties, or delete the personal information we have already collected from the child, you may contact us as outlined in Section 8. In your request, please include your name and your child’s name, e-mail address, and Tubi device ID (<a href="https://help.tubitv.com/hc/en-us/articles/5053307982747" target="_blank"> how to find it </a>), and specify clearly the action you would like us to take. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have questions, please contact us by the methods provided below in <a href="#Children" target="_blank"> Section 8 </a></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION </strong> </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Updates to Privacy Policy. </strong> Tubi may modify this Privacy Policy. Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the Tubi Services.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Location of Data. </strong> The Tubi Services are hosted in and managed from the United States.

The United States and other countries’ data protection laws may not be the same as those in your jurisdiction. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Linked Services. </strong> The Tubi Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes, or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies.

Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others. We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation or your request for deletion, for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security or recordkeeping policies. It may not always be possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints or contractual, financial or legal requirements.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 8. </strong> <strong> CONTACT US </strong> </p></p> <p><p>  If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us <a href="https://www.tubitv.com/static/support" target="_blank"> www.tubitv.com/static/support </a> and select “Terms of Use & Privacy Policy” from the list of available topics.
