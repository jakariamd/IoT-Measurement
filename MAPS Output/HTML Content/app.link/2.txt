Introduction</span><p>  These Terms & Conditions (“<strong> Terms </strong>”) are entered into by and between of Branch Metrics, Inc., a Delaware corporation d/b/a Branch Metrics ("<strong> Branch </strong>," "<strong> Branch Metrics </strong>," "<strong> we </strong>," or "<strong> us </strong>") and the entity or person accessing this website (“<strong> Website </strong>”) or placing an order for or accessing any Services made available by Branch Metrics (“<strong> Customer </strong>” or “<strong> you </strong>” or “<strong> your </strong>”). “<strong> Services </strong>" means the products and services that are made available online by Branch under these Terms, the “<strong> Beta Services </strong>”, as defined in these Terms, other services or products that Branch may make available from time to time, including associated Branch offline or mobile components. Services exclude (i) Web-based, mobile, offline or other software application functionality that interoperates with a Service, that is provided by Customer or a third party, and (ii) Third-Party Content, as defined in these Terms. By indicating your acceptance of these Terms or using any of our Services, you agree to be legally bound by, and use our Services in compliance with, all terms, conditions, and notices in the Agreement. By agreeing to these Terms, you warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on behalf of you and/or your company. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE OUR WEBSITE OR ANY SERVICES.  </p></div> <span><span>  2. Definitions</span></span> <p><p>  “<strong> Agreement </strong>” means these Terms together with any applicable Order Forms, and any exhibits, appendices, schedules, or attachments identified or referenced in these Terms, and any amendments attached hereto or hereafter attached by mutual written agreement of the parties (all of which are incorporated herein by reference).  </p></p> <p><p>  “<strong> Order Form </strong>” means an ordering document or online order specifying the Services to be provided hereunder that is entered into between Customer and Branch or any of their Affiliates, including any addenda and supplements thereto.

We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date given above. It is your responsibility to review these Terms frequently and to remain informed of any changes to them. The then-current version of these Terms will supersede all earlier versions. You agree that your continued use of our Services after such changes have been published to our Services will constitute your acceptance of such revised Terms. </span></div> <span><span>  3. SERVICE ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY</span></span> <p><p>  Branch will make the Services available to you pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and solely for Customer’s internal business needs. Branch shall: (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to make the online Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (i) planned downtime (of which Branch shall give advance electronic notice), (ii) emergency maintenance that is reasonably unforeseeable and necessary for purposes of maintaining the integrity or operation of the Services, regardless of the notice provided by Branch and (iii) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Branch’s reasonable control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem (other than one involving Branch employees), Internet service provider failure or delay, integrated third party applications , or denial of service attack, and (b) provide the Services in accordance with laws and government regulations applicable to Branch’s provision of its Services to its customers generally (i.e., without regard for Customer’s particular use of the Services), and subject to Customer’s use of the Services in accordance with the Agreement, the Documentation and the applicable Order Form. Your rights to access and use the Services are limited by all terms set forth in the Agreement.  </p></p> <span><span>  4. USE RESTRICTIONS; UPDATES & SUPPORT</span></span> <p><p>  4.1 Use Restrictions</p></p> <span><span>  . You must comply with all applicable laws when implementing, configuring, and using the Services. Except as expressly permitted under these Terms, you will not, and will not permit anyone else to: (a) make the functionality of the Services to any third party through any means, including, without limitation, any hosting, application services provider, service bureau, or other type of service; (b) use any automated tool (e.g., robots, spiders) to access or use the Services; (c) rent, lease, or sublicense your access to the Services to another person; (d) circumvent or disable any digital rights management, usage rules, or other security features of the Services or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services or its related systems or networks; (e) use the Services in a manner that overburdens, or that threatens the integrity, performance, or availability of, the Services; (f) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) on any portion of the Services; (g) send material containing software viruses, worms, trojan horses, or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents, or programs; (h) use Branch’s Services in violation of Branch’s Acceptable Use Policy available at </span></span> <span><span>  https://legal.branch.io/#branchio-aup</span></span> <span><span>  , or its successor URL; or (i) use the Services in connection with any Apps or websites that are directed to children under 13 (and in certain jurisdictions under the age of 16), without employing appropriate settings within the Branch SDKs to limit data collection from such children in accordance with applicable law. More information on these settings is available </span></span> <div><p>  here</p><span>  . If you have questions about how to use these settings or have any reason to believe that these resources may not address your particular use case, please reach out to the Branch Support team via the “Submit a Ticket” function at </span><span>  , or its successor URL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, use of the Services in violation of the foregoing restrictions by Customer that, in Branch’s judgment, threatens the integrity, performance, availability, or security of the Services may result in Branch’s immediate suspension of, or limitation in Customer’s access to, the Services.  </span></div> <p><p>  4.2 Updates and Support</p></p> <span><span>  . Branch will maintain, support, update, and provide error corrections for the Services to the same extent it does so for its customers generally. Ultimately, you are responsible for timely integration and launch of the Services. If Branch provides you with an update or maintenance release for the offline components of the Branch Services, unless you receive a separate license from Branch for that update or release that expressly supersedes these Terms, such update or release will be subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms. Branch shall have no liability for any damages that may result from Customer’s failure to implement upgrades or updates to the Services provided that Customer is notified in writing by Branch of an upgrade or update. All support requests must be sent to the Branch Support team via the “Submit a Ticket” function at </span></span> <span><span>  , or its successor URL. </span></span> <span><span>  5. BETA SERVICES</span></span> <p><p>  From time to time, Branch may invite You to try Beta Services. “<strong> Beta Services </strong>” means Our services or functionality that are not generally available to customers at no additional charge and that may be made available to You to try at Your option which are designated as beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation, or by a similar description. You may accept or decline any such trial in Your sole discretion. Beta Services are for evaluation purposes only and not for production use, are not subject to any service level agreements (SLAs) agreed to between you and Branch, and may be subject to additional terms. Branch is under no obligation to, maintain, support, update, or provide error corrections for the Beta Services. Branch may discontinue Beta Services at any time in Branch’s sole discretion and reserves the right to never make them generally available. BRANCH WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, CUSTOMER’S USE OF A BETA SERVICE. THE BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND AS AVAILABLE, AND ARE EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. <strong> WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WITH RESPECT TO THE BETA SERVICES, BRANCH EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, OR USAGE OF TRADE </strong>. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this section and any other provision of the Agreement, the terms of this section “BETA SERVICES” shall control and prevail with respect to Beta Services.  </p></p> <span><span>  6. PAID SERVICE TERMS</span></span> <p><p>  6.1 Fees</p></p> <span><span>  . You shall pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form or, if there is no Order Form executed by the Parties, you shall pay the fees set forth at the applicable rates available at </span></span> <span><span>  , or its successor URL (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Services, or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in an applicable Order Form, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed for the term of the Order Form.  </span></span> <p><p>  6.2 Payments & Invoicing</p></p> <span><span>  . To the extent you procure the Services with an applicable Order Form(s), invoices for the applicable Fees shall be sent to you via email to the email address(es) you designate in your account when signing up for Services, and you shall pay the Fees due upon receipt of such invoice. To the extent you procure the Services under an applicable Order Form, any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All Fees set forth in an applicable Order Form shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated therein. Fees are payable in United States dollars. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.  </span></span> <p><p>  6.3 Payment by Credit Card</p></p> <span><span>  . In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.  </span></span> <p><p>  6.4 Payment Disputes</p></p> <span><span>  . If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.  </span></span> <p><p>  6.5 Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration</p></p> <span><span>  . Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or canceling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.  </span></span> <p><p>  6.6 Taxes</p></p> <span><span>  .

You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”).

Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.</span></span> <div><span>  Taxes</span><span>  .

If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.</span></div> <div><span>  Withholding Taxes</span><span>  . In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("<b> Withholding Tax </b>"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.</span></div> <div><span>  Overdue Charges</span><span>  . If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.</span><span>  Term for Paid Services</span><span>  . Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.</span></div> <div><span>  Termination by Branch</span><span>  . Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. Upon termination of the Agreement, any outstanding balance through the effective date of termination and other unpaid payment obligations will be immediately due and payable in full.</span></div> <span><span>  Except with respect to paid services, as to which the terms and conditions governing termination are set forth above in the section "PAID SERVICE TERMS" of these Terms above, You acknowledge and agree that Branch, in its sole discretion, may terminate your use of the Services without prior notice for any reason at any time. You agree that Branch shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination by Branch.

Branch will maintain, support, update, and provide error corrections for the Services to the same extent it does so for its customers generally. Ultimately, you are responsible for timely integration and launch of the Services.

You may accept or decline any such trial in Your sole discretion. Beta Services are for evaluation purposes only and not for production use, are not subject to any service level agreements (SLAs) agreed to between you and Branch, and may be subject to additional terms. Branch is under no obligation to, maintain, support, update, or provide error corrections for the Beta Services. Branch may discontinue Beta Services at any time in Branch’s sole discretion and reserves the right to never make them generally available. BRANCH WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY HARM OR DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, CUSTOMER’S USE OF A BETA SERVICE. THE BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND AS AVAILABLE, AND ARE EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER. </span></span> <span><span>  . In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this section and any other provision of the Agreement, the terms of this section “BETA SERVICES” shall control and prevail with respect to Beta Services.</span></span> <div><span>  Fees</span><span>  . You will pay to Branch all fees specified in an Order Form (“Fees”). You are responsible for all undisputed Fees, even if such Fees are due and payable after termination of the Agreement or any portion thereof. Fees are non-cancellable and failure to use the Services does not constitute a basis for refusing to pay any Fees. Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, you will not receive any refund or prorated refund for amounts previously paid or amounts owed up to the effective date of termination.</span></div> <div><span>  Payments & Invoicing</span><span>  . Any relevant paid service-specific terms including, for example, contract duration, monthly fees, billing frequency, payment forms, and payment term will be addressed within an associated Order Form. All charges shall be invoiced in advance in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. You shall be responsible for the payment of any fees associated with an electronic funds transfer (i.e., ACH, wire transfer) when issuing payment to Branch, which includes fees from Your financial institution and intermediary banks. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Branch and notifying Branch of any changes to such information. In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay.</span></div> <div><span>  Payment by Credit Card</span><span>  . In certain instances where your payment method is via credit card, the issuer of the credit card may charge a transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. Fees will be billed to the credit card nominated by you and you authorize the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorize Branch (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until you or Branch cancels or terminates the Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, the transaction is returned after the payment has been settled, otherwise known as chargeback, or if there are insufficient funds in the case of check or debit card payments, you agree to pay all amounts plus any applicable transaction fees (e.g., NSF fees, chargeback fees) due upon demand.</span></div> <div><span>  Payment Disputes</span><span>  . If you have concerns about any charges on your invoice, you agree to the following dispute resolution process: (i) all billing disputes must be submitted in writing to billing@branch.io, (ii) billing disputes must be submitted within 90 days of the date the invoice was generated, and (iii) undisputed amounts will be subject to the Agreement and total payment for undisputed invoices or amounts must be submitted when due.</span><span>  Suspension or Cancellation of Service; Payment Acceleration</span></div> <span><span>  . Without derogating from any other remedies available to Branch under the Agreement or by applicable law, if you owe any undisputed Fees 30 days or more past due in connection with any Services provided by Branch under any applicable Order Form, then, without affecting any of your payment obligations under the Agreement (including, any payment obligations under an Order Form), Branch is entitled to take further action including but not limited to accelerating your unpaid fee obligations under such agreement so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspending and/or cancelling your access to the Services until such amounts are paid in full. Branch reserves the right to send your account to a collections agency for nonpayment (which may, in turn, report the uncollected debt to credit bureaus) and to use your contact information for debt collection purposes if the Agreement is terminated for non-payment as set forth herein following a 10-day cure period.</span></span> <div><span>  Taxes</span><span>  . Branch’s Fees do not include any local, state, or federal sales, use, excise, personal property, VAT, or other similar taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (including, without limitation, any withholding tax, and any such taxes, to the extent legally applicable, which shall be borne and paid by Customer) (collectively, "<b> Taxes </b>"). If Branch has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which you are responsible under this section, Branch will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless you provide Branch with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, you are responsible for payment of all Taxes resulting from any Fees payable hereunder, other than any taxes based on Branch’s net income, property, and employees.</span></div> <div><span>  Withholding Taxes</span><span>  . In the event Fees payable by you to Branch under the Agreement are subject to any applicable withholding tax, goods and services tax, or similar taxes required by any tax authority and you are required by applicable law to remit such withholding tax, you: (a) may withhold and deduct from any payments to Branch under the Agreement an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding tax to the extent required by applicable law ("<b> Withholding Tax </b>"), (b) will pay to the relevant taxation authority the amount of such applicable withholdings in accordance with applicable law; and (c) will pay to Branch the applicable amounts under this Agreement net of such Withholding Tax. You shall be discharged from the obligation to pay Withholding Tax amounts to Branch provided that (1) you have remitted such amount to the relevant taxation authority and (2) you furnish Branch with (i) your tax registration certificate(s) as proof of registration with the applicable taxation authority, and (ii) any and all relevant tax forms and/or statements with proof of Withholding Tax remittance amount to the taxation authority, the applicable rate, and other information which may reasonably be requested for the purpose of assisting Branch to seek any allowable credits or deductions for the Withholding Tax so withheld in each jurisdiction where you are subject to tax.</span></div> <div><span>  Overdue Charges</span><span>  . If any invoiced amount is not received by Branch by the due date set forth in the applicable invoice, then without limiting Branch’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 2.5% of the outstanding balance per month, and (b) Branch may condition future Order Form renewals on payment terms shorter than those specified in the applicable Order Form.</span><span>  Term for Paid Services</span><span>  . Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms set forth in these Terms shall be in force for as long as an Order Form referencing the Agreement is in effect. Except as otherwise agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, at the end of an applicable term, your access to the Services will automatically renew under the same Order Form terms (contract duration, billing frequency, payment period, etc.), unless and until your access to the Services is terminated in accordance with this section or either party to these Terms provides the other with notice of non-renewal (email sufficient; if to Branch, please email billing@branch.io) at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of any renewal period.</span></div> <div><span>  Termination by Branch</span><span>  . Except as expressly agreed to by you and Branch in a superseding Order Form, Branch reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any portion of the Services immediately upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice (email sufficient), provided that Branch will promptly provide a pro-rated refund of all pre-paid and unearned amounts based on the period of suspension or the date of discontinuance, as applicable. Branch may also, in its sole discretion, terminate your access to the Services or any portion thereof if you violate any terms of the Agreement, unless you cure such breach within thirty (30) days of the date Branch provides written notice to you of such violation. Termination by Branch for your violation of these Terms will be effective as of the last day of the 30-day cure period provided herein or immediately to the extent such violation reasonably cannot be cured. Upon termination of the Agreement, any outstanding balance through the effective date of termination and other unpaid payment obligations will be immediately due and payable in full.</span></div> <span><span>  Except with respect to paid services, as to which the terms and conditions governing termination are set forth above in the section "PAID SERVICE TERMS" of these Terms above, You acknowledge and agree that Branch, in its sole discretion, may terminate your use of the Services without prior notice for any reason at any time. You agree that Branch shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination by Branch.

Such termination will be effective as of the last day of the calendar month during which such termination notice is received.</span></span> <span><span>  Upon termination of the Agreement, those sections of these Terms that by their nature would reasonably be expected to survive will survive termination or expiration of these Terms, including but not limited to the sections on Termination, Privacy Policy & Data Rights, Confidential Information, Proprietary Rights, Limitation of Liability, and Legal Notices.</span></span> <div><span>  Privacy Policy</span><span>  .

Based on the definition of “sell” under the CCPA and under current regulatory guidance, we do not believe we engage in such activity and have not engaged in such activity in the past twelve months. Instead, we limit our sharing of information as set forth in the <a href="https://branch.io/policies/#privacy-how-does-branch-share-information" target="_blank"> “How does Branch Share Information?” </a> section of this Privacy Policy, and to allow third parties to collect certain information about your activity for limited purposes, for example through cookies, as explained in the <a href="https://branch.io/policies/#privacy-third-party-toolsanalytics-on-the-website" target="_blank"> “Third-Party Tools / Analytics on the Website” </a> section of our <a href="https://branch.io/policies/#privacy-third-party-toolsanalytics-on-the-website" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a></span></div> <div><span>  California Rights and Choices</span><span>  Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect about you and to delete that information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.  </span></div> <span><span>  <u> Right to request access to your personal information </u>California residents have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. However, we may withhold some personal information as permitted under applicable law. For example, to protect your security, we may withhold your account password from the information provided in response to a request for the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you.  </span></span> <span><span>  <u> Right to request deletion of your personal information </u>You may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from you. However, we may retain personal information necessary to (a) protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality, (c) necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.

We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf (e.g. through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney).  </span></span> <div><span>  <u> Submitting CCPA Requests </u> </span><span>  <b> For our Website: </b> If you are a California Consumer, please <a href="https://privacy.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> submit a CCPA request here </a>, or contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@branch.io" target="_blank"> privacy@branch.io </a>.

And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official </span><span>  Privacy Policybelow this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We limit the data we collect. </strong> We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Terms & Conditionsprohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. </strong> Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We do not rent or sell customer end user data. </strong> No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion <a href="https://branch.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> here  </a>of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.</span></span> <div><h3>  Introduction</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "<strong> Branch </strong>", "<strong> us </strong>", "<strong> our </strong>" or "<strong> we </strong>") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "<strong> Clients </strong>")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("<strong> Users </strong>") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.</span></div> <div><span>  This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</span><ul>  <li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:  </strong>This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "<strong> Branch Services </strong>" or the "<strong> Services </strong>").</li><li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: </strong> This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “<strong> Website </strong>”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:  </strong>This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Services</h2></div> <div><h3>  What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span></div> <div><h3>  The Branch Services: Overview</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.</span></div> <span><span>  Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.</span></span> <div><span>  The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:</span><ul>  <li>To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.</li><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li><li>To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.</li><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.</li><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).</span></span> <span><span>  In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.</span></span> <div><h3>  Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“<strong> Personal Data </strong>”).</span></div> <div><td>  Type of Information Collected</td><td>  Purpose</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; used for attribution and to understand general location</td><td>  Cookie</td><td>  Standard web cookies, used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Link Data</td><td>  Metadata controlled by the Client, which may be used to interpret the data for reporting, or for analytics</td><td>  User Agent</td><td>  Standard web browser user agent metadata; used for device identification and attribution</td></div> <div><td>  Referer</td><td>  Standard web browser HTTP referer; may be used for reporting and analytics</td><td>  Request</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request</td><td>  Engagement Data</td><td>  Information relating to the Client’s ad campaigns and User interactions, such as clicks on Client ads, Client ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, type of ads and the webpage from which such ads were displayed, and webpages on Client’s website visited by a User.</td></div> <span><span>  Other interactions, events and actions Clients choose to measure and analyze within their website (e.g., add to cart, purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).</span></span> <div><h3>  Information Collected by Branch SDKs</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  SDKs are Software Development Kits that include code that allows Clients to use the Branch Services. The Branch Mobile App SDKs, Web SDKs, and Over-the-Top (OTT) SDKs collect the following information when Clients use these SDKs in their applications or websites, some of which may be considered Personal Data under applicable law:</span><td>  <strong> Type of Information Collected </strong></td><td>  <strong> Purpose </strong></td></div> <td><td>  Advertising identifier (e.g., GAID, Android ID, IDFA, IDFV, RIDA)</td></td> <div><td>  Used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Branch Cookie ID</td><td>  Used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request;

to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.</li><li>to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.</li><li>to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.</span></span> <div><h3>  Our Clients’ Use of Information</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.</span></div> <div><span>  We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our </span><span>  Terms & Conditions. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.</span></div> <div><h3>  User Choices</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.</span><span>  <strong> Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out: </strong> Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking </span><span>  here. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.</span></div> <div><span>  <strong> NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out: </strong> Branch is a member of the </span><span>  Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct.

Branch will only be able to collect information from the device as permitted by these settings.</span></span> <div><span>  <strong> Client App Opt-out Controls: </strong> Branch‘s </span><span>  SDK Privacy Controlsallow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.</span><span>  <strong> Engagement Builder: </strong> Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.</span></div> <div><h2>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes</h2></div> <div><h3>  <strong> What Information Does Branch Collect about Website Visitors and Potential Customers? </strong></h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch collects information from Website visitors (“you” or “Website Users”) located at www.branch.io ( the “Website”), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io.

By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.</span></div> <div><h3>  Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official </span><span>  Privacy Policybelow this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We limit the data we collect. </strong> We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Terms & Conditionsprohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. </strong> Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We do not rent or sell customer end user data. </strong> No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion <a href="https://branch.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> here  </a>of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.</span></span> <div><h3>  Introduction</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "<strong> Branch </strong>", "<strong> us </strong>", "<strong> our </strong>" or "<strong> we </strong>") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "<strong> Clients </strong>")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("<strong> Users </strong>") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.</span></div> <div><span>  This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</span><ul>  <li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:  </strong>This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "<strong> Branch Services </strong>" or the "<strong> Services </strong>").</li><li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: </strong> This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “<strong> Website </strong>”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:  </strong>This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Services</h2></div> <div><h3>  What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span></div> <div><h3>  The Branch Services: Overview</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.</span></div> <span><span>  Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.</span></span> <div><span>  The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:</span><ul>  <li>To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.</li><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li><li>To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.</li><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.</li><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).</span></span> <span><span>  In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.</span></span> <div><h3>  Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“<strong> Personal Data </strong>”).</span></div> <div><td>  Type of Information Collected</td><td>  Purpose</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; used for attribution and to understand general location</td><td>  Cookie</td><td>  Standard web cookies, used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Link Data</td><td>  Metadata controlled by the Client, which may be used to interpret the data for reporting, or for analytics</td><td>  User Agent</td><td>  Standard web browser user agent metadata; used for device identification and attribution</td></div> <div><td>  Referer</td><td>  Standard web browser HTTP referer; may be used for reporting and analytics</td><td>  Request</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request</td><td>  Engagement Data</td><td>  Information relating to the Client’s ad campaigns and User interactions, such as clicks on Client ads, Client ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, type of ads and the webpage from which such ads were displayed, and webpages on Client’s website visited by a User.</td></div> <span><span>  Other interactions, events and actions Clients choose to measure and analyze within their website (e.g., add to cart, purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).</span></span> <div><h3>  Information Collected by Branch SDKs</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  SDKs are Software Development Kits that include code that allows Clients to use the Branch Services. The Branch Mobile App SDKs, Web SDKs, and Over-the-Top (OTT) SDKs collect the following information when Clients use these SDKs in their applications or websites, some of which may be considered Personal Data under applicable law:</span><td>  <strong> Type of Information Collected </strong></td><td>  <strong> Purpose </strong></td></div> <td><td>  Advertising identifier (e.g., GAID, Android ID, IDFA, IDFV, RIDA)</td></td> <div><td>  Used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Branch Cookie ID</td><td>  Used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request;

to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.</li><li>to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.</li><li>to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.</span></span> <div><h3>  Our Clients’ Use of Information</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.</span></div> <div><span>  We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our </span><span>  Terms & Conditions. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.</span></div> <div><h3>  User Choices</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.</span><span>  <strong> Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out: </strong> Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking </span><span>  here. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.

The types of information we may collect and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with us and the requirements of applicable law. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span></div> <div><h3>  What We Collect from Clients that Use the Website</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch collects Personal Data and non-personal data via the Website. For example, when Clients register to use our Services, we ask them to provide us with Personal Data, including first and last name and email address.</span><span>  <strong> Dashboard Information: </strong> Information we collect from visitors who register for an account on our dashboard includes the following, some of which is considered Personal Data under applicable law:</span></div> <div><td>  <strong> Type of Information Collected </strong></td><td>  <strong> Purpose </strong></td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; may be used for limited security login controls</td><td>  Cookie (ours)</td><td>  Standard web cookie used for dashboard session management</td><td>  Cookie (other-party)</td><td>  Other-party web tracking tools used for business intelligence</td><td>  First, Last Name</td><td>  Used for team user identification</td><td>  Work Email</td><td>  Used as the primary login identifier</td></div> <div><td>  Password</td><td>  Account registration, secure our Services and prevent fraud</td><td>  Account Holder Primary Role</td><td>  Account registration, tell Clients about products and services offered by Branch and Branch’s selected partners</td><td>  User Agent</td><td>  Standard web browser user agent metadata; may be used for limited security login controls</td><td>  Referer</td><td>  Standard web browser HTTP referer; may be used for general internal business analytics</td><td>  Request</td></div> <div><td>  Standard web HTTP request; may be used for general internal business analytics</td><td>  Github ID</td><td>  (optional) Can be used as a login method</td><td>  Billing information</td><td>  Payment account registration</td><td>  Log Data</td><td>  Provide the Services, tell Clients about products and services offered by Branch and Branch’s selected partners, personalize our experience, secure our Services and prevent fraud, and defend our legal rights and comply with the law</td><td>  Account holder feedback</td></div> <div><td>  Help us improve your experience on the account dashboard</td><span>  When a Client creates an account and uses the Services, Branch may collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Client is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g., browser type and version, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Client (“Log Data”).</span><span>  We also require Clients to set up a user ID and unique password for account security purposes. Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.</span></div> <span><span>  <strong> Account and Billing Information: </strong> To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect limited billing, payment, and contract information from Clients through our payment and contract vendors.</span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Connection Information with Other Parties:  </strong>Some features of the dashboard Services allow you to disclose your information through your accounts to other companies such as Facebook and Google. If you choose to connect Branch to such services provided by other parties, we may collect information related to your use of those services provided by other parties, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your accounts with those other parties. We will ask you for permission before you authorize our collection of this information. We may also collect information about how you are using the Services to interact with those connected services.</span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Information from Other Sources: </strong> In addition to the information collected through our Website, we or our vendors may obtain and disclose additional information, such as job title or contact information, from other public and non-public sources such as business websites, social networking platforms, or databases maintained by other parties.

We may engage vendors to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities.</span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Cookies, Pixels and Web Beacons: </strong> We also collect other data via the Website from Website Users, including Website Users employed by or affiliated with Clients, through cookies and/or web beacons.

In those cases, and where you have consented to Branch's processing of your Personal Data in connection with your use of the Website, you may withdraw that consent at any time by following the instructions below. Additionally, before we use Personal Data collected with your consent for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and ask for your consent for the new purpose. Where your consent for the processing of Personal Data is otherwise required by law or contract, we will comply with the law or contract.

Please note that "Do Not Track" is a different privacy mechanism than the Global Privacy Control browser choice referenced below.</span></span> <span><span>  Note that, even if you opt out, we may still collect and use non-personal data regarding your activities on our Website. This also does not opt you out of being served advertising altogether; you will continue to receive generic advertisements.</span></span> <div><h3>  Vendor Tools/Analytics on the Website</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  The Website utilizes tracking tools from vendors, which may enable these vendors to analyze our Website traffic for analytics purposes.

In the process of providing the Services, we may transfer information across borders from other countries or jurisdictions into the United States. Data protection laws in the United States may differ from your country, and the data Branch processes may be accessible to law enforcement and national security authorities under certain circumstances. By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.</span></div> <div><h3>  Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.</span></span> <span><span>  In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. We further describe our privacy practices in the official </span><span>  Privacy Policybelow this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We limit the data we collect. </strong> We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect to provide our services is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs to provide our services. Nor do we want to. In fact, our </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Terms & Conditionsprohibit our customers from providing Branch with any kind of sensitive end-user information.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. </strong> Customers who subscribe to our linking and analytics platform can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We do not rent or sell customer end user data. </strong> No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  hereof that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with the CCPA and GDPR requirements.</span></span> <span><span>  Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.</span></span> <div><h3>  Introduction</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch Metrics, Inc. ( "<strong> Branch </strong>", "<strong> us </strong>", "<strong> our </strong>" or "<strong> we </strong>") offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "<strong> Clients </strong>")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("<strong> Users </strong>") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications.

We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span></div> <div><h3>  The Branch Services: Overview</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.</span></div> <span><span>  Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.</span></span> <div><span>  The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:</span><ul>  <li>To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.</li><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li><li>To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.</li><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.</li><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).</span></span> <span><span>  In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.</span></span> <div><h3>  Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“<strong> Personal Data </strong>”).</span></div> <div><td>  Type of Information Collected</td><td>  Purpose</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; used for attribution and to understand general location</td><td>  Cookie</td><td>  Standard web cookies, used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Link Data</td><td>  Metadata controlled by the Client, which may be used to interpret the data for reporting, or for analytics</td><td>  User Agent</td><td>  Standard web browser user agent metadata; used for device identification and attribution</td></div> <div><td>  Referer</td><td>  Standard web browser HTTP referer; may be used for reporting and analytics</td><td>  Request</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request</td><td>  Engagement Data</td><td>  Information relating to the Client’s ad campaigns and User interactions, such as clicks on Client ads, Client ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, type of ads and the webpage from which such ads were displayed, and webpages on Client’s website visited by a User.</td></div> <span><span>  Other interactions, events and actions Clients choose to measure and analyze within their website (e.g., add to cart, purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).</span></span> <div><h3>  Information Collected by Branch SDKs</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  SDKs are Software Development Kits that include code that allows Clients to use the Branch Services. The Branch Mobile App SDKs, Web SDKs, and Over-the-Top (OTT) SDKs collect the following information when Clients use these SDKs in their applications or websites, some of which may be considered Personal Data under applicable law:</span><td>  <strong> Type of Information Collected </strong></td><td>  <strong> Purpose </strong></td></div> <td><td>  Advertising identifier (e.g., GAID, Android ID, IDFA, IDFV, RIDA)</td></td> <div><td>  Used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Branch Cookie ID</td><td>  Used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request;

to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.</li><li>to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.</li><li>to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.</span></span> <div><h3>  Our Clients’ Use of Information</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.</span></div> <div><span>  We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our </span><span>  Terms & Conditions. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.</span></div> <div><h3>  User Choices</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.</span><span>  <strong> Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out: </strong> Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking </span><span>  here. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.</span></div> <div><span>  <strong> NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out: </strong> Branch is a member of the </span><span>  Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct.

Branch will only be able to collect information from the device as permitted by these settings.</span></span> <div><span>  <strong> Client App Opt-out Controls: </strong> Branch‘s </span><span>  SDK Privacy Controlsallow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.</span><span>  <strong> Engagement Builder: </strong> Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.</span></div> <div><h2>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes</h2></div> <div><h3>  <strong> What Information Does Branch Collect about Website Visitors and Potential Customers? </strong></h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch collects information from Website visitors (“you” or “Website Users”) located at www.branch.io ( the “Website”), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io.

Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account.

Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.</span></div> <div><h3>  Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States</h3><span>  Top</span><span>  Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

(<strong> "Branch" </strong>, <strong> "us" </strong>, <strong> "our" </strong> or <strong> "we" </strong>) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "<strong> Clients </strong>")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("<strong> Users </strong>") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.  </p></div> <div><p>  This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:  </p><ul>  <li>Collection and Use of Information from Our Services:</li></ul><span>   This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our linking and analytics products and services (the "<strong> Branch Services </strong>" or the "<strong> Services </strong>").</span><ul>  <li>Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes:</li></ul><span>   This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “<strong> Website </strong>”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from vendors and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li>Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website:</li></ul><span>   This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.</span><p>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Services</p><p>  What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?</p><p>  <strong> Top </strong></p><p>  Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.  </p></div> <div><p>  The Branch Services: Overview</p><p>  Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.  </p></div> <p><p>  Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.  </p></p> <div><p>  The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:  </p><ul>  <li>To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.</li><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li><li>To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.</li><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the Client’s tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.</li><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Branch requires that each Client commit to disclose to Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to disclose to Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from disclosing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).  </p></p> <p><p>  In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.  </p></p> <div><p>  Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels</p><p>  Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client.

to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch discloses to Clients, and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.</li><li>to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or other parties.</li><li>to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and disclose these reports to the public.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also disclose such data to any other parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.</p></p> <div><p>  Our Clients’ Use of Information</p><p>  <strong> Top </strong></p><p>  Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to disclose information about a hotel that she found in a travel app to a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being disclosed from its app.  </p></div> <div><p>  We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our </p><p>  Terms & Conditions</p><span>  . Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.  </span><p>  User Choices</p><p>  <strong> Top </strong></p></div> <p><p>  Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms.

The types of information we may collect and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with us and the requirements of applicable law.

We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.  </p></p> <div><p>  What We Collect from Clients that Use the Website</p><p>  Branch collects Personal Data and non-personal data via the Website.

Clients must not disclose their passwords to anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.  </p></p> <div><p>  Account and Billing Information:</p><span>   To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect limited billing, payment, and contract information from Clients through our payment and contract vendors.  </span><p>  Connection Information with Other Parties:</p><span>   Some features of the dashboard Services allow you to disclose your information through your accounts to other companies such as Facebook and Google.

We use this information to better enable Branch to identify and contact businesses that might be interested in engaging our Services, and to gain a better understanding of a potential Client’s business needs.  </span></div> <div><p>  Communications with Branch:</p><span>   Some Website Users may provide Personal Data to Branch by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website. We use this information to answer their question(s), and may store that information for our record keeping, marketing, and advertising purposes.  </span><p>  Research/Survey Solicitations:</p><span>   From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage vendors to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities.  </span></div> <p><p>  Cookies, Pixels and Web Beacons:</p></p> <span><span>   We also collect other data via the Website from Website Users, including Website Users employed by or affiliated with Clients, through cookies and/or web beacons.

By using the Services, each Client and Website User consents to the transfer and processing of information to the U.S. in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.  </p></div> <p><p>  Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Top </strong></p><p>  Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. You’ll find our official </span><span>  Privacy Policy</span><span>  below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We limit the data we collect. </strong> We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs. Nor do we want to. In fact, our </li></ul></ul> <div><span>  Terms & Conditions</span><span>   prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.</span><ul>  <li><strong> We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. </strong> Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We do not rent or sell personal data. </strong> No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion </li></ul></ul> <div><span>  here </span><span>  of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.</span><span>  Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.</span></div> <div><h2>  <strong> Introduction </strong></h2></div> <div><h4>  <strong> Top </strong></h4><span>  Branch Metrics, Inc. (<strong> "Branch" </strong>, <strong> "us" </strong>, <strong> "our" </strong> or <strong> "we" </strong>) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "<strong> Clients </strong>")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("<strong> Users </strong></span><span>  ") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.</span></div> <div><span>  This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</span><ul>  <li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: </strong> This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our products and services (the "<strong> Branch Services </strong>" or the "<strong> Services </strong>").</li><li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: </strong> This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: </strong> This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Services</h2></div> <div><h3>  <strong> What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services? </strong></h3></div> <div><h4>  <strong> Top </strong></h4><span>  Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span></div> <div><h4>  <strong> The Branch Services: Overview </strong></h4></div> <div><h4>  <strong> Top </strong></h4><span>  Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity. </span></div> <span><span>  Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.  </span></span> <div><span>  The key use cases of Branch’s Services are: </span><ul>  <li>To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.</li><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li><li>To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.</li><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client. </li><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).  </span></span> <span><span>  In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.</span></span> <div><h4>  <strong> Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels </strong></h4></div> <div><h4>  <strong> Top </strong></h4><span>  Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“<strong> Personal Data </strong>”).</span><td>  Type of Information Collected</td></div> <div><td>  Purpose</td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; used for attribution and to understand general location</td><td>  Cookie</td><td>  Standard web cookies, used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Link Data</td><td>  Metadata controlled by the Client, which may be used to interpret the data for reporting, or for analytics</td><td>  User Agent</td><td>  Standard web browser user agent metadata; used for device identification and attribution</td><td>  Referer</td></div> <div><td>  Standard web browser HTTP referer; may be used for reporting and analytics</td><td>  Request</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request</td><td>  Phone Number</td><td>  (Optional) used only to facilitate the “Text me the app” feature if used</td><td>  Engagement Data</td><td>  Information relating to the Client’s ad campaigns and User interactions, such as clicks on Client ads, Client ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, type of ads and the webpage from which such ads were displayed, and webpages on Client’s website visited by a User. </td></div> <span><span>  Other interactions, events and actions Clients choose to measure and analyze within their website (e.g., add to cart, purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).</span></span> <div><h4>  SDKs are Software Development Kits that include code that allows Clients to use the Branch Services.

</strong></h3><span>  <strong> Top </strong></span><span>  Data Branch collects through the Services is processed: </span><ul>  <li>to better understand how and from where Users come to download certain apps, what types of apps are popular, or to infer that certain browsers and devices are operated by the same User based upon connections Branch has derived across non-affiliated apps and websites.</li><li>to provide, maintain, optimize, research and improve the Branch Services we provide our Clients, including to support other Branch products and services, develop new products and services, and market products or services; to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.</li><li>to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.</li><li>to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and share these reports with the public.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.</span></span> <div><h3>  <strong> Our Clients’ Use of Information </strong></h3><span>  <strong> Top </strong></span><span>  Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app. </span></div> <div><span>  We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our </span><span>  . Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.</span></div> <div><h3>  <strong> User Choices </strong></h3><span>  <strong> Top </strong></span><span>  Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below. </span><span>  <strong> Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out: </strong> Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking </span><span>  here</span><span>  . This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.  </span></div> <div><span>  <strong> NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out: </strong> Branch is a member of the </span><span>  Network Advertising Initiative</span><span>   (“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct. NAI provides you with the opportunity to opt out (on a browser-by-browser basis) from interest-based advertising by participating NAI members, including Branch. That opt-out is available <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank"> here </a>.  </span><span>  <strong> Device-Based Opt-Out:  </strong>You can submit a request to opt out of the Branch Services on a particular device by submitting a request </span></div> <div><span>  here</span><span>  Device Identifiers:</span><span>   To use your device’s privacy settings controls, please visit the privacy settings menu of your device to review and access the privacy controls made available on the device. Branch will only be able to collect information from the device as permitted by these settings.  </span><span>  <strong> Client App Opt-out Controls: </strong> Branch‘s </span><span>  SDK Privacy Controls </span><span>  allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User’s data should not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.  </span></div> <div><span>  <strong> Engagement Builder: </strong></span><span>   Branch's Engagement Builder feature may be used to help Clients conduct re-engagement and re-targeting campaigns. We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.</span></div> <div><h2>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes</h2></div> <div><h3>  <strong> What Information Does Branch Collect about Website Visitors and Potential Customers? </strong></h3></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Top </strong></h3></div> <div><h3>  Branch collects information from Website visitors (<strong> “you” </strong> or <strong> “Website Users” </strong>) located at www.branch.io (<strong> the “Website” </strong></h3><span>  ), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io.

Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

And we are proud of our commitment to providing our services in a privacy-first way. So we thought it would be helpful to lay out, in plain English, the Branch Guiding Privacy Principles that drive how we’ve chosen to design our services with privacy as a top priority. You’ll find our official <a href="https://branch.io/policies/privacy-policy/#privacy-introduction" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a></span></div> <span><span>   below this section, but we hope you’ll find this summary of our principles helpful.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We limit the data we collect. </strong> We practice data minimization, which means that we take steps to avoid collecting or storing information that we don’t need to provide our services. The personal data that we collect is limited to data like advertising identifiers, IP address, and information derived from resettable cookies (the full list is below in our privacy policy). We do not collect or store information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or SSNs. Nor do we want to. In fact, our <a href="https://branch.io/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank"> Terms & Conditions </a> prohibit our customers from sharing with Branch any kind of sensitive end-user information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We will only provide you with data about actual end-user activity on your apps or websites. </strong> Our customers can only access “earned” cookies or identifiers. This means that an end user must visit a customer’s site before our customer can see the cookie; and an end user must download a customer’s app in order for Branch to collect the end user’s advertising identifier for that customer. In short, the Branch services benefit customers who already have seen an end user across their platforms and want to understand the relationship between those web visits and app sessions.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> We do not rent or sell personal data. </strong> No Branch customer can access another Branch customer’s end-user data. And we are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else. To enable customers to control their end-user personal data, they can request deletion <a href="https://privacy.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> here </a> of that data at any time, whether in bulk or for a specific end user. These controls are available to customers worldwide, although we designed them to comply with GDPR requirements as well.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Beyond these principles stated above, Branch will continue to find ways to design our services to respect end user privacy. We’re committed to making sure our customers understand how we use data they entrust to us and how they can control it so that they can, in turn, be transparent with their end users.</span></span> <div><span>  Introduction</span><span>  Branch Metrics, Inc. (<strong> "Branch" </strong>, <strong> "us" </strong>, <strong> "our" </strong> or <strong> "we" </strong>) offers a linking and analytics platform enabling developers of applications (our "<strong> Clients </strong>")--whether those applications are websites or "apps," and across different types of devices--to improve their end users’ ("<strong> Users </strong></span><span>  ") cross-application experiences, and to derive additional insights into how their Users download and utilize those applications. Branch recognizes and believes that data privacy is important to all Internet users, and therefore we design and operate our services in a privacy-first manner.</span></div> <div><span>  This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</span><ul>  <li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Services: </strong> This section explains how Branch collects and uses information about Users in connection with our products and services (the "<strong> Branch Services </strong>" or the "<strong> Services </strong>").</li><li><strong> Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes: </strong> This section explains how we collect and use information about our website visitors through our website located at branch.io (the “Website”), which includes the dashboard we provide to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. So, if you are a Client using our Branch dashboard, this section applies to the data we collect from you. It also explains how we collect information about potential Clients from service providers and other sources to enhance our marketing efforts.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Policies Applicable to Both Our Services & Our Website: </strong> This section lays out the parts of the Branch Privacy Policy that apply to both the Services and to the Website.</li></ul></ul> <div><span>  What Information Does Branch Collect from Our Services?</span><span>  Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span><span>  The Branch Services: Overview</span><span>  Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients understand the use of their digital properties by their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the Client. The Client can use this information to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.  </span></div> <span><span>  Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture User action on behalf of the Client. Using the information collected from these Branch Mechanisms, Branch uses a variety of attribution techniques to connect User actions across different channels and platforms. Some of these attribution techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, creating and storing identifiers unique to the Branch platform to connect User actions and identifiers together, and predictive modeling algorithms using real-time and historical data parameters observed from User interactions where there are no shared identifiers available, as well as using historical connections Branch has derived over time using our technology. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.  </span></span> <div><span>  The key use cases of Branch’s Services are:</span><ul>  <li>To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.</li><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li><li>To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.</li><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising or other identifiers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.</li><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users), and that it has the right to share with Branch. We strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services, and we prohibit them from providing us with data relating to children under 13 (or, in certain jurisdictions, under 16).  </span></span> <span><span>  In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.</span></span> <div><span>  Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels</span><span>  Branch collects the following information from URLs created by the Client (i.e., Branch Links) and pixels placed on Client websites. Branch Links may be embedded into QR Codes as configured by the Client.

to support the products and services of our Clients; and as permitted or required by applicable law.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to fulfill Clients’ and prospective Clients’ requests for the Services including processing data at the Client’s direction and transferring User data to them. Branch does not control how Clients use information Branch shares with Clients and Users should read Clients’ Privacy Policies to understand how they use information they receive from Branch.</li><li>to aggregate data across various sources, including data from various Clients or third parties.</li><li>to create reports based on aggregated information, which is information that cannot reasonably be linked back to any individual person or Client and share these reports with the public.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for anti-fraud protection and analysis relating to the Services to ensure more accurate attribution measurement, general fraud prevention, or where otherwise required by law.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We may aggregate and/or de-identify the data we collect through the Services. After data has been aggregated and/or de-identified, Branch cannot use it to personally identify an individual. We may use de-identified and/or aggregated data for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including business partners, Clients, and/or others.</span></span> <div><span>  Our Clients’ Use of Information</span><span>  Our Clients may use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.  </span></div> <span><span>  We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our <a href="https://branch.io/policies/" target="_blank"> Terms & Conditions </a></span></span> <span><span>  . Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.</span></span> <div><span>  User Choices</span><span>  Branch recognizes a number of consumer choice mechanisms. Due to the nature of the Services, some functionality may be degraded or no longer work as a result if you exercise certain of the opt-outs below.  </span><span>  <strong> Branch’s Browser Cookie Opt-Out: </strong> Our cookie-based opt-out can be accessed by clicking <a href="https://app.link/optout" target="_blank"> here </a>. This will place a Branch opt-out cookie on your browser. Where Branch detects the presence of that opt-out cookie, we will no longer read or set cookies (beyond the opt-out cookie itself). Cookie-based opt outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt out will not be effective on your mobile device.  </span></div> <span><span>  <strong> NAI Browser-Based Opt-Out: </strong> Branch is a member of the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative </a> (“NAI”) and adheres to its Code of Conduct.

We require that Clients using Branch’s Engagement Builder feature for such purposes respect User opt-out preferences passed to them by Branch.</span></span> <div><span>  Collection and Use of Information from Our Website and for Marketing Purposes</span><span>  What Information Does Branch Collect about Website Visitors and Potential Customers?</span><span>  Branch collects information from Website visitors (<strong> “you” </strong> or <strong> “Website Users” </strong>) located at www.branch.io (<strong> the “Website” </strong></span><span>  ), which includes the dashboard provided to our Clients located at dashboard.branch.io. The types of information we may collect and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with us and the requirements of applicable law. Below are the legal bases and some of the ways we collect information and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.</span></div> <div><span>  What We Collect from Clients that Use the Website</span><span>  Branch collects Personal Data and non-personal data via the Website. For example, when Clients register to use our Services, we ask them to provide us with Personal Data, including first and last name and email address.  </span><span>   Information we collect from visitors who register for an account on our dashboard includes the following, some of which is considered Personal Data under applicable law:</span><td>  <b> Type of Information Collected </b></td></div> <div><td>  <b> Purpose </b></td><td>  IP Address</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; may be used for limited security login controls</td><td>  Cookie (ours)</td><td>  Standard web cookie used for dashboard session management</td><td>  Cookie (third-party)</td><td>  Third-party web tracking tools used for business intelligence</td><td>  First, Last Name</td><td>  Used for team user identification</td><td>  Work Email</td><td>  Used as the primary login identifier</td><td>  Password</td><td>  Account registration, secure our Services and prevent fraud</td></div> <div><td>  Account Holder Primary Role</td><td>  Account registration, tell Clients about products and services offered by Branch and Branch’s selected partners</td><td>  User Agent</td><td>  Standard web browser user agent metadata; may be used for limited security login controls</td><td>  Referer</td><td>  Standard web browser HTTP referer; may be used for general internal business analytics</td><td>  Request</td><td>  Standard web HTTP request; may be used for general internal business analytics</td></div> <div><td>  Github ID</td><td>  (optional) Can be used as a login method</td><td>  Billing information</td><td>  Payment account registration</td><td>  Log Data</td><td>  Provide the Services, tell Clients about products and services offered by Branch and Branch’s selected partners, personalize our experience, secure our Services and prevent fraud, and defend our legal rights and comply with the law</td><td>  Account holder feedback</td><td>  Help us improve your experience on the account dashboard</td></div> <span><span>  We also require Clients to set up a user ID and unique password for account security purposes. Clients must not share their passwords with anyone. Clients also have the option of adding other team members to their account. This account information enables us to set up an account for Clients, to provide the Services, and to otherwise manage Client accounts. We may also use this information to notify Clients about updates to our Services and provide them with promotional emails. We offer a mechanism to opt out from promotional emails as described in the “Opt-Out from Promotional Emails” section below.</span></span> <span><span>  When a Client creates an account and uses the Services, Branch may collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a Client is connecting to the Services, information related to the device being used to connect to the Services (e.g., browser type and version, device type, OS version) and the features and functions of the Services used by the Client (“Log Data”).  </span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Account and Billing Information: </strong> To the extent that we charge a fee for the Services, we may also collect limited billing, payment, and contract information from Clients through our third-party payment and contract processors.  </span></span> <span><span>   Some features of the dashboard Services allow you to share your information through your accounts with other companies such as Facebook and Google. If you choose to connect Branch to such third-party services, we may collect information related to your use of those third-party services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your third-party service accounts. We will ask you for permission before you authorize our collection of this information. We may also collect information about how you are using the Services to interact with those connected third-party services.  </span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Information from Other Sources: </strong> In addition to the information collected through our Website, we or our third-party service providers may obtain additional information, such as job title or contact information, from other public and non-public sources such as business websites, social networking platforms, or third-party databases. We use this information to better enable Branch to identify and contact businesses that might be interested in engaging our Services, and to gain a better understanding of a potential Client’s business needs.  </span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Communications with Branch: </strong> Some Website Users may provide Personal Data to Branch by sending us an email or filling out an online form on the Website. We use this information to answer their question(s), and may store that information for our record keeping, marketing, and advertising purposes.  </span></span> <span><span>   From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities.</span></span> <span><span>  Cookies, Pixels and Web Beacons:</span></span> <span><span>   We also collect other data via the Website from Website Users, including Website Users employed by or affiliated with Clients, through cookies and/or web beacons.

Data transfers from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland are transferred on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield mechanism discussed in the “Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States” section below.</span></div> <span><span>  Privacy Shield For EU, UK, and Swiss Personal Data Transferred into the United States</span></span> <span><span>  Branch complies with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member countries (including European Economic Area member countries), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. Branch recognizes that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export personal data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area, and that the Swiss Data Protection Authority similarly held the Swiss-US Privacy Shield inadequate. Branch will continue to honor its obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data that was transferred pursuant to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank"> https://www.privacyshield.gov </a></span></span> <span><span>  Branch no longer relies on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to transfer data that originated in the EEA or the United Kingdom to the U.S.  </span></span> <span><span>  Branch is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the US Federal Trade Commission.  </span></span> <span><span>  Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks we are obliged to inform EU, UK, and Swiss individuals whose data is being transferred into the United States that we may be required to release Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.  </span></span> <span><span>  Branch remains liable for the onward transfer of EU, UK, and Swiss personal data to agent third parties pursuant to the Privacy Shield unless we can prove we were not a party to the actions giving rise to the damages.  </span></span> <span><span>  We acknowledge the right of EU, UK, and Swiss individuals to access their Personal Data pursuant to the Privacy Shield. EU, UK, and Swiss individuals wishing to exercise this right may do so by contacting privacy@branch.io.  </span></span> <span><span>  In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Branch commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

All Suppliers shall promote a safe, diverse, lawful and respectful work environment. We believe that this Supplier Code will reinforce those qualities and attributes that have made both Branch and you successful. </span></div> <span><span>  Suppliers are expected to review, understand and comply with the policies set forth in this Supplier Code. The Supplier Code should be viewed as the minimum standards that we expect and is not intended in any way to lessen your contractual obligations with Branch. Failure to comply with this Supplier Code may result in Branch’s review of its engagement with a Supplier and may result in termination of Supplier’s relationship with Branch.</span></span> <span><span>  This Supplier Code and all policies contained herein will be administered in accordance with applicable law and may be updated from time to time. If you have questions about this Supplier Code, you can contact Branch at <a href="http://legal@branch.io/" target="_blank"> legal@branch.io </a>. </span></span> <span><span>  <strong> Compliance with Rules, Laws, and Regulations </strong></span></span> <span><span>  Suppliers are expected to comply with all applicable rules, laws, and regulations at all times while working with Branch. You have a responsibility to be knowledgeable about specific laws and regulations that apply to your area of business. If a law conflicts with this Supplier Code, you must comply with the law.</span></span> <div><span>  <strong> Diversity and  </strong><strong> Non-Discrimination </strong></span><span>  Diversity is at the forefront of Branch’s mission and culture. We are and remain committed to being a globally diverse, ethical, moral and inclusive company that is tolerant of all individuals from all different backgrounds because we believe the best ideas come from a diverse way of looking at technology and the world.</span><span>  Accordingly, Suppliers shall provide an environment free from unlawful discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics, such as age, race, religion, national origin, caste, ancestry, disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, pregnancy, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other basis protected by applicable law. Additionally, we expect all Suppliers to promote working environments where all individuals are entitled to equal opportunities and fair treatment.</span></div> <div><span>  <strong> Anti-Harassment </strong></span><span>  Each Supplier shall ensure its workplace is free of harassment. Harassment means any verbal, physical, and visual conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile working environment or that interferes with an individual’s work performance. Harassing conduct can take many forms and may include, but is not limited to, the following: slurs, jokes, statements, gestures, assault, impeding or blocking another’s movement or otherwise physically interfering with normal work, or sharing inappropriate materials. </span></div> <div><span>  <strong> Non-Retaliation </strong></span><span>  No Supplier will retaliate against an individual for filing a good faith complaint of unlawful discrimination or harassment or for participating in any good faith investigation of alleged discrimination or harassment. </span></div> <div><h2>  Conflicts of Interest</h2><span>  Branch expects all Suppliers to avoid conflicts of interest and to operate with the highest level of ethics and integrity. A potential conflict of interest, or the appearance of one, occurs when your outside interests (for example, financial or personal interests) interfere with or influence, or even just appear to interfere with or influence, yours or Branch’s business interests or your work-related duties. </span><span>  Suppliers may give and accept common courtesy items that are of modest cost, provided for legitimate business purposes and are understood as customary in Supplier’s industry. However, Suppliers must refrain from giving or accepting any gifts or other items with an intent to influence Branch, its customers, prospects, agents, employees or representatives or to obtain an improper business advantage, or in exchange for favors or benefits.   </span></div> <div><h2>  Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery</h2><span>  Branch Supplier's are strictly prohibited from partaking in any and all forms of corruption and bribery, including, but not limited to, payment or receipt of bribes or kickbacks to or from foreign or domestic government employees or officials, representatives of commercial enterprises or any other persons, whether made directly or through others such as agents, consultants or other associated parties. Suppliers will take all necessary steps to ensure that corruption and bribery do not occur in its business activities, wherever those business activities may take place. Violations of this nature may result in the termination of Supplier's partnership with Branch and may also lead to civil and criminal penalties. </span></div> <span><span>  Suppliers will also ensure their compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable laws that prohibit unlawful activities to procure a business advantage.</span></span> <div><span>  <strong> Antitrust </strong></span><span>  Suppliers shall refrain from engaging in any and all acts which are or may be considered counter to antitrust and fair competition legislation and regulations. Additionally, Branch expects its Suppliers to promote a free, open and competitive marketplace by avoiding all forms of anti-competitive acts or collusion. Suppliers’ responsibilities under this section shall apply wherever a Supplier conducts business.</span><span>  <strong> Confidential Information, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property </strong></span></div> <span><span>  Our customers, partners and employees entrust us to safeguard their confidential information with the utmost security. As follows, Branch expects all of its Suppliers to protect confidential information and trade secrets regarding Branch and its business practices. Branch confidential information should only be used in accordance with existing confidentiality obligations for authorized purposes, disclosed on a need-to-know basis, and subject to separate written confidentiality obligations. Similarly, intellectual property including, but not limited to trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, logos, and other inventions, belonging to Branch, shall be handled with the appropriate level of care and preserved to the extent legally permissible. We encourage all Suppliers to regularly review their confidentiality practices.</span></span> <span><span>  In the event Supplier controls or processes personal information and/or personal data as defined under applicable data protection laws, Suppliers must ensure that their control and processing of such information and data is in accordance with applicable data protection laws, rules, statutes, and regulations. Suppliers are expected to maintain a privacy policy describing its privacy practices and handling of personal information.</span></span> <div><span>  <strong> Healthy Workplace and Labor Practices </strong></span><span>  Branch Suppliers must provide all employees with safe and healthy workplace conditions that comply with all applicable laws.</span><span>  Suppliers will also refrain from engaging or attempting to engage in any and all forms of child labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking in violation of all applicable laws.</span><span>  <strong> Environmental Protection </strong></span><span>  Branch Suppliers shall conduct their business and operations in such a manner that is respectful, responsible and protective of the environment. At a minimum, Suppliers shall comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards. Whenever possible, Branch encourages its Suppliers to continually review their internal operations in order to reduce waste, promote clean air initiatives, and conserve resources.</span></div> <div><span>  <strong> International Trade and Export Controls </strong></span><span>  Branch expects Suppliers to comply with all applicable import, export, customs, sanctions, embargoes, boycott and other trade compliance laws and regulations during the entirety of Branch and Supplier’s engagement.</span><span>  <strong> Accurate and Complete Books and Records </strong></span><span>  All Suppliers must maintain accurate records of all transactions and ensure that the Supplier’s books and records accurately and fairly reflect, with appropriate detail, all transactions, expenses, or other dispositions of assets with regard to its business with Branch. No Supplier employee or other worker shall falsify or otherwise mislead Branch with regard to any records or books Supplier maintains.</span></div> <div><span>  <strong> Reporting Breaches of this Policy </strong></span><span>  Compliance with this Supplier Code is, first and foremost, the personal responsibility of Suppliers, including every individual employed by Supplier. All personnel are encouraged to report, in person or in writing, any known or suspected violations of this Supplier Code to Branch at <a href="http://legal@branch.io/" target="_blank"> legal@branch.io </a>. Any questions or violation reports will be addressed promptly.</span></div> <span><span>  Branch will not tolerate any retaliation by Supplier against any individual who acts in good faith in reporting any violation of this Supplier Code. Supplier will investigate reported violations and will determine an appropriate response, including corrective action and preventive measures, and will include Branch in this process at its request.</span></span> <div><span>  <strong> *** </strong></span></div> <div><h2>  Technical Audit Services SOW</h2><label>  Version</label></div> <div><h5>  Effective June 7, 2023</h5></div> <div><h3>  Table of Contents</h3><span>  Technical Audit Services</span><span>  Statement of Work</span><span>  https://legal.branch.io/#professional-services</span><ul>  <li><strong> SCOPE OF AUDIT SERVICES </strong></li></ul><td>  <strong> Service </strong></td><td>  <strong> Description </strong></td><td>  <strong> Discovery </strong></td><ul>  <li>Conduct remote discovery sessions to assist with identifying Customer's integration settings of Branch and review documentation of their configuration</li><li>Gather information on Customer’s use cases and priorities</li><li>Meet with Customer’s key stakeholders and personnel to gather information about the Customer's current system and integration of Branch</li></ul></div> <div><td>  <strong> Engagement Management </strong></td><ul>  <li>Support Customers in tracking requests and action items</li><li>Conduct regular cadence check-ins to review status of the Audit Services and any issues or problems identified during the engagement</li><li>Provide guidance and assistance in identifying key use cases and their expected benefits </li><li>Actively monitor for and escalate risks and issues as they pertain to the Audit Services</li></ul><td>  <strong> Integration Assessment </strong></td></div> <div><ul>  <li>Review Customer’s configuration of its Branch dashboard</li><li>Review Customer’s integration of Branch’s iOS and Android SDKs and associated use cases</li><li>Review Customer’s integration of their Branch provisioned products and associated use cases</li><li>Review analytics tag usage for data hygiene</li></ul><td>  <strong> Summary Findings; Recommendations </strong></td><ul>  <li>Present audit findings to the Customer</li><li>Provide assessment of Customer’s Branch integration and outline recommendations on how to leverage Branch’s Services and their provisioned products and use cases</li><li><strong> PROJECT ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES  </strong></li></ul></div> <div><td>  <strong> Sponsor </strong></td><td>  <strong> Project Manager </strong></td><ul>  <li>Attending all key Project meetings</li><li>Being a point of contact for day-to-day operations</li><li>Securing participation (as required) of key business process owners</li><li>Participating in Project meetings</li></ul><td>  <strong> Functional Consultant(s) / Business Process Owner(s) </strong></td><ul>  <li>Attends Project meetings related to area of ownership</li><li>Assists in the definition of unique processes outside of standard Branch practices</li><li>Participates in user acceptance testing activities</li></ul></div> <div><td>  <strong> Extended Team </strong></td></div> <div><h5>  Effective April 13, 2023  </h5><span>  to  June 7, 2023</span></div> <div><h3>  Table of Contents</h3><span>  Technical Audit Services</span><span>  Statement of Work</span><span>  This Technical Audit Services Statement of Work (“SOW”) describes the Technical Audit Services (herein referred to as “Audit Services” or “Professional Services”) to be performed by Branch Metrics, Inc.
