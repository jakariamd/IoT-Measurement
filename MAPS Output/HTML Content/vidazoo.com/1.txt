The CCPA defines “sharing” as “communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information” to “a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for money or other valuable consideration”.  In other words, we may share your Personal Information to help serve personalized content or ads that may be more relevant to your interests, and to perform other advertising-related services such as enabling our partners to serve such personalized content. </span></div> <span><span>  In the preceding twelve (12) months, we “sell” or “share” the following categories of Personal Information for a business purpose:</span></span> <div><td>  Category (corresponding with the table above)</td><td>  Category Recipient</td><td>  Purpose of Sale or Share</td><td>  Category A</td><td>  Category F</td><td>  Category G</td><td>  Ad-network</td><td>  Share for cross-context behavioral advertising.</td><td>  Category A</td><td>  Marketing and Analytics service providers</td><td>  Marketing and Analytics</td><span>  (F)     CHILDREN UNDER AGE 16</span><span>  We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16.</span></div> <div><span>  (G)    DATA RETENTION</span><span>  In general, we retain the Personal Information we collect for as long as it remains necessary for the purposes set forth above, all under the applicable regulation, or until you will express your preference to opt-out, where applicable.</span><span>  The retention periods are determined according to the following criteria:</span><span>  (i)               For as long as it remains necessary in order to achieve the purpose for which the Personal Information was initially processed. For example: if you contacted us, we will retain your contact information at least until we will address your inquiry.</span></div> <span><span>  (ii)              To comply with our regulatory obligations.
