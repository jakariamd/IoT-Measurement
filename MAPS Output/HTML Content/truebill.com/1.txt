When we collect your Sensitive Personal Information, we collect and use that information to perform the services or provide the goods for which that information is necessary and as reasonably expected by you. </p></div> <div><ul>  <li> Sale Of Personal Information </li></ul><p>   California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia law require certain disclosures for companies that "sell" personal information persuant to the respective state's privacy law. Each state defines the "sale" of data differently. In California, the "sale" of data means certain scenarios in which Rocket has shared personal information with third parties or Affiliates, in exchange for valuable consideration. Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia define the "sale" of data as Rocket exchanging personal information for monetary consideration with a non-affiliated third party. </p></div> <p><p>   Under Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia law, we do not "sell" your personal information. </p></p> <p><p>   Under California's definition, we "sell" personal information to enable our Affiliates and certain third parties to use your information in accordance with their privacy policies. We "sell" the following categories of personal information to the following categories of third parties: </p></p> <div><td>  Identifiers</td><td>  Affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.</td><td>  Categories Of Personal Information Described In Subdivision (e) Of Section 1798.80</td><td>  Affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.</td><td>  Commercial Information</td><td>  Affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.</td><td>  Internet Or Other Network Activity</td><td>  Affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.</td><td>  Inferences Drawn From Other Personal Information</td><td>  Affiliates and non-affiliated third parties.</td></div> <div><ul>  <li> Right to Opt-Out of Selling </li></ul><p>   You have the right to opt out of the "sales" described above at any time by visiting our <a href="#/do-not-sell-my-personal-information" target="_blank"> Do Not Sell My Personal Information </a> webpage. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16. </p><ul>  <li> Right to Opt-Out of Personal Information Being Shared or Used In Targeted Advertising </li></ul><p>   California requires that we notify you if we “Share” your personal information with third parties. In California, “Sharing” means we make available or otherwise disclose your information to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. Further, “cross-context behavioral advertising” means targeting of advertising to you based on your personal information obtained from your activity across businesses, websites, apps, and services other than our Services. </p></div> <p><p>   Similarly, privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia require we notify you if we use your information for Targeted Advertising. Targeted Advertising means displaying advertisements to you where the advertisement is selected based on personal information obtained from your activities over time and across nonaffiliated websites or online applications to predict your preferences or interests. </p></p> <p><p>   Accordingly, we "Share" and use your information for Targeted Advertising. Specifically, we share your identifiers and internet or other network activity with our advertising partners. </p></p> <p><p>  <b> You have the right to opt out of "sharing" or Targeted Advertising by accessing our  </b><a href="#/do-not-sell-my-personal-information" target="_blank"> Do Not Sell My Personal Information </a><b>  webpage. </b></p></p> <div><ul>  <li> Retention of Personal Information </li></ul><p>   We will not retain your personal information for longer than is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes we disclose in this policy. </p><ul>  <li> State Consumer Data Rights </li></ul><p>   Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to (1) request to know more about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we collect, use, disclose and sell, and to access your information, (2) request deletion of your personal information, (3) request correction of your personal information and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights. </p></div> <p><p>  <b> You may make these requests by  </b><a href="https://www.rocketmortgage.com/privacy-rights/data-request?qls=QRD_12345678.0123456789" target="_blank">  starting a request online </a><b>  or calling  </b><a href="tel:888-444-7492" target="_blank"> 888-444-7492 </a><b> .  </b> We'll verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your recent interactions with us. </p></p> <p><p>   If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you've provided such agent with a power of attorney, or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf. <b> If you're an authorized agent seeking to make a request, please contact us as set out above. </b></p></p> <div><ul>  <li> California Financial Incentive Disclosure </li></ul><p>   California’s privacy law requires that we notify you if we provide you a program, benefit, or other offering, related to the collection, deletion, or sale of personal information, which it defines as a “financial incentive.” We may offer you certain financial incentives that may result in different prices, rates, or quality levels (for example, contests and referral programs). Through these offerings, consumers provide us with some personal information (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers) when they opt-in to our programs. There is no obligation to opt-in and consumers may opt-out at any time. The details of each program are contained in the program offering. We offer these programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. We invest heavily in our marketing and brands, in part, so we can provide programs to our customers. Consumer data is valuable to our business only when it is combined with a sufficient number of other consumer data and after it is enhanced by our efforts herein described. The value to our business of any individual consumer's personal information is dependent on a number of factors, including, for example, whether and to what extent you take advantage of any offerings, whether and to what extent you opt out of any offerings, and whether we are able to enhance the data through our efforts herein described. Our ability to create any value from the programs is heavily based on our ability to leverage said intellectual properties. We do not calculate the value of consumer data in our accounting statements. </p></div> <div><ul>  <li> California Consumer Data Requests </li></ul><p>   In 2022, we received 1,401 consumer data requests from California consumers. This includes requests from people to know, access, or delete their data. We also received 957,500 requests from people who opted out of data sharing. </p><p>   Here’s a breakdown of those consumer requests: <b> 254 </b> Right To Know/Access requests <b> 1,147 </b> Right To Delete requests </p><p>  It's taken us a median of 9 days to process and respond to each request.</p></div> <div><h1>  Federal Privacy Notice</h1><p>   Some companies within the Rocket Family of Companies are required to provide an additional Privacy Notice under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
