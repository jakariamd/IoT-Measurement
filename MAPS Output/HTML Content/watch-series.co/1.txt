This inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.</p></p> <div><h4>  Background and Legal Framework for the .CO Top Level Domain</h4><p>  Resolution 161 of 2020 (the ".CO Contract"), issued by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies of Colombia ("MINTIC"), establishes the policy framework for the (a) promotion, administration and operation of the Colombian Internet Top-Level Domain (ccTLD ".CO") and (b) the delegation of domain names under the ".CO" domain.</p><p>  .CO INTERNET S.A.S. is the operator responsible for the operation of the .CO domain, with delegation from and supervision of MINTIC. Under the .CO Contract, the Registry Operator is responsible for providing the .CO registry and a share registration system; promoting and marketing .CO; selling, through registrars, .CO registrations; maintaining the security, stability, and resiliency of .CO; enforcing .CO policies; and reporting on these activities.</p></div> <p><p>  .CO INTERNET S.A.S. is a private company identified with TIN 900.308.815-4, whose domicile is "Calle 100 # 8A-49, Torre B, Oficina 507" in the city of Bogotá D.C., Colombia, zip code 110221069.</p></p> <p><p>  In compliance with Law 1581 / 2012, regulated by Decree 1377 / 2013 and all other laws and regulations on the subject, .CO INTERNET S.A.S. is the Controller of the Personal Data of its clients, registrants, users, suppliers, vendors, employees and customers, among others.</p></p> <div><h4>  What information we collect, how we collect it, and why.</h4><p>  Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:</p><ul>  <li>i. create an account (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);
</li><li>ii. register a domain in .CO (ex: name, contact, and nameserver information)

</li><li>iv. complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or
</li><li>v. participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Registrant data. </strong> When you register a domain name, your registrar collects certain information, including the personal information identified above, the name of your Registrar, the IP Address of the servers on which your domain name is hosted, contact information for others involved in operation of the domain, and other information about the domain name registration. We use this information to deliver registry services and for other purposes described below.</p></p> <p><p>  Data on domain names, contact and hosting for each registry under the ccTLD.co is included in a database named the Registry Database for the ccTLD.co.</p></p> <p><p>  Registry Operator and/or the Registrars, as the case may be, carry out the collection, storage, use, circulation, elimination, transmission, transfer and/or reception of such abovementioned data with the following purpose: to administer and/or manage the Registry Database and provide the registry services in order to comply the terms of the Resolution 161 of 2020, the .CO Contract and the guides, policies and supervision of the MINTIC, related to registry operations of such domain names.</p></p> <p><p>  Registry Operator shall not permit access to the Registry Database by individuals other than required for fulfillment of the purpose of the .CO Contract, taking into account in any case the privileges that each shall have regarding access to said Registry Database. Where required in accordance with applicable laws, Registry Operator shall permit access to the Registry Database whenever a Colombian judicial authority so orders.</p></p> <p><p>  Registry Operator may not sell the personal data contained in the database, neither in a disaggregated manner, nor jointly, nor by anonymizing the data. Registry Operator does not have nor will it develop any intellectual property right regarding the data in the Registry Database and this Database is at the service of the Colombian Nation, the Registered Users and the Internet community in general.</p></p> <p><p>  Registry Operator shall be responsible for processing the personal data of the Registry Database, under the terms stipulated in Law 1581 of 2012 and its regulatory provisions, as well as those that modify, complement or replace them.</p></p> <p><p>  Registry Operator has a Mirror Database/Escrow File available to the MINTIC and the Emergency Operator (EBERO) for the purposes of Supervision and Emergency Transition, if required, which replicates the contents of the Registry Database.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> DNS services, </strong> we provide a variety of Domain Name System (DNS) services to facilitate the global flow of Internet traffic.

We analyze the attack vector information containing the source and destination IP Addresses, attack duration, and traffic volume to enhance our ability to detect and mitigate malicious activity on the Internet more broadly. Based on this analysis, we may share information about malicious activities, blocked hostnames or IP Addresses, source and target geolocation data, and target industry or vertical information with third parties such as internet security research groups and service providers to prevent, detect, and mitigate against malicious online behavior.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Cookies and similar technologies </strong> on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services.
