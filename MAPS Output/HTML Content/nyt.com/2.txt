        </h1><p>  <em> Last Updated on July 6, 2023 </em></p><p>  At The Times, our mission is to seek the truth and help people understand the world. We want you to understand how we handle your personal information. We also want you to know your rights and choices.</p><p>  This policy describes how we handle your personal information when you use the “Times Services,” listed below:</p><ul>  <li>The New York Times newspaper, plus our International Edition</li><li>Our websites, <em> like nytimes.com </em></li><li>Our apps, <em> like the New York Times app and the New York Times Games app </em></li><li>Our email newsletters<em> , like Cooking and Morning Briefing </em></li><li>Our pages or ads on social media networks, <em> like our Facebook and Instagram pages </em></li><li>Anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this Privacy Policy</li></ul></div> <p><p>  How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you use — and how you use them. For example, we use different information about print subscribers than website visitors.</p></p> <p><p>  Be aware that certain Times Services work differently. Some have additional terms that supplement this policy <em> (e.g.,  </em><em> Reader Submissions </em>. Others, like <a href="https://privacy.theathletic.com/policies?name=global-privacy-policy" target="_blank"> The Athletic </a>, refer to a different privacy policy altogether, so this one does not apply in those cases.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nytimes.com" target="_blank"> privacy@nytimes.com </a></p></p> <span><span>  .

What Information Do We Gather about You? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The information we gather about you depends on the context. By and large, it’s information about you that can personally identify you — either on its own or when combined with other information.</p></p> <p><p>  The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 1. (A) Information Collected through Times Services. </em></p></p> <p><p>  i. <strong> Information You Voluntarily Give Us </strong></p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> For Registration: </strong></li></ul><p>  When you sign up for a Times Service <em> (e.g., a subscription) </em>, we collect your contact information and account credentials. Once you’re registered, we assign you a unique ID number. This ID number helps us recognize you when you’re signed in.</p><p>  For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account. See <a href="#1.C)" target="_blank"> Information Collected From Other Sources </a> below.</p></div> <p><p>  If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information <em> (e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions) </em>.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> For Billing: </strong></li></ul><p>  To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information.</p><p>  This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.</p><ul>  <li><strong> For User-Generated Content: </strong></li></ul><p>  We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read <em> (e.g., comments or recipe reviews) </em>. Anyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts. See the <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014792387-Comments" target="_blank"> Comments F.A.Q. </a>, or read the <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service#3" target="_blank"> User-Generated Content </a> section in our <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428" target="_blank"> Terms of Service </a> for more information.</p></div> <p><p>  We do not have to publish any of your content. If the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, we will comply to the required extent.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers: </strong></li></ul></ul> <p><p>  When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs: </strong></li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs, including demographic information like your age, ethnicity, race, or gender. We also conduct similar research for advertisers. We ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> During Contact  </strong><strong> ith Our Call Centers: </strong></li></ul><p>  We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers. This can include your name, contact information and any other information you choose to provide.</p><ul>  <li><strong> Personal Contacts Data: </strong></li></ul><p>  We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.</p><p>  With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances <em> (e.g., Refer a Friend campaigns) </em>. This functionality is only meant for U.S. residents. By using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States — and that you have everyone’s consent for us to use their contact information.</p></div> <p><p>  ii. <strong> Information Collected Automatically </strong></p></p> <p><p>  When you use Times Services, we collect some information automatically. The technologies we use to assist with this data collection include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts and software development kits (or SDKs). We use these technologies on our digital properties, including our websites and apps, as well as in our email communications and newsletters. For more information about tracking methods on Times Services, and how to manage them, read our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription/dg-cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a> and the <a href="#4" target="_blank"> What Are Your Rights and Choices? </a> section below.</p></p> <div><p>  The categories of personal information we collect automatically include:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Identifiers and Device Information </strong></li></ul><p>  When you visit our Services, including our websites, apps, email communications and newsletters, our servers automatically log information about the device you are using, including unique identifiers. If your browser doesn’t accept our cookies or similar technologies, you can’t access certain parts of our websites <em> (e.g., your account on nytimes.com) </em> The items we log include:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Your IP address</li><li>Cookie identifiers</li><li>Your operating system and browser (e.g., type, version, and configuration)</li><li>Your browser language</li><li>Device identifiers (such as MAC address)</li><li>Advertising identifiers</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We combine this data with other information we collect about you. </p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Geolocation Information </strong></li></ul><p>  Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location if you enable this feature. Your GPS location is your precise geolocation, which is considered a type of sensitive personal information.</p><p>  You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the app. You can edit that setting on your device at any time. If you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app. If you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider’s servers — <a href="#2" target="_blank"> see below </a> for the definition of service provider.</p></div> <p><p>  If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific app does not have location-based features, we don’t collect your precise GPS location. We do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location. Ads on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate location but are never targeted based on your GPS location.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Other Usage Data: </strong></li></ul><p>  We collect certain internet and network activity on our Services, including our websites and apps, such as the URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps, the URL of the website from which you came to our sites, how long you spent on a page, access times and other details about your use of and actions on our Services.</p><p>  iii. <strong> A  </strong><strong> ote about  </strong><strong> ensitive  </strong><strong> ersonal  </strong><strong> nformation </strong></p></div> <p><p>  We generally don’t want to gather sensitive information about you. This includes:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Government-issued IDs (such as your driver’s license, passport or social security number)</li><li>Your racial or ethnic origin</li><li>Your political opinions</li><li>Your religion or other beliefs</li><li>Your health, biometric or genetic characteristics</li><li>Any trade union membership</li><li>Your sexuality (information about your sex life or sexual orientation)</li><li>Any criminal background</li><li>The content of your private communications (other than messages you may send to us)</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  However, as discussed above, we sometimes collect precise geolocation information (which may be considered a sensitive data type) to provide GPS-based location services you choose to enable. Also, some laws define account access information, such as a username and password, as sensitive personal information, but we collect that information only for the accounts you create directly with us and not for any other account you may have with a third party.</p></p> <p><p>  Finally, there are situations when we request certain of the above information <em> (e.g., a reader survey asks about your political leanings </em><em>  or ethnicity </em>, but you can decline to answer. Outside those situations we would prefer you never share these types of information with us.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 1. (B) Information We Create or Generate.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics (“inferences”).</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 1. (C </em><em> ) Information Collected  </em><em> rom Other Sources. </em></p></p> <p><p>  i. <strong> Privately Owned Databases: </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information — like public data, survey data and more. This data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.</p></p> <p><p>  ii. <strong> Social Media Platforms and Other Third-Party Services: </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <em> (Social media platforms include  </em><em> services like Facebook. Third-party services include  </em><em> services like  </em><em> Google and Nook.) </em></p></p> <p><p>  You can link your social media or other third-party account to a Times Service. By linking the services, you authorize us to collect, store and use any information they may give us <em> (e.g., your email address) </em>. You can disconnect your nytimes.com registration from third-party accounts at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  We also receive information from you when you interact with our pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms. This includes aggregate data on our followers <em> (e.g., age, gender and location) </em>, engagement data <em> (e.g., “likes,” comments, shares, reposts and clicks) </em>, awareness data <em> (e.g., number of impressions and reach) </em> and individual users’ public profiles.</p></p> <p><p>  For more information, refer to our <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014887628-Social-login" target="_blank"> social login </a> and <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014917867-NOOK-subscribers" target="_blank"> Nook </a> F.A.Q.</p></p> <p><p>  iii. <strong> Workplace and Schools: </strong></p></p> <p><p>  When your employer or school buys an organization-wide subscription to nytimes.com, they sometimes provide us with your name and organization email address to grant you access as a user.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2. What Do We Do  </strong><strong> ith  </strong><strong> he Information We Collect  </strong><strong> bout You? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We use each of the categories of personal information described above for the following business and commercial purposes. The activities below can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (“service providers”) to whom we disclose your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below in <a href="#3" target="_blank"> Section 3 </a> of this Privacy Policy).</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 2. (A) We  </em><em> rovide the Times Services. </em></p></p> <p><p>  We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Making a Times Service available to you</li><li>Arranging access to your account</li><li>Providing customer service</li><li>Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints</li><li>Completing your payments and transactions</li><li>Sending service-related messages <em> (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions) </em></li><li>Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches</li><li>Displaying your Games (including Crossword, Wordle, and Spelling Bee) stats</li><li>Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> 2. (B) We Personalize Your Experience. </em></p></p> <p><p>  We track your interests and reading habits <em> (e.g., the articles you read) </em> to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning. This is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you’ve already read. For more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003965994-Personalization" target="_blank"> Personalization F.A.Q. </a> We also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you’ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 2. (C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content. </em></p></p> <p><p>  Any information you disclose in your content becomes public — along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 2. (D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis. </em></p></p> <p><p>  We analyze data on our users’ subscriptions, purchases and usage behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions.</p></p> <p><p>  For example, our analysis, which includes the use of technology like machine learning, lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services. It helps us determine whether our marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.</p></p> <p><p>  Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use. You can find out <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank"> how Google Analytics uses data </a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"> how to opt out of Google Analytics </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 2. (E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks. </em></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.</li><li>For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.</li><li>For customer satisfaction: We assess users’ satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> 2. (F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions. </em></p></p> <p><p>  You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 2. (G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers. </em></p></p> <p><p>  We gather data and work with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/third-party" target="_blank"> third parties </a> to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers. This data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party <em> (e.g., cookies) </em>, the information you provide <em> (e.g., your email address) </em>, your use of Times Services <em> (e.g., your reading history) </em>, information from advertisers or advertising vendors <em> (e.g., demographic data) </em> and anything inferred from any of this information. We only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity. For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on your visit to nytimes.com and other sites. You can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en" target="_blank"> related Google privacy policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers. To do this, we combine information we collect through surveys or registration with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps. This combined information is used to build models. These data models are then used to measure users’ attributes, like their demographic information or their interests. Working with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes. Each group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our sites and apps.</p></p> <p><p>  Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations. Times Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us. These vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor’s URL, we may earn a commission.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> Additional  </em><em> otes: </em></p><ul>  <li>For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank"> DAA Webchoices Browser Check  </a>and <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank"> NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising </a>. You can <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank"> download the AppChoices app </a> to opt out in mobile apps. You can also follow the instructions in the <a href="#4" target="_blank"> What Are Your Rights and Choices? </a> section below.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you. Many of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own. Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients. This helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads; check <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/third-party" target="_blank"> their privacy policies for more details </a>. For further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription/dg-cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>. As described in more detail below, California residents have the right to instruct us not to “sell” or “share” their personal information. Residents of Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia have the right to opt out of “targeted advertising” and "sales" (as defined under applicable law). For more information, please see the <a href="#4" target="_blank"> What Are Your Rights and Choices? </a> section below.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> 2. (H) We Advertise </em><em>  or Market </em><em>  Times Services to You. </em></p></p> <p><p>  We market our Times Services to you. Sometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.</p></p> <p><p>  We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties. Often these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed to or purchased anything. The ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.</p></p> <p><p>  We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service. The third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data. Because of how this matching process works, the third party can’t read our encrypted customer list if they don’t already have it. We will also opt you out of such matched ads if you are a California resident and you exercise your right not to have your personal information “sold,” as discussed further <a href="#4.B)iii." target="_blank"> below </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/privacy/third-party" target="_blank"> third parties </a>. For example, when we use “Custom Audiences” to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out. We are not responsible for any third party’s failure to comply with opt-out requests.</p></p> <p><p>  We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails. For information on opting out of these emails, see <a href="#4" target="_blank"> What Are Your Rights and Choices? </a> below.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 2. (I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information  </em><em> nto Larger Findings. </em></p></p> <p><p>  Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, as defined under applicable laws. This helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results. We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 3. To </strong><strong>  Whom Do We  </strong><strong> Disclose or Share  </strong><strong> the Information We Gather? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3. (A) Within The New York Times Company: </em></p></p> <p><p>  Our affiliates may access your information for the purposes listed here. Our affiliates include the companies on this <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004990014" target="_blank"> list </a>; our affiliates also include <a href="https://theathletic.com/" target="_blank"> The Athletic </a>, which has its own <a href="https://privacy.theathletic.com/policies?name=global-privacy-policy" target="_blank"> privacy policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3. (B) With Service Providers: </em></p></p> <p><p>  We work with service providers, as defined above, to carry out certain tasks, including:</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Processing your payments</li><li>Fulfilling your orders</li><li>Maintaining technology and related infrastructure</li><li>Offering you customer service</li><li>Serving and targeting ads</li><li>Measuring ad performance</li><li>Presenting surveys</li><li>Shipping you products and mailings</li><li>Distributing emails</li><li>List processing and analytics</li><li>Managing and analyzing research</li><li>Managing promotions</li></ul><p>  When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your personal information.</p></div> <p><p>  We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3. (C) With Other Third Parties: </em></p></p> <p><p>  There are situations when we disclose your information to third parties beyond our service providers. As disclosed in prior versions of this Privacy Policy, we have historically never disclosed your email address to these third parties without your consent, except in encrypted form to engage in the matched ads process described <a href="#2.H)" target="_blank"> above. </a></p></p> <p><p>  It is worth noting how practices of certain vendors and changes in law outside of our control have changed what we can say about this. First, as noted elsewhere in this Policy, to the extent regulators take the position that the disclosure of information for matched ads is a “sale,” we will opt you out of such matched ads if you are a resident of an applicable jurisdiction and you exercise your right not to have your personal information “sold.”</p></p> <p><p>  Second, at least one of our vendors uses pseudonymized email addresses they receive from us to power products that they provide to us and their other customers. Therefore, it is possible that your email address, which was shared with our vendor to provide services to us, is being used in pseudonymized form by the vendor to provide products and services to other companies.</p></p> <p><p>  While we try to control the behavior of our vendors that we understand to be service providers, some of those vendors engage in activities beyond our control that may be seen by a regulator as the activities of “third parties,” not service providers.</p></p> <p><p>  The following provides more information about the circumstances in which we know we are disclosing personal information to third parties that are not service providers.</p></p> <p><p>  i. If you’re a U.S. print subscriber, we may provide your name and mailing address (among other information) to other companies that want to market to you by mail.

You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information. Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.</p></p> <p><p>  Please see <a href="#4.A)ii." target="_blank"> Access, Correct, Change/Update, Delete, or Restrict Processing of Your Personal Information </a> above for details, including on how to exercise these rights and how we verify your identity.</p></p> <p><p>  iii. <strong> “Do Not Sell </strong><strong>  or Share </strong><strong>  My Personal Information” </strong></p></p> <p><p>  To the extent The New York Times Company “sells” your personal information (as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA), you have the right to opt-out of that “sale” on a going-forward basis at any time. </p></p> <p><p>  If you’re a California resident, you have a right to opt-out from the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information with third parties who are not our service providers (as those terms are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, or “CCPA” for short in this Policy). To exercise this right, click the "Your Privacy Choices" link on the bottom of the webpage where your information is being collected or go to “Account” and then “Settings” and “About This App” and click the “Your Privacy Choices” link there.

In order to do that, please provide the agent with written permission, signed by you, authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf. The agent must submit that written permission along with the request. We will contact you to verify your identity — and the authorized agent’s permission — before a response to the request is sent.</p></p> <p><p>  vi. <strong> Non-Discrimination Rights </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You may exercise any of your rights listed in this section without fear of unlawful discrimination.</p></p> <p><p>  vii. <strong> Record of Requests </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We keep a record of requests that we received from California residents.</p></p> <p><p>  For data deletion and data access requests, our readers submit requests through our intake <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/data-subject-request" target="_blank"> form </a>. In the intake form, they mark whether they reside in California. We then send an identity verification email to the user. If the user does not verify their identity in 45 days, their request will be denied. If the user does verify in 45 days, we begin to fulfill their request.</p></p> <p><p>  We have calculated our median process time for verified data deletion and data access requests. Any requests completed within the same day are rounded to one day. The median process time is found by organizing the processing time of each verified request from lowest to highest.

Email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nytimes.com?subject=California%20Under%2018%20Content%20Removal%20Request" target="_blank"> privacy@nytimes.com </a> with “California Under 18 Content Removal Request” in the subject line and tell us what you want removed. We will make reasonable efforts to remove the post from public view, although we cannot ensure the complete removal of the content and may retain the content as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> . How Long Do You Retain Data? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We store your personal information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law). This means we might retain your personal information even after you close your account with us.</p></p> <p><p>  When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>How long we have had a relationship with you or provided a Times Service to you</li><li>Whether we are subject to any legal obligations <em> (e.g., any laws that require us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time before we can delete them) </em></li><li>Whether we have taken any legal positions <em> (e.g., in connection with any statutes of limitation) </em>.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying details.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> . How Do You Protect My Information? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We protect your personal information with appropriate organizational, technological and physical safeguards — but we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We recommend that you use complex and unique passwords for your Times accounts and for third-party accounts linked to them. Do not share your password with anyone.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure, notify us immediately.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> . Are There Guidelines for Children? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Times Services are intended for a general audience and are not directed at children under (13) years of age.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@nytimes.com" target="_blank"> privacy@nytimes.com </a>. We will remove the data to the extent required by applicable laws.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> . How Is Information Transferred Internationally? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The New York Times Company is headquartered in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States — or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.</p></p> <p><p>  If we transfer your data out of the European Economic Area (E.E.A.), we implement at least one of the two following safeguards:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to E.E.A. standards (see the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target="_blank"> full list of these countries </a>).</li><li>We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by contractual obligations, including E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses together with additional safeguards to protect your personal data. You can see a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank"> copy of these clauses </a>.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> . What Is Our Legal Basis? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  In some jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we only collect, use or share information about you when we have a valid reason. This is called a “lawful basis.” Specifically, this is one of the following:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your information</li><li>The performance of the contract we have with you</li><li>The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject, or</li><li>The legitimate interests of The Times or a third party. “Legitimate interest” is a technical term under international laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests. “Legitimate interest” also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure; (2) to administer and generally conduct business within The New York Times Company; (3) to prevent fraud; and (4) to conduct our marketing activities.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 10 </strong><strong> . What about Third-Party Services? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Some Times Services contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors and advertisers. These third parties are not Times Services. Additionally, Times Services may be available to you through third-party digital properties such as Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). We do not control (and are not responsible for) third party content or privacy practices. These third parties may independently collect and solicit information about you and affect your data preferences when you access the Times Services on third-party digital properties (see “Additional Notes” below for more information). Any personal information you provide to them is not covered by this Privacy Policy. These third parties have their own policies and practices about data, which may include what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and terms of use.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Additional Notes </strong></p><ul>  <li>As mentioned above, some Times Services are offered on third-party digital properties (such as third-party websites, frameworks, and domains) which can affect our data practices and your data preferences. For example, we use Google AMP to help Times Services load quickly on mobile devices. We also use third-party properties to facilitate other Times Services, such as our Live Events.</li><li>If you set your data preferences while using one of these third-party digital properties, your preferences will only be saved with respect to the Times Services on that specific third-party digital property. Your preferences will not carry over when you use the Times Services on The Times’s own digital properties. And, your preferences will only be saved on Google AMP and other third-party digital properties until your cookies are cleared. Once your cookies are cleared, you will need to reset your data preferences for each third-party digital property used to access Times Services.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>If your browser settings allow for cross-site tracking (e.g., allows for trackers to follow your preferences across websites), you can set your preferences on The Times’s digital properties so that your preferences will be remembered when you access the Times Services through Google AMP. However, if your browser settings do not allow for cross-site tracking, your preferences on The Times’s own digital properties will not carry over to the Times Services you access through Google AMP.</li><li>If you are an European resident and you do not accept trackers (other than essential trackers) while using Times Services on AMP, you will be served non-personalized ads. If you do not accept trackers (other than essential trackers) while using the Times Services on The Times’s digital properties, you will receive The Times house ads or no ads at all.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 11 </strong><strong> . How Are Changes to this Privacy Policy Communicated? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We are always improving our products and services, and we create new features regularly. These updates sometimes require us to collect new information or use what we already have differently. Further, the laws regarding personal information and privacy frequently change. As a result, we must periodically update this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  We will post any changes on this page by updating this policy. If we make a significant or material change in the way we collect, use or share your personal information, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to the changes taking effect. We will do this via email or prominent notice within Times Services.
