This privacy statement describes the data E-Planning collects, and the ways it is used. E-Planning is a product of Caraytech S.A. and its affiliates. About E-planning E-Planning provides ad serving and web analytics services to media, advertisers, interactive agencies and ad networks. E-Planning is not itself an ad network, publisher or advertiser, but only provides the technology for them to operate. Personal Data Collection E-Planning does not collect any personal data from users. That is to say, E-Planning does not know your name, social security number, passport number, phone number or any other piece of information that can identify yourself. Cookies E-Planning uses cookies to configure frequency caps on campaigns, so that users do not view the same campaign over and over again. E-Planning also uses cookies to provide its clients reports on the number of distinct cookies that viewed each campaign or visited each web site. The use of cookies is an industry standard. A cookie is a file which is stored in your computer and is sent back to a web site whenever you visit it. Almost all web browsers have an option to disable cookies, in which case no cookies are received or sent. In the case of E-Planning, the only information stored in the cookie is a unique cookie ID, in an encrypted form. The cookie is set to expire 10 years after being set. If you do not wish to deactivate E-Planning cookies, you can easily opt out. Please remember that cookies must be enabled in your browser in order for the opt out function to work. Anonymous Data E-Planning collects anonymous information from users who access its clients' online campaigns or web sites. Such information may include: - Information about ad campaigns viewed - Information about web pages visited - Information about ads users clicked on The information stored allows us to provide our clients with reports about their campaigns and websites. These reports may include the number of distinct cookies or unique IP addresses that viewed each campaign or visited each website. Geolocation E-Planning uses geolocation technology to determine where users are located according to their IP address. The technology is so used to target campaigns as from users' country, region or city. For example, it allows the campaign of a restaurant in New York City to be displayed only for users of that city. E-Planning provides their clients geotargeting in 5 levels: country, region, city, telephone and zip code. The geolocation data base is not 100% accurate. Generally, the user's country may be correctly defined in more than 99% of cases, but, at the level of region or city, the accuracy level decreases almost to 90%, depending on the country. Geolocation is also used to provide our clients reports on traffic by country, region or city. Information Disclosure All information collected by E-Planning is solely for the purpose of providing its clients reports on campaign and website performance. This information is sometimes also used to optimize campaigns so that the highest performing campaigns get shown first. E-Planning may sometimes publish market reports providing average information across all its clients. Those reports do not contain any personal information and moreover, cannot be identified as coming from a certain E-Planning client. For instance, E-Planning may publish a report on average user screen size across all customers. Personal information may be shared and/or used by E-Planning, its affiliates, franchisees, controlled or controlling companies. It is also possible that E-Planning gives the Personal Information to third parties by virtue of a commercial and/or contractual relationship. Policy Update E-Planning may update this Privacy Policy by posting a new version on this website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are familiar with any changes.
