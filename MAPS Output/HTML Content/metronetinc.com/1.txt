</p></p> <div><p>  <u> Privacy Policy </u>
</p><p>  <strong> METRONET </strong> respects the privacy of its Users. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain the types of information <strong> METRONET  </strong>obtains about Users, how the information is obtained, how it is used, how it may be disclosed to others, and how Users may restrict its use or disclosure. This Privacy Policy, although consistent with <strong> METRONET’s </strong> Cable Television Privacy Policy, only applies to <strong> METRONET’s </strong> Internet Services.
</p></div> <p><p>  <u> Personally Identifiable Information </u>: The only personally identifiable information <strong> METRONET </strong> obtains about individual Users through the Services it provides is information supplied voluntarily by the User. Users may provide <strong> METRONET </strong> with name, address, telephone number, billing information, email address, domain name or URL or other personally identifiable information that <strong> METRONET </strong> may use for its own business purposes. <strong> METRONET </strong> may share such information with its partners which perform certain services for <strong> METRONET </strong> and such partners shall have access to User information, to the extent needed to perform their services or as necessary to advance <strong> METRONET </strong> business purposes, including the purpose of contacting Users about new products and services, which may be of specific interest to Users. However, our partners may not use such User information for any other purpose. As a point of clarification, there will be no third party data sharing through <strong> METRONET's </strong> SMS short code program.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Non-Personally Identifiable Information </u>: <strong> METRONET </strong> does collect some non-personally identifiable generic information about Users as a means of measuring the effectiveness of the Services. <strong> METRONET </strong> servers monitor and identify certain User information in the normal course of operation. We collect this information only in the aggregate and use it to evaluate and improve the Services delivered and to provide targeted information that may be of interest to Users. The following are examples of non-personally identifiable generic information.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> IP Addresses </u>: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a User's computer whenever that User is using the World Wide Web. Web site servers can automatically identify individual computers by their IP address. <strong> METRONET </strong> collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information. <strong> METRONET </strong> does not intentionally link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Cookies </u>: Cookies are pieces of information that are used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow <strong> METRONET </strong> to save certain information about a User, such as a password or individual preferences, in order to facilitate and enhance the User's future use of the Services. <strong> METRONET </strong> will not use cookies to retrieve information from a User's computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.
</p></p> <p><p>  Except as otherwise provided in this policy, <strong> METRONET </strong> shall not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, and shall not share that information with any third parties for any reason.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Computer Settings </u>: Settings, technical and other information from your computer, such as your operating system, browser version, connectivity, various communication parameters and other information related to the operation and interaction of the Services may be collected by <strong> METRONET </strong>. Except as otherwise provided in this policy, <strong> METRONET </strong> will use such information solely in order to provide technically appropriate formatting of information provided by <strong> METRONET </strong> and access to the Services. The collection of this information will not include any personally identifiable information about you or any individual User.
</p></p> <div><p>  <u> General Conduct </u>
</p><p>  The Services may be used only for lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation coming to or from any unauthorized network or system is prohibited. Unlawful purposes include, without limitation, unauthorized use of any of the following: material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights; government and military data protected by law and national security; or, university and academic data protected by public policy; or dissemination of material that is obscene; defamatory; or, constitutes wire fraud; an illegal threat; is abusive; obstructive; an invasion of privacy; harassing or libelous; or violates export control laws; or that constitutes “Hate Speech;” or that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, or otherwise violates any law. Any violation of the above, which compromises the integrity of the Services or any other network, is strictly prohibited. Users shall not use the Services in a manner that may expose <strong> METRONET </strong> to criminal or civil liability. Users are further prohibited from assisting any other person in violating any part of this AUPP.
</p></div> <p><p>  <u> Non-Participation </u>: Any User who does not wish to receive further contacts from <strong> METRONET </strong> should send a written request that <strong> METRONET </strong> not contact the ‘non-participating’ User. Please send the written request by U.S. mail in an envelope clearly marked "Privacy-Urgent" to METRONET 8837 Bond Street, Overland Park, KS 66214, Attn: Cinergy Metronet, Legal Counsel.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Process </u>: <strong> METRONET </strong> shall, pursuant to applicable law, regulation or legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, allow access to all available and relevant User information in order to comply with such process and protect <strong> METRONET's </strong> or a User’s rights and property. <strong> METRONET </strong> may also allow access to this User information in special emergencies where physical safety is at risk.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Transfer of Business Assets </u>: <strong> METRONET </strong> considers its User information to be one of its business assets.

</p></div> <div><p>  <u> Responsibility for Content </u>

You shall be solely responsible for all content available on or through your web site, if any, and <strong> METRONET </strong> expressly disclaims any and all liability for any such content. <strong> METRONET </strong> is not obligated to monitor or exercise any editorial control over such material, but reserves the right to do so. In the event that <strong> METRONET </strong> becomes aware that any such material created by Users may violate any part of this AUPP and/or may expose <strong> METRONET </strong> to civil or criminal liability, <strong> METRONET </strong> reserves the right to block access to such material, and suspend or terminate Services provided to any User creating, storing or disseminating such material. <strong> METRONET </strong> further reserves the right to cooperate with legal authorities and third parties in the investigation of alleged wrongdoing, including disclosing the identity of the User that <strong> METRONET </strong> deems responsible for the wrongdoing.
