We believe you deserve to understand and make choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.</p><p>  This Privacy Policy explains how InMarket collects, uses, and may sell or disclose personal information that we receive about you when you use our Services. Our “Services” means our mobile applications, third party mobile applications that incorporate our software development kit (“SDK”), our advertising platform (including our demand side platform), our technology, our websites, and our related services. As of the date of this Privacy Policy, InMarket owns and operates mobile and web-based applications called CheckPoints, ListEase, Key Ring, Unflation, and Out of Milk (the “InMarket Applications”). This list is subject to change. “Third Party Partners” are companies who integrate with or use our Services, such as advertisers (our “customers”), digital marketers, data companies, and publishers who integrate our Services into their mobile applications. We require our Third Party Partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy laws.</p></div> <p><p>  InMarket is a proud member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). We are committed to the core NAI values of notice and choice in digital advertising. We adhere to the <a href="http://aboutads.info/" target="_blank"> Digital Advertising Alliance Codes </a> that apply to our business.</p></p> <p><p>  We partner with third party advertising companies to manage our advertising on the InMarket Applications. Because we enable these third parties on the InMarket Applications, we may be considered to have sold data to these third parties over the past 12 months. Our Third Party Partners may use cookies, hashed identifiers, or similar technologies in order to provide you with relevant advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. This practice is sometimes referred to as personalized, targeted or interest-based advertising. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising from those partners, click <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 1. Sources of Personal Information Collected </b></p></p> <div><p>  Information from You</p><p>  You may provide information manually while using our Services, for example, by typing your name and email address or by using a social profile to register for or update an account in one of the InMarket Applications. Some InMarket Applications invite you to link to your banking or payment card accounts and your retail shopping accounts (such as your online store user account or a store loyalty account). We also collect personal information when you communicate with us for support or any other reason or when you register for a promotion.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Information from our Services </em></p><p>  Our Services may collect personal information through the InMarket Applications, our Third Party Partners’ mobile applications, and our websites. Our Services and our Third Party Partners may also collect data using technology such as cookies, ad tags, and pixels. Web beacons are invisibly embedded electronic images and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use cookies to store this type of information when we serve ads onto Internet browsers. For more information about cookies and web beacons, please visit: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/" target="_blank"> http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/ </a>. Some of our partners send us information directly via a “server to server” file instead of using web technologies like cookies, web beacons or pixels. We also collect mobile advertising identifiers (IDFA for Apple devices or AAID for Android devices), third party proprietary identifiers, ad exposure information such as URL, site name, creative, publisher, and channel, precise geolocation information, session information, operating system, internet protocol address (IP address), hashed email address and device model. All of these technologies help us to deliver relevant ads, provide ad measurement and reporting, and to generate market insights.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Information from Third Party Sources </em></p><p>  We may also collect information about you and your device from third party sources including public databases, social media platforms, data append services, third party marketing partners, data brokers, and others.

We will collect item-level purchase data each day, including the item names and details, date, quantity, price and transaction total using your account info and other store data;(e) internet activity information (for example, information regarding your interactions with a website, mobile application or advertisement, device operating system, browser type‚ referring website, the pages viewed on the website or application, and the application name and version, social profile data);(f) precise geolocation, which is a category of “Sensitive Personal Information” under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as modified by the Consumer Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CCPA as defined below), is a category of “Sensitive Data” under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA);(g) inferences drawn from personal information to create a consumer profile (for example, profiles regarding consumer preferences, behavior, or interests); and(h) Certain information we collect, or inferences we may make, may reveal racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or sexual orientation, which may be “Sensitive Data” under the VCDPA, CPA and CTDPA, and “Sensitive Personal Information” under the CCPA.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 3.

Opt-out of Ad Targeting – Your Choice Mechanisms </b></p></p> <p><p>  InMarket offers consumers the ability to opt-out of our use of your information to serve personalized ads to you across devices, mobile applications, and websites. If you don’t want the information we collect used for the purpose of serving you such personalized ads, we offer a number of choice mechanisms. Please note that none of our choice mechanisms will opt you out of all advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads but they won’t be targeted by us and we will remove opted out browsers or devices from our ad targeting system. Your opt-out choice will be applied only to the browser or device that has opted out.</p></p> <div><p>  (a) </p><span>  Mobile OS Opt-Out. We honor the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074" target="_blank"> “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) </a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en" target="_blank"> “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android) </a>. For devices where we see that such a selection has been made, we will not use information collected from that device to deliver re-targeted advertising.(b) </span></div> <span><span>  Mobile Location Choices. If you’d like to adjust your setting regarding the use of precise geolocation information by third parties such as InMarket, you may do so via the privacy settings on your device. This can either be done globally across all apps by turning off Location Services, or for specific apps. Mobile applications that collect precise geolocation information typically offer mechanisms in the operating system settings to control the collection and use of precise geolocation information. Please note that these choice mechanisms won’t impact previously collected precise geolocation information.(c) </span></span> <span><span>  Connected TV/Over the Top Streaming (“CTV/OTT”). InMarket does not collect data through CTV/OTT streaming devices, but some data we collect may be used to target ads on CTV/OTT devices. You may limit ad tracking on many CTV/OTT devices; your device manufacturer may provide instructions for updating ad tracking settings. The NAI provides additional information on opting out on CTV/OTT devices and instructions for updating privacy preferences of many such devices at <a href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/connected-tv-choices/" target="_blank"> Connected TV Choices </a>.(d) </span></span> <span><span>  Hashed Personally Identifiable Information. Consumers who wish to opt out of the use of hashed PII for interest-based advertising should visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s <a href="https://youradchoices.com/token" target="_blank"> AdChoices token opt-out page </a> to submit a request.(e) InMarket voluntarily provides opt-out rights to any consumer that wishes, regardless of their state of residence. To opt-out, you may complete this <a href="https://inmarket.com/opt-out/" target="_blank"> Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information (Opt Out) </a> form, click on the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link provided on our websites and in our applications, or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@inmarket.com" target="_blank"> privacy@inmarket.com </a>.</span></span> <p><p>  <b> 5. Notice of Financial Incentives </b></p></p> <p><p>  InMarket offers financial incentives to consumers in exchange for the consumer sharing certain personal information with us through websites and mobile applications we own, such as CheckPoints.</p></p> <p><p>  In the CheckPoints mobile application, consumers can earn points redeemable in a rewards program in exchange for various activities such as sharing precise geolocation information (for example, by visiting a retail location), scanning product barcodes in a retail location, sharing purchase records, taking surveys, and sharing personal information such as name and email address. The specific instructions for how to participate and the rewards offered as incentives in each mobile application may vary and are set out within each mobile application. Additional voluntary incentive opportunities may be presented from time to time in the InMarket Applications.</p></p> <p><p>  We collect and use the information we obtain through the InMarket Applications to further our business in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We offer an incentive to consumers who provide us with information through the InMarket Applications because it allows us to gain insights into consumer trends and habits. We value the information a consumer provides us through the InMarket Applications as equal to the value of the reward that we provide for sharing the information. InMarket receives a nominal fee for certain completed surveys in the CheckPoints mobile application, which is the basis upon which we value this CheckPoints survey information. Regarding the rest of the data for which we offer an incentive in the InMarket Applications, one consumer’s data has nominal value to us because in large data sets that also include data collected without incentive, the utility and value of the set is only nominally enhanced by the inclusion of one additional entry.</p></p> <p><p>  To participate in any of these incentive-based offers you can opt-in by intentionally sharing the required information through the InMarket Applications.</p></p> <p><p>  You can opt-out of participation in any of our incentive-based offers at any time. If you wish to opt-out, stop submitting additional information and please submit a “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” request or a “Delete My Personal Information” request as described below this Privacy Policy. You may also delete the mobile application.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 6.
