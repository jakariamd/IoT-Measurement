Recruitee is a web service implemented on the Verve website. Applicant data is stored by Recruitee on our behalf. The data is transferred in encrypted form and stored in data centers in Europe. We have concluded a data processing agreement with Recruitee pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR, which ensures that Recruitee processes the data exclusively in accordance with our instructions and guarantees the upholding of European data protection principles. We kindly ask for your understanding that due to data privacy reasons we can’t process applications received outside of Recruitee.

You may also provide us with additional information that you may want us to consider when you apply (e.g. your salary expectations, availability or additional documents).

We store your applicant data upon receipt of your application. If we accept your application and subsequently employ you, we will store your applicant data for as long as the data is necessary for your employment and as far as we are legally required to retain it. If we reject your application, we will store your applicant data for a maximum of six months after rejection of your application, unless you give us your consent to longer storage (Verve talent pool). The data will be deleted automatically after this period. This also applies to applicant data stored by one of the ventures in our portfolio as part of the application process.</p></p> <div><p>  b) Verve talent pool</p><p>  If you consent to become part of our talent pool, we will store the data you submitted for your application in our Verve talent pool for a further 24 months.

Your data will not be used by the service provider independently to send the newsletter.</p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> How Personal Information is Controlled or Corrected </strong></h3><p>  In the event you provide us with Personal Information, you can review, correct, or request its deletion, by emailing us at privacy@verve.com.
