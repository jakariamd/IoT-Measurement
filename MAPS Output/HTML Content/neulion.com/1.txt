</td><p>  We may also use the information we have about you</p><ul>  <li>as necessary if we believe there has been a breach of the Terms of Use or the rights of any third party, or</li><li>to comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We combine information we receive from other sources with information you give to us and information we collect about you. We use this combined information for the purposes set out above.</p></p> <p><p>  We also aggregate and anonymize any personal information that we collect in connection with our Online Services, such that the information is no longer personally identifiable or attributable to you. We use such aggregated and anonymized information for our own legitimate business purposes.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Location Data </strong></p><p>  We may collect general location information or more specific location information from you. General information, such as your country or postal code, is used for a variety of reasons, such as determining which country you reside in so we can determine whether we have the rights to show certain content to you or if we need to assess local taxes. This also helps personalize the Online Services so we show you relevant content, including ads.</p><p>  In limited situations, we use more specific location information in order to show you ads personalized to you and your interests. For instance, if you attend an event of one of our Content Providers, we may use associated, more specific location information provided by you or third party data providers in order to tailor content and advertisements based on your attendance.</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that we operate the Online Services on behalf of Content Providers, whose privacy policies address data collection and use in connection with the specific application and content you are using. Please review the applicable privacy policy of the specific application you are using to determine whether and how Content Providers may collect or use location data.</p></p> <p><p>  Many apps and mobile operating systems allow you to limit the collection of location data from your mobile devices. Please review your app and phone settings for more information.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Cookies And Advertising </strong></p><p>  We, our affiliates, our service providers, and our business partners also collect certain information about the use of our Online Services by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, and other technologies.</p><p>  We and our service providers and business partners collect information about website users’ online activities over time and across third-party websites. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based do-not-track (“<strong> DNT </strong>”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.</p></div> <div><p>  The information that may be collected by automated means includes:</p><ul>  <li>URLs that refer users to our Online Services</li><li>Search terms used to reach our Online Services</li><li>Details about the devices that are used to access our Online Services (such as IP address, browser type, and operating system information)</li><li>Details about users’ interaction with our Online Services (such as the date, time, frequency, and length of visits, and specific pages accessed during the visits)</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Web browsers may offer users of our Online Services the ability to disable receiving certain types of cookies; however, if cookies are disabled, some features or functionality of our Online Services may not function correctly. To support and enhance the Online Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties to serve advertisements, through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these ad networks and other parties, although you have choices about those practices as described below. Advertisements served through the Online Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category, which may be inferred from information you provide to us or based on your Services usage patterns. We do not separately provide any personal information to ad networks, beyond cookie data that they may collect in connection with the Online Services. To learn more about ad networks and to adjust your preferences, please click <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising?DB_OEM_ID=30000" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Some of the ad networks and our business partners that collect information about your activities on our Online Services may be members of organizations or programs that provide you with choices regarding the use of your browsing behavior for purposes of targeted advertising. For example, you may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites from members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?DB_OEM_ID=30000&c=1#!/" target="_blank"> here  </a>or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?DB_OEM_ID=30000&c=2#!/" target="_blank"> here </a>. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/?DB_OEM_ID=30000" target="_blank"> here </a>, selecting your country, and then clicking “Choices” (or similarly titled link). Mobile app users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile apps through members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the AppChoices mobile app, available <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices?DB_OEM_ID=30000" target="_blank"> here </a>, and selecting your choices.</p></p> <p><p>  For more information on how Endeavor Streaming uses cookies, please click <a href="https://www.endeavorstreaming.com/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> How We Share Your Information </strong></p><p>  We share data with third parties, including Content Providers and Endeavor, and the other categories of partners as listed above.

Accordingly, we offer the option for you to opt out of the sale of your personal information, as further set forth below.</p><p>  We may also disclose your personal information to third parties:</p><ul>  <li>If we enter into negotiations to buy, sell, or merge some or all of our business or assets, or if we enter into bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective or eventual seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li><li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in the event of an emergency, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.endeavorstreaming.com/terms" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a> and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Endeavor Streaming, Endeavor, our Content Providers, customers, website users, or others; and </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to any third party (whether or not covered in this Policy) with your prior consent.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> Social Media </strong></p><p>  When you choose to share information with your social media account about your activities on our Services, including shows you watch or like on the Endeavor Streaming platform or any other aspect of our Online Services, information about you and your activities will be shared with that social network.
