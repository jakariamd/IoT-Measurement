<div><h1>  Your Privacy Choices</h1></div> <div><h2>  State Opt-out Rights</h2><p>  Residents of certain US states, including California and Virginia, have the right to opt out of having their personal information used or sold for certain purposes. Rights may vary by state, but below we offer a unified option to exercise those rights.</p><p>  Your rights include opting out of the “sale” of data and use or sharing of your personal data with third parties for cross-context personalized advertising. Cross-context personalized advertising means ads are targeted based on personal data gathered from activity over time and across non-affiliated properties. Opting out does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from eBay, or that your eBay experience will not be personalized based on your eBay activity.  But the eBay ads you see will no longer be tailored to you based on the combination of your eBay activity with your activity on non-affiliated websites, applications, and online services.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Error: We were unable to complete your request.
