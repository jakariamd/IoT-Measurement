</p></p> <div><h2>  General philosophy of privacy</h2><p>  Here at <a href="/index.php/Pulsed_Media" target="_blank"> Pulsed Media </a> customer privacy is <i> very highly respected and protected </i>. The main philosophy is that <i> customer data and information is theirs, not ours and we do not even want to know of what is stored, or any other information which is considered private unless we are required to </i>. We consider data you store to our servers to be your private information, and looking into that would be like looking at your home computer hard drive: <i> Not our business! </i>.
</p></div> <p><p>  We are required to gather certain details, and retain those details of all customers however, commonly for accounting and tax purposes (Country, name, mailing address).
</p></p> <div><h2>  Cookies</h2><p>  For some features cookies are a must, but their usage has been minimized to the bare essential requirements such as user sessions and other security related things. Without these, for example billing, would not be accessible. Some sections of our services use 3rd party site analytics and these entail some cookies, these are considered essential.
</p></div> <div><h2>  E-Mail Retention</h2><p>  Emails from our billing system are retained for 3 years maximum and emails older than 3 years are automatically cleaned from the production billing database.
