    You are entitled to a 30-day trial period starting on the day your installation is completed. If you are not happy with the service within the 30 day window, we will refund the payment made at installation. For some accounts, this may require returning a modem or antenna to the Monkeybrain's SF office.  </p><p>  
    If you decide to cancel service beyond the 30-day trial period, your installation fees will not be refunded. Due to the quarterly payment schedule, service canceled mid-quarter will be refunded for the calendar month(s) following your termination date.  </p></div> <p><p>  
    Any refunds issued for a residential account must be done electronically (no cash or check). This requires a subscriber to have enabled recurring electronic payments and/or have an active paypal account to receive any refund.  </p></p> <div><h2>  Our Services</h2></div> <div><h2>  About Us</h2></div> <div><h2>  Contact Us</h2></div> <div><h2>  Misc</h2></div>
