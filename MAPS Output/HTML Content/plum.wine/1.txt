<div><h1>  Plum Privacy Policy</h1></div> <div><h2>  Plum Privacy Policy</h2><p>  At Plum, we take your privacy seriously.</p><p>  This document explains what kind of information Wine Plum, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Plum”) collects and stores, including Personally Identifiable Information (i.e., data that can be reasonably linked to a specific individual or household) in connection with the operation of the Plum Appliance (collectively, “Plum Products”).</p><p>  <strong> We pledge to: </strong></p><p>  -Be transparent about the types of information we collect and how we use them</p></div> <p><p>  -Ask your permission before sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for purposes other than to provide Plum’s services, and to do so only when we think it will be a welcome additional service</p></p> <div><p>  -Use our best efforts to keep your data safe and protect Plum Products from unauthorized access</p><p>  By using this service, you agree to allow us to collect and process information as described below.</p><p>  <strong> What information does the Plum Appliance collect? </strong></p><p>  The Plum Appliance collects:</p><ul>  <li>Information input during setup</li><li>Data from the Plum Appliance sensors</li><li>Your wine history, wine reviews, and followers</li><li>Anonymized consumption information so we can build trend reports</li><li>Purchase information and social information from the Plum web and mobile apps</li><li>Technical information from the device</li></ul></div> <p><p>  <u> Information input during setup: </u> When you install the Plum Appliance, you’ll be asked several questions.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Data from the Plum’s sensors: </u> We collect data on how much argon is left in the canister, how much wine is left in each bottle, and what temperature is in each chamber. By recording this information, the Plum Appliance can offer better features.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Technical information from the device </u>: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with the Plum Appliance, we record your Plum Appliance model and serial number, software version, and technical information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> If a Plum Product interfaces to third party products and services, will information be shared? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Over time, Plum may provide the opportunity for you to interface Plum Products to one or more third party products and services, which will involve the exchange of information from your Plum Product. Your explicit consent and authorization will be required for this interface, and will be revocable by you at any time.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> What additional information does Plum collect and store when a user connects a Plum Product to the Internet? </strong></p><p>  To access your Plum Product over the Internet from a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, you will need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. During setup, the Plum Product will ask for your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the device, along with your IP address, so that you can see Plum Appliance wine data from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with Plum servers and download software updates. Once connected to your Wi-Fi network, your Plum Product regularly uploads to Plum cloud servers the data mentioned above (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to provide you with the service. Additionally, when you create a Plum Account, we collect and store your email address. From that point forward, your email address is used for communications from Plum. Like most Internet sites, we routinely record log entries (including information such as your IP address) and technical information (such as your browser type and version) when your browser, mobile device or Plum Product contacts our servers. These log files are used for troubleshooting and are stored on our cloud servers.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> How does Plum use the information it collects? </strong></p><p>  We use this information to provide and improve Plum Products and services, including information about your wine consumption. We may use your email address to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your Plum use. We use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing your information for any other purpose. We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our cloud servers.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> With whom does Plum share my information? </strong></p><p>  Under no circumstance do we share Personally Identifiable Information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of Plum Products and services without asking you first. We do not rent or sell our customer lists.</p><p>  Our service technicians and other Plum employees have limited access to your information so they can answer your questions if you contact us for help and so they can monitor our servers for technical problems.</p></div> <p><p>  Except as described herein, we will only provide Personally Identifiable Information about our users to a third party if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.</p></p> <p><p>  We may share your aggregated and anonymous information in a variety of ways, including to publish trends about wine consumption, demographics data and other data that would be interesting to the general public. We’ve taken steps to ensure that the information cannot be linked back to you and we require our partners to keep all information in its anonymous form.</p></p> <p><p>  Your personal information may be collected, processed and stored by Plum or its service providers in the United States and other countries where our servers reside. As a result, your personal information may be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions. If you select an outside party for the purchase of your Plum appliance and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. Always check the privacy policies for any company that collects your personal information.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> How long does Plum save my personal information and how can I delete it? </strong></p><p>  Plum stores your Personally Identifiable Information on Plum’s cloud servers for as long as you remain a Plum customer in order to provide you with the service. As described above, some information is stored directly on the Plum appliance. All information is encrypted and cannot easily be accessed.</p><p>  If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@plum.wine" target="_blank"> privacy@plum.wine </a></p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Website Privacy Policy </strong></p><p>  COLLECTION: Wine Plum, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Plum”) collect your information at Plum.wine and its sub-domains (each, a “Site”) in several ways. This information is used to provide users with Plum products and services, to allow us to understand how visitors navigate our Site, and to provide advertising that is relevant to your interests.</p><p>  Purchase and Log-In Information: If you pre-order or purchase Plum products from our Site, we request that you provide your name, email address, billing and shipping address, credit card information and any other information necessary to complete the transaction. If you create a Plum account, your name, billing and shipping address and the last four digits of your credit card information can be stored. We do not collect or store your full credit card information. Our credit card processing service providers, Shopify and Stripe, will collect and store full payment card information from you, even as a guest user, when an order is placed until when it ships. If you create a Plum account and elect to have payment card information saved, Plum will store your payment information.</p></div> <p><p>  Mailing List Information: You may choose to submit your email address via a submission form located on our Site. Your email address may be used to send you news about Plum-related services, products or promotions. We may use one or more service providers to administer these messages, but we do not share your email address with spammers or any other third parties without your permission.</p></p> <p><p>  Appliance Usage information: If you are logged into your Plum account, we record the IP address you visit our website from. We store this data along with your email address, information about your Plum appliance, data collected directly by the appliance, a history of your appliance settings, and any other information we have collected about your use of Plum products and services. See our Privacy Statement to learn more about the usage information collected through our products.</p></p> <div><p>  Website Use Information:</p><p>  <strong> Other Information Collected Automatically. </strong></p><p>  IP and Device Identifiers: The Plum Service automatically collects usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Plum Site and users of the Plum Service. We may also collect device-specific information if you access the Plum Service using a mobile device. Device information may include unique device identifier, media access control address, network information, and hardware model, as well as non-personally identifiable usage and traffic data and information about how the device interacts with the Plum Service. This type of data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Plum Service and learn more about our users’ demographics and Internet behaviors, so that we can analyze, operate and improve our products and services.</p></div> <p><p>  Cookies and Web Beacons: When you visit a Plum Site, we may automatically collect information from your web browser, including your IP address, and may assign your computer one or more cookies to facilitate access to the Plum Site and to analyze and customize your website experience.  This information helps us recognize you, customize your website experience, store items in your cart between visits and make our marketing messages more relevant. Cookies may automatically collect information about your online activity on the Plum Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features we offer. We may also use other standard Internet technologies, such as web beacons, to track your use of a Plum Site. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized and aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these advertising companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies and similar technologies only and does not cover uses by third parties. Please contact these third-party companies (e.g. Google) directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and information collected by the tags and cookies.</p></p> <div><p>  How We Use the Information We Collect</p><p>  In general, we may use information that we collect about you to:</p><ul>  <li>to send you marketing communications about our products and services;</li><li>to provide you with the products and services that you purchase from us;</li><li>to enhance or supplement our services and products for you;</li><li>to communicate with your regarding the status of your products and services and to allow you to communicate with us;</li><li>perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content, or products, services or content offered by others; and</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>perform functions as otherwise described to you in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  With Whom We Share Your Information</p><p>  We do not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent, except as may be necessary to deliver email messages to you, provide analytics and systems analysis for our internal use, process your payment information and/or provide other products and services that you have requested from us, or as further described in this section.</p><p>  Promotions.
