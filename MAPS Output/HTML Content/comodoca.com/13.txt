For these purposes, the legal basis is legitimate interest in the processing of data according to GDPR art. 6(1)(f). </p><p>  The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. Typically, this technical information will be erased or rendered unrecognizable at the latest after seven days. </p></div> <p><p>  The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website.  </p></p> <p><p>  2.2 Each time you use our Service to scan your website, your email address will be processed and definitions of the cookies found when the Service has scanned your website(s), including reports on the result of each scan. </p></p> <div><h3>  IV.

Issued invoices are stored so that you may access any issued invoices from within the Service Manager. </li><li>In case you sign up for either a Cookiebot CMP account or our free GDPR/ePR test, which analyzes your website to give you an indication of whether or not your website is compliant with the rules relating to online tracking set out in the GDPR and ePR, please  note that we evaluate your user behaviour when you register for our service. We record your campaign behaviour. Embedded links contain UTM parameters and other identifiers which will identify all parameters of your “clicks”.The UTM parameters allow us to add trackable extensions to your URLs. The parameters are: </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Medium: this parameter describes the medium in which the link is embedded. Examples: email, social media or website. </li><li>Source: with this UTM parameter we define the source of the link. This can be newsletters, websites, apps or social media channels. </li><li>Campaign: this type of UTM parameter is used to identify the actual campaigns. For example, if we send you a newsletter every month, the individual newsletters can be evaluated separately. </li><li>Term: keywords, so that the link can be identified better. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Content: within a campaign we insert different elements to be tracked in order to identify them clearly and evaluate them separately. Examples: button, image or video. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  The identifiers are generated by the service providers listed in section 12.3 of this privacy policy. We use the identifiers in combination with conversion events, such as account creation (for example, if a trial period starts or you upgrade to a premium account) to inform the service providers about the event in relation to the provided identifiers. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Aggregated statistical data on End User consents. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  3.

ONLINE PRESENCE IN SOCIAL NETWORKS</h3><p>  We maintain online presences in social networks in order to communicate there with customers and interested parties, among others, and to provide information about our products and services. </p><p>  The users’ data is usually processed by the social networks concerned for market research and advertising purposes. In this way, usage profiles can be created based on the interests of the users and on-site behavior, if it exists. For this purpose, cookies and other identifiers are stored on the users’ computers. On the basis of these usage profiles, advertisements, for example, are then placed within the social networks but also on third-party websites. </p></div> <p><p>  As part of the operation of our online presences, it is possible that we can access information such as statistics on the use of our online presences, which are provided by the social networks. These statistics are aggregated and may include, in particular, demographic information and data on interaction with our online presences and the posts and content distributed via them. Please refer to the list below for details and links to the data of the social networks that we can access as operators of the online presences. </p></p> <p><p>  The legal basis for data processing is GDPR art. 6(1)(a)-(b), in order to stay in contact with and inform our customers and to carry out pre-contractual measures with future customers and interested parties. </p></p> <p><p>  For the legal basis of the data processing carried out by the social networks on their own responsibility, please refer to the data protection information of the respective social network. The links below also provide you with further information on the respective data processing and the options to object. </p></p> <p><p>  We would like to point out that data protection requests can be asserted most efficiently with the respective provider of the social network, as only these providers have access to the data and can take appropriate measures directly. Below is a list with information on the social networks on which we operate online presences: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Facebook (USA and Canada: Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA; all other countries: Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland). </li><li>Operation of the Facebook Fanpage in joint responsibility on the basis of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum" target="_blank"> an agreement on joint processing of personal data </a> (so-called Page Insights Supplement regarding the controller). </li><li>Information on the processed Page Insights data and the contact option in the event of data protection enquiries: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data" target="_blank"> https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/information_about_page_insights_data </a> </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Privacy policy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank"> https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ </a> </li><li>Instagram (Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland). </li><li>Privacy policy: <a href="https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875" target="_blank"> https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875 </a>  </li><li>Google/ YouTube (Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland). </li><li>Privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"> https://policies.google.com/privacy </a> </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Twitter (Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07 Ireland). </li><li>Privacy policy: <a href="https://twitter.com/de/privacy" target="_blank"> https://twitter.com/de/privacy </a> </li><li>LinkedIn (LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland). </li><li>Operation of the LinkedIn company page in joint responsibility on the basis of <a href="https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum" target="_blank"> an agreement on joint processing of personal data  </a>(so-called Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum). </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Information on the Page Insights data processed and the contact option in the event of data protection enquiries: <a href="https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum" target="_blank"> https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum </a> </li><li>Privacy policy: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank"> https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy </a> </li><li>Google my business </li><li>We operate a so-called Google My Business entry. Should you find us in this way, we make use of the information service offered by Google and the services of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (hereinafter “Google”). </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>We would like to point out that you use the Google site and its functions on your own responsibility. This applies in particular to the use of the social and interactive functions (e.g. commenting, sharing, rating, direct messaging). When you visit and interact with our Google My Business listing, Google also collects your IP address and other information that is present on your terminal device in the form of so-called cookies. This information is used to provide us, as the operator of the Google My Business listing, with statistical information about the use of Google services. The data collected about you in this context will be processed by Google and may be transferred to countries outside the European Union. Google generally describes what information it receives and how it is used in its privacy policy. Google provides more detailed information in its privacy policy: </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>We do not know how Google uses the data from the visit for its own purposes, to what extent activities of individual users are assigned, how long Google stores this data and whether data is passed on to third parties. When accessing Google services, the IP address assigned to your terminal device is transmitted to Google. Google also stores information about its users’ end devices; this may enable Google to assign IP addresses to individual users or user accounts. </li><li>If you contact us via our Google My Business entry or other Google services by direct message, we cannot rule out the possibility that these messages may also be read and evaluated by Google (both by employees and automatically). We therefore advise against providing us with personal data there. Instead, another form of communication should be chosen as early as possible. We delete conversations no later than 14 days after the last chat activity, or immediately after switching to another communication channel. The use of this service is subject to the Google Privacy Policy, which you – with use – have already agreed to. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>We, as the provider of our Google My Business entry, do not collect or process any further data from your use of this Google service. Beyond that, we do not use any Google functions on our website. </li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  XI. THIRD PARTY LINKS</h3><p>  Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked websites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our website and welcome any feedback about these websites. </p></div> <div><h3>  XII. RECIPIENTS OF DATA AND DATA TRANSFER TO THIRD COUNTRIES</h3><p>  12.1 Recipients of Data </p><p>  Usercentrics does not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties any personally identifiable information.  </p><p>  This does not include trusted third parties or processors who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you. Such trusted parties may have access to personally identifiable information on a need-to-know basis and will be contractually obliged to keep your information confidential. </p></div> <p><p>  We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our rights or the rights of others, property, or safety. Furthermore, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. </p></p> <p><p>  We only pass on the data we have collected if this is necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or for the provision of the technical functionality of the website, or if there is another legal basis for passing on the data. </p></p> <p><p>  In principle, we process your data ourselves. In some cases, however, we also use service providers. In addition to the processors mentioned in this privacy policy, these may include, in particular, data centers that store our website and databases, IT service providers that maintain our systems, and consulting companies. If we pass on data to processors, they may only use the data to fulfill their tasks. The processors have been carefully selected and commissioned by us. They are contractually bound to our instructions, have suitable technical and organizational measures in place to protect the rights of the data subjects and are regularly monitored by us. </p></p> <p><p>  In addition, disclosure may take place in connection with official enquiries, court orders and legal proceedings if it is necessary for legal prosecution or enforcement. When governments make a lawful demand for customer data from Usercentrics, Usercentrics strives to limit the disclosure. Usercentrics will only release specific data mandated by the relevant legal demand. </p></p> <p><p>  If compelled to disclose your data, Usercentrics will promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so. </p></p> <p><p>  If Usercentrics commissions third parties with the collection, processing and use of data within the scope of commissioned processing in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR, this will also take place exclusively in compliance with the statutory provisions on data protection. </p></p> <p><p>  12.2 Data Transfer to third Countries </p></p> <p><p>  As explained in this privacy policy, we use services whose providers are partly located in so-called third countries (outside the European Union or the European Economic Area) or process personal data there, i.e. countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to that of the European Union. Where this is the case and the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR) for these countries, we have taken appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses of the European Union or binding internal data protection regulations. </p></p> <p><p>  If a third country transfer is provided for and no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards are in place, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. intelligence services) may gain access to the transferred data in order to collect and analyze it, and that enforceability of your data subject rights cannot be guaranteed. </p></p> <p><p>  12.3 Processors /Trusted Third Parties</p></p> <td><td>
