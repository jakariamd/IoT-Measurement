All other terms, unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Notice, shall have the definitions assigned to them in the Privacy Policy. </p></p> <p><p>  As of January 1, 2023, the CPRA expands the CCPA so that it provides the same data privacy rights that it provides to consumers to employees and job applicants, or other similarly situated individuals.</p></p> <p><p>  Where noted in this Privacy Notice, the CCPA/CPRA temporarily exempts personal information reflecting a written or verbal business-to-business communication (“<u> B2B personal information </u>”) from some its requirements.</p></p> <div><h1>  <strong> INFORMATION WE COLLECT </strong></h1><p>  We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular employee, job applicant, consumer, household, or device (“<u> personal information </u>”). The CPRA adds a second category of personal information, referred to as sensitive personal information (“<strong> sensitive personal information </strong>”). Sensitive personal information is personal information that reveals: (i) a consumer’s social security, driver’s license, state identification card, or passport number; (ii) a consumer’s account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account; (iii) a consumer’s precise geolocation; (iv) a consumer’s racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership; (v) the contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages unless the business is the intended recipient of the communication; (vi) a consumer’s genetic data; (vii) the processing of biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer; (viii) personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health; or (iix) personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s sex life or sexual orientation. Neither Personal information nor Sensitive Personal Information includes:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Publicly available information from government records.</li><li>Deidentified or aggregated consumer information.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In particular, we have collected the following categories of personal information from consumers, employees, job applicants, and contractors within the last twelve (12) months:</p></p> <div><td>  <strong> Category </strong></td><td>  <strong> Examples </strong></td><td>  <strong> Possibly Collected </strong></td><td>  <strong> Consumer </strong></td><td>  <strong> Employee/ </strong>
