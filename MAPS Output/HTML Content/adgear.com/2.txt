The AdGear cookie is unique to the consumer’s browser. The cookie does not contain the consumer’s name, address, phone number, email address, or other information that directly identifies the consumer. When dropping non-essential cookies, AdGear relies on consumer consent collected and supplied to us by the operator of the website that uses our technology. </p></div> <p><p>  For more information about the cookies we use and how to exercise your choices, please see our </p></p> <div><span>  Cookie Policy</span></div> <div><h3>  AdGear’s Cross-Device Technology </h3><p>  On an average day, an individual Internet-connected consumer might use multiple browsers and various devices, including desktop or laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, and Smart TVs. As a result, a single consumer may have multiple behavioral, interest-based, preference-based, or demographic profiles fragmented among several browsers and devices. AdGear uses its proprietary cross-device technology to link these profiles, devices, or sets of devices, based on common attributes, behaviors, or consumer preferences. On behalf of our clients, we may use these groupings (consumer segments) to target advertising campaigns.</p></div> <p><p>  Our cross-device technology uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods to establish connections between related devices. The deterministic method relies on immutable information, such as device identifiers or hashed login information. The probabilistic method uses non-fixed information from devices and browsers, including IP address and browser information, which may change over time and could be shared by multiple individual consumers. Using these methods of analysis, our cross-device technology is able to infer whether devices are likely to belong to the same consumer or to different consumers within a common household.</p></p> <div><h3>  Information Sharing with Third Parties</h3><p>  AdGear may receive from or share personal information with third parties under the following circumstances:</p><ul>  <li>Information voluntarily provided by the ad campaign recipients, by way of embedded forms or fields within the ad creative, may be collected, and shared with the client on whose behalf the campaign is served, at the client’s specific request. This information is used solely by AdGear’s client to fulfill the purposes specified within the advertisement, such as to provide the consumer with requested goods, services, or information. At no time do we distribute this information to any party other than as indicated in the ad.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>AdGear may enable certain third parties to collect information for the purposes of protecting the safety and security of AdGear’s platform and online ecosystem, including to detect and prevent malicious activity or fraudulent traffic. These third parties may include advertising exchanges, data management platforms and marketplaces, geo location data providers and </li></ul></ul> <div><span>  advertisement </span><span>  viewability measurement technology providers. We may disclose such information in the event we reasonably suspect malicious activity or fraudulent traffic or when it is required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. </span><ul>  <li>Subject to applicable privacy law, AdGear may share certain personal information with one or more AdGear affiliates or subsidiaries, such as our parent company, Samsung Electronics Canada Inc.</li><li>We share certain personal information with our service providers</li></ul></div> <span><span>  , such as our data hosting providers.</span></span> <span><span>  Our data storage vendors may store the data they receive on servers that are located in the US.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>We share certain personal information about consumers with third parties who provide us with information to enable targeted advertising on website(s) and application(s) that use our technology. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition, we may share personal information we collect at your request.  AdGear, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our third-party service providers also may disclose information about you (1) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena); (2) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (3) to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights; (4) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical or other harm or financial loss; (5) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; (6) in the event of a potential or actual sale or transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, acquisition, joint venture, reorganization, divestiture, dissolution or liquidation); or (7) otherwise with your consent.</p></p> <div><h3>  Location of Processing</h3><p>  AdGear’s technology and services are controlled from Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
