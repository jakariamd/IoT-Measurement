The package name, app license and DAP placement ID (pid) must be the same as those registered on DAP.</p><p>  B. The network condition is good enough for testing.</p><p>  C. Your app/placement status on DAP is ‘Publishing’.</p><p>  D. The test device in China must be connected to a VPN.</p><p>  It is not mandatory to have a Facebook placement ID. Without a Facebook ID, you can only apply for a DAP placement ID for monetization. With a Facebook placement ID, DAP can help developers to dynamically rank multiple ad channels with our “peak selection algorithm” to maximum monetization revenue.</p></div> <p><p>  Please make sure your test device has a VPN connected and make sure the Facebook app has been installed and is logged in on your test device.</p></p> <p><p>  After you paused your DAP placement, the ad source from DU will be closed. If you fill in a Facebook placement ID in the DU SDK, you can still receive ads from Facebook. The Facebook placement can be closed on <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/" target="_blank"> https://developers.facebook.com/ </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  By primarily using the ad monetization model, the DU Ad Platform strives to provide benefits to both developers and users.
