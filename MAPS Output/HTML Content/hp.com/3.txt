For example, Automatic Data Collection Tools may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We use third party tools to track website usage and activity.The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics.

When you next visit our websites, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the website features that you previously chose. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link Automatic Data Collection Tools together so you will still receive a personalized online experience. We can also personalize the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things.

Social Media Tools: If you are a registered user, the information collected from our websites is not anonymous and we may use this information along with other information we know or infer about you including your preferences to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you.These tools are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on HP websites sites or apps, or when you engage with our content on or through a social site such as Facebook or Twitter.
