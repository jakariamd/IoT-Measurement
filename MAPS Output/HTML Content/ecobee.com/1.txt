Specifically, ecobee collects Personal Information and Device data as follows:</p></p> <p><p>  Every computer connected to the Internet is provided with a domain name (e.g. someispname.net) and an IP Address (e.g. 192.164.13.145). When a visitor requests a page from the ecobee website, our Web Servers automatically identify and log the HTTP request that is made to our Web Server. By itself, this information reveals nothing personal about you. In fact, the only information that we automatically gather and log is as follows:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The IP Address of the Site that may have Referred you</li><li>Your IP Address</li><li>The Web Page that you may have linked to us from, if any</li><li>The Product Identifier for Version and Make of Browser (e.g. Internet Explorer®)</li><li>The Operating System platform that you may be running (e.g. Macintosh® or Windows®)</li><li>Search Words or Terms that are passed from a Search Engine (e.g. Google® or Yahoo!®)</li><li>Information readily available and stored in your Adobe® Flash ‘System.Capabilities’ Object.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  There is absolutely nothing special about the information just described, and the practice of collecting this data has been generally standardized by virtually every Web Server on the Internet today.</p></p> <p><p>  The purpose for this information is actually two-fold. One, ecobee has found it advantageous to examine visitor traffic in its aggregate, so that we can ensure maximum compatibility for the various Browsers and Operating Systems that visit our site. Additionally, as any business should attest, it is our desire to generate greater amounts of visitor traffic.

E-Mail Address
Phone Number
Credit Card Number (for Credit Card Orders)
Expiration Date (for Credit Card Orders)
CCV2 Code (for Credit Card Orders)</p><p>  This information will be shared with our online shopping cart provider and payment processor. We use shopping cart features that safeguard this information by using industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypted servers. SSL encodes the information transferred between you and the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the information. Your credit card data (which is never seen or recorded by ecobee) will be deleted by the cart provider and payment processor in 30 days.</p></div> <p><p>  If you purchase your Device as part of an utility-sponsored electricity usage or Demand Response program (“Utility Program”), your name, address, contact details and other information relating to your purchase may be forwarded to your utility provider or its third party designate (collectively, “program implementers”) in order verify your eligibility in the Utility Program, installation details and for any potential rebates or other participation rewards.</p></p> <p><p>  If you select an installation option as part of your purchase (available in certain areas only), your name, address and contact details may be forwarded to ecobee’s installation partner to facilitate the installation of your purchased Device(s).</p></p> <p><p>  If you register your Device (e.g., an ecobee smart thermostat, SmartCamera or Switch+) on ecobee.com or the ecobee Mobile app, and create an ecobee account, you will be required to provide an e-mail address to associate with your ecobee account (“ecobee Account Data”). When you have registered your Device and created an ecobee account, you will be able to remotely view and control your Device from anywhere on the internet via a mobile application or our web portal.</p></p> <p><p>  Your ecobee Device will collect environmental data such as temperature and humidity as well as operational data such as temperature set points from your HVAC equipment. Some Device models may include additional types of data such motion sensing (i.e., “occupancy sensing”). Depending on your Device model, your Device may also collect data from remote sensors in addition to the Device itself. Using machine learning with both on-device and remote processing, environmental, operational HVAC and occupancy sensing data and is used to optimize the heating and cooling algorithms on your Device to minimize energy usage when you are home or away. Collectively, this is known as Device Data. For ecobee Smart Security users, occupancy-sensing data can be used to arm or disarm your home monitoring solution.</p></p> <p><p>  To enable these remote functions, your Device needs to transmit Device Data to the web portal. These transmissions are fully encrypted. The Device Data will be stored by the web portal to provide you with historical reports. When you install your ecobee Device, you’ll be asked for Personal Information like your name, home address, postal/ZIP code as well home details (like house age, number of floors, etc.), which is considered ecobee Account Data. We use both Device Data and ecobee Account Data to make more intelligent decisions about how to manage your heating and cooling, and to reduce your energy bills. We may also anonymously aggregate your Device Data with Device Data from other homes in order to create reports, benchmarks and allow you (and others) to compare energy usage, on an anonymous basis, with similar homes. ecobee may also send you information and reports regarding your Device’s operations, software updates, energy-savings opportunities or promotions directly onscreen in the web portal, or via email.</p></p> <p><p>  You can delete your ecobee account and associated ecobee Account Data, as well as Device Data by deregistering your Device(s) using the web portal or directly on the Device.</p></p> <p><p>  By providing your email address you agree to receive digital and electronic communications from ecobee.

These electronic communications may be sent through email, the ecobee mobile app, the ecobee web portal or other communication channels as deemed relevant by ecobee.</p></p> <p><p>  You can disable emailed HVAC alerts and reminders using the ecobee web portal or mobile app and can opt out of receiving email communications via the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of every email. ecobee will not give your email address to a third-party without your consent.</p></p> <p><p>  If you register for one of our mailing lists or online communities, we may use your e-mail address to send you updates such as announcements, news and new products or services. You have the option of ‘Unsubscribing’ at any time, thereby disabling any further such e-mail communication from being sent to you.</p></p> <p><p>  If you wish to have specific communications with a member of the ecobee staff from one of our social communities, you will be required to provide specific information that will be routed to the appropriate contact within ecobee, and agree to have ecobee staff responds to your communication.</p></p> <p><p>  eco+ works by monitoring your energy use, the usage rate structure of your utility provider and any Demand Response programs and Demand Response events that your Utility or its third party partners and implementors of such programs may issue (individually or collectively, “Utility”). In order to operate and make eco+ available, ecobee collects, and may disclose, certain information from you with and from your Utility. ecobee Account Data and Device Data collected or shared by ecobee with your Utility (including its program implementors) or, to the extent required by law, the relevant Regulatory body, may include: your Name, your Address, Housing characteristics, your utility account number (if provided by you), your thermostat serial number, your thermostat data and your HVAC usage data. Personal Information collected or shared by your Utility with ecobee may include: your Name, your Address, your Utility account number, Utility account information, your utility meter ID, and utility meter data (collectively, “shared data”). Subject to any applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory decisions or policies, shared data may be used for the purposes of assessing your eligibility to participate in Utility Programs, verification of your participation in Utility Programs, making intelligent decisions relating to energy production and conservation, providing Demand Response and Energy Measurement and verification services to a Utility or its governing regulatory body. ecobee may also use the shared data to improve its services, including eco+.</p></p> <p><p>  If you agree to participate in an ecobee eco+ or utility-sponsored electricity management, usage or Demand Response program (“Utility Program”), ecobee, your Utility as well as any utility system operators (collectively, “program implementers”) may share account information to the extent necessary to validate your eligibility and participation in the Utility Program. In order to implement the Utility program, the program implementors may need to associate your accounts held between the different program partners.</p></p> <p><p>  The program implementors may also use your ecobee Account Data, Device Data and electricity use in order to make intelligent decisions relating to electricity production and conservation, and to provide Demand Response and Energy Measurement and Verification reports and services. Data contained in these EM&V reports and services may be shared with the appropriate utility system implementors and regulators as part of the Utility Program. ecobee may also use this data to improve its services, including the Utility Program. The program implementer(s) may also anonymously aggregate your data with data from other homes in order to create reports, benchmarks and allow you (and others) to compare energy usage, on an anonymous basis, with similar homes.</p></p> <p><p>  Your Utility and program implementer will not sell, rent, or otherwise give your ecobee Account Data or Device Data to a third-party for purposes unrelated to the Utility Program, without your consent.</p></p> <p><p>  The contractor that installs your Device may link their business contact information with your Device. This information, if entered, will appear with the Alerts and Reminders that are generated by the Device and can be found in the Settings-> About function on the Device or in the Settings-> About panel in your ecobee web portal. From time to time, the contractor may send maintenance reminders and/or promotional offers that will appear in the web portal. This contractor-provided information will not appear directly on the Device screen or be sent to you by e-mail without your consent. The contractor will use this web portal information to service their accounts and will agree to a strict ‘No Spam, or UCE’ policy.</p></p> <p><p>  ecobee provides technicians who install the ecobee Device with a contractor web portal. This contractor web portal allows the technicians to track and maintain the Devices that they have installed and may contain the following information: Device ID number, the status of the Device (online/offline), and certain ecobee Account Data, such as customer’s name, address, phone number and/or e-mail. The technician may also be able to view service notes relating to previous service calls, and the time of the next scheduled service call or service reminder. If your ecobee Device is a communicating Device, it may also forward operational and diagnostics information from compatible HVAC equipment (furnace, air conditioner, etc.) to the contractor web portal, if the communicating functionality is enabled. You can remove yourself from your technicians list of Devices by using the Settings->About panel in the ecobee web portal.</p></p> <p><p>  ecobee Devices are capable of communicating and integrating with a growing number of third party devices, applications and services such as Apple HomeKit and IFTTT.

For more information, see ecobee.com/donateyourdata.</p></p> <p><p>  Certain ecobee Devices are Alexa Enabled Products, meaning they are capable of being voice-controlled using the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) provided by Amazon Digital Services LLC (“Amazon”). When AVS is enabled on your ecobee Device, your Device continuously listens for “wake words”. When the ecobee Device hears one of these wake words, it will initiate a brief audio recording and transmit that recorded message to Amazon for voice recognition processing. Use of AVS and third party services via AVS are governed by the Alexa Terms of Use (as provided on the Amazon.com website). Any information you provide to Amazon will be treated in accordance with the Amazon Privacy Notice (also available on the Amazon.com website), not the ecobee Privacy Policy. ecobee does not have direct access to, or retain any copies of, your recorded voice messages to AVS. When your Alexa-enabled ecobee Device is in Private mode, it is not listening for wake words, and no recorded messages are sent to Amazon.</p></p> <p><p>  ecobee SmartCameras can stream and store recorded audio and video in the cloud. No one can see your video without your permission or a court order. Video is processed directly on your SmartCamera and recordings and snapshots are stored securely on the cloud for 14 days. All recordings and snapshots that are saved to the cloud are visible in the ecobee mobile app, so you know exactly what clips have been sent and saved. When you delete a video from the ecobee app it will also erase that video from the cloud. For ecobee Smart Security customers, your SmartCamera can also be used to help determine occupancy and when to enable or disable your home monitoring system.</p></p> <div><p>  ecobee will only disclose your Personal Information or any of its log file information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such actions are necessary to:</p><ul>  <li>With your explicit consent: We may share Personal Information such as e-mail addresses when authorized by you.
