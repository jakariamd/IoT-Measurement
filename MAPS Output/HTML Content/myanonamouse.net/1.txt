You must follow the usual minimum Seeding rules on FREELEECH downloads too i.e a total of 72 hours within 30 days </b></label></div> <div><label>  Why do my downloads sometimes slow down/stall when they are nearly complete?</label><label>  How can I improve my download speed?</label><p>  <u>  - Do not immediately jump on new torrents  </u>
The download speed mostly depends on the seeder-to-leecher ratio (SLR). Poor download speed is mainly a problem with new and very popular torrents where the SLR is low. (Make sure you remember that you did not enjoy the low speed. Seed so that others will not endure the same!) 
<u> - Limit your upload speed  </u>
The upload speed affects the download speed in essentially two ways:
 •Bittorrent peers tend to favour those other peers that upload to them. This means that if A and B are leeching the same torrent and A is sending data to B at high speed then B will try to reciprocate. So due, to this effect, high upload speeds can  lead to high download speeds.
•Due to the way TCP works, when A is downloading something from B it has to keep telling B that it received the data sent to him. (These are called acknowledgements - ACKs - a sort of "got it!" message). If A fails to do this then B will stop sending data and wait. If A is uploading at full speed there may be no bandwidth left for the ACKs and they will be delayed. So due to this effect excessively high upload speeds lead to low download speeds.
 The full effect is a combination of the two. The upload should be kept as high as possible while allowing the ACKs to get through without delay. A good rule of thumb is keeping the upload at about 80% of the theoretical upload speed but you will have to fine tune yours to find out what works best for you. (Remember that keeping the upload high has the additional benefit of improving your ratio.) 
If you are running more than one instance of a client it is the overall upload speed that you must take into account. Some clients (e.g. Azureus) limit global upload speed, others do it on a per torrent basis. Get to know  how your client works. The same applies if you are using your connection for anything else (e.g. browsing or ftp), always think of the impact on  your overall upload speed.
<u>  - Limit the number of simultaneous connections>  </u> 
Some operating systems do not deal well with a large number of connections, and may even crash. Also some home routers (particularly when running NAT and/or firewall with stateful inspection services) tend to become slow or crash when having to deal with too many connections. There are no fixed values for this, you may try 60 or 100 and experiment with the value. Note that these numbers are additive, if you have two instances of a client running the numbers add up.
<u>  - Limit the number of simultaneous uploads  </u> 
Isn't this the same as above? No! Connections limit the number of peers your client is talking to and/or downloading from. Uploads limit the number of peers your client is actually uploading to. The ideal number is typically much lower than the number of connections, and highly dependent on your (physical) connection.
<u> - Just give it some time    </u>
As explained above, peers favour other peers that upload to them. When you start leeching a new torrent you have nothing to offer to other peers and they will tend to ignore you. This makes the starts slow; in particular if the peers you are connected to include few or no seeders. The download speed should increase as soon as you have some pieces to share.</p></div> <label><label>  Why is my browsing so slow while leeching?<b> NetLimiter. </b></label></label> <div><h1>  UPLOADING</h1><label>  Why can't I upload torrents?<b> Uploaders </b></label><label>  What criteria must I meet before I can join the <font> Uploading </font> team?</label><p>  You need to fill out the <a href="/tor/requestUpload.php" target="_blank"> short questionnaire </a> to get your upload ability enabled.</p><label>  Can I upload your torrents to other trackers?<b> No. </b></label><label>  Can I upload any author?<b> RULES </b></label><label>  How do I know what piece size to use on creation?</label></div> <div><td>  32 KiB</td><td>  1 Byte through 69 MiB</td><td>  1 Byte through 156.25 MiB</td><td>  64 KiB</td><td>  62.5 MiB through 137.5 MiB</td><td>  1 Byte through 312.5 MiB</td><td>  128 KiB</td><td>  125 MiB through 275 MiB</td><td>  62.5 MiB through 625 MiB</td><td>  256 KiB</td><td>  250 MiB through 550 MiB</td><td>  125 MiB through 1250 MiB / 1.22 GiB</td><td>  512 KiB</td><td>  500 MiB through 1100 MiB / 1.07 GiB</td><td>  250 MiB through 2500 MiB / 2.44 GiB</td><td>  1024 KiB / 1 MiB</td><td>  1000 MiB through 2200 MiB / 2.15 GiB</td></div> <td><td>  500 MiB through 4.88 GiB</td></td> <div><td>  2048 KiB / 2 MiB</td><td>  1.95 GiB through 4.30 GiB</td><td>  1000 MiB through 9.76 GiB</td><td>  4096 KiB / 4 MiB Generally highest you will need</td><td>  3.9 GiB through 8.59 GiB</td><td>  1.95 GiB through 20 GiB (site max)</td><td>  8192 KiB / 8 MiB Use with caution</td><td>  7.81 GiB through 17.19 GiB</td><td>  3.9 GiB through 20 GiB (site max)</td></div> <div><h1>  USEFUL INFORMATION</h1><label>  SEEDBOXES  - What is a seedbox?</label><p>  The function of a Seedbox is really just as it sounds:  a server box that is rented each month to download and <i> seed </i> torrent files. It is located on a private dedicated server which is connected to a very fast network. Seedboxes are generally used for the uploading and downloading of digital files generally making use of the BitTorrent protocol though they can also be used on other file sharing websites. They can run on most major operating systems (Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X).

Note:  The use of seedboxes with dynamic ip address are not allowed at myanonamouse.  Most have options for static ips what you MUST USE if you wish them to work with us.</p></div> <div><label>  SEEDBOXES - What are the advantages of a seedbox?</label><p>  <em> Speed:  </em> They are a very fast! Seedboxes on high speed networks are typically able to download large files within minutes, provided that the swarm can actually handle such a high upload bandwidth. Seedboxes generally have download and upload speeds of 100 megabits per second. This means that a 1 GB file can finish downloading in less than 2 minutes. That same 1 gigabyte file can be uploaded to other users in the same amount of time thus very rapidly creating a 1:1 upload:download ratio for that individual file. The ability of a seedbox to transfer files so quickly makes it very  attractive within the P2P and BitTorrent communities. 
<em>  Seeding:  </em> since Seedboxes never stop working, after you have downloaded your file on your Seedbox and have transferred it to your computer via sFTP, you can forget about your file and leave it seeding on your box. It will continue to upload for as long as you keep it there. 
<em>  Ratio Maintaince:  </em> Private trackers like MyAnonamouse often require that, overall,  you seed as much as you download (a 1:1 ratio) so Seedboxes can be very useful in private communities like ours. Without a Seedbox, it can often take a long time on a home computer just to meet/maintain your ratio, where on a Seedbox it might only take a few hours...... 
<em>  Anonymity:  </em>  It is less easy to trace file sharers using a seedbox </p></div> <div><label>  SEEDBOXES  -  And the disadvantages?</label><p>  <em>  Cost:  </em>  As mentioned above, they are usually rented on a monthly basis and vary in cost depending on the type and size. </p><label>  <b> IP ADDRESSES (Internet Protocol Address) </b></label><p>  <b> Internet Protocol Address: </b>This number is an exclusive numerical label which is used by all Information Technology devices (routers, modems etc) in order to be individually identified. As such it allows them the ability to communicate with each other on a computer network using a standard of communication which is called an <u> Internet Protocol standard. </u> In layman’s terms it is the same principle as your home address. In order for you to receive post to your home, the sending party must have your correct postal address <b> ( = IP address) </b> in your location <b> ( = network) </b> or you do not receive any letters and parcels. The same is true for all equipment on the internet. Without this specific address, information (in the case of MyAnonaMouse, torrents, invitation emails, PM’s etc) simply cannot be received or sent by you. 
<b> Domain Name System (DNS): </b> This allows the IP address to be translated to words. It is much easier for us to remember a word than a series of numbers. The same is true for email addresses.
For example, it is much easier for you to remember a web address name such as <u> whatismyip.com </u> than it is to remember the same thing in number format such as <u> 192.168.1.1. </u> Similarly,  in the case of email it is much easier to remember <u> someone@somedomain.com </u> than <u> email@192.168.1.1 </u>........

IP addresses may either be assigned <b> permanently </b> for an Email server/Business server or a permanent home resident or <b> temporarily </b>, from a pool of available addresses (first come first serve) from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
<b> Dynamic IP Address: </b> One that is not static and could change at any time. This type is issued to you from a pool of addresses allocated by your ISP or DHCP Server. This is for a large number of customers that do not require the same address all the time for a variety of reasons. Your computer will automatically get this number as it logs on to the network and saves you the trouble of having to know details regarding the specific network configurations. This number can be assigned to anyone using a dial-up connection, Wireless and High Speed Internet connections. If you need to run your own email server or web server, it would be best to have a static IP address.
<b> Static IP Address: </b> One that is fixed and never changes. This is in contrast to a dynamic IP address which may change at any time. (Most ISP's can offer to assign a single static IP or a block of static IP's).
<b> Ipv4: </b> The designers of the Internet Protocol defined an IP address as a 32-bit number[1] and this system, known as Internet Protocol Version4 (IPv4), is still in use today. However, with more and more computers accessing the internet, IPv4 IPs are running out quickly. Just like in an expanding city or country, addresses and telephone numbers have to be created for new neighbourhoods but, if your neighbourhood gets too large, eventually an entirely new pool of addresses for communication purposes has to be developed. IPv4 is limited to 4,294,967,296 IPs.
<b> IPv6: </b> The replacement for the aging IPv4....... IPv6 was standardized in 1998 and its deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000.  The estimated number of unique IPs for IPv6 is 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 or 2^128.


The old and current standard of IPs was something like this: 192.168.100.100 (which is what most of you will have on your Personal Details page).  The new IP address process can be written in different ways (e.g. for IPv6 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1) but essentially all serve  the same process and hence are valid for the range of IP functions. 
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) manages the IP address space allocations globally and delegates five regional Internet registries (RIRs) to allocate IP address blocks to local Internet registries -  namely, Internet service providers and other entities. </p></div> <div><label>  WHAT IS CONNECTABILITY?</label><p>  Connectability relates to the state of “being connectable”. Being connectable means that an incoming port on your computer is open thereby allowing “other peers in the Bit Torrent swarm to be able to make connections to you” (that is to say, “people  in the same torrent as you can contact you in order to share data.”)
 A connectable user can share data with anyone in the torrent but two unconnectable people <i> can't </i> establish a connection between them........so if you're <u> not </u> connectable, it means that you can't seed to, or leech from, anyone else who isn't connectable. Obviously this can greatly affect your contribution to the Myanonamouse community and as well as being critical to your ratio..........
 Being unconnectable also negatively affects the speed of the “swarm”. Each peer who is unconnectable is restricted to sharing data only with peers who are connectable. If most of the peers in a swarm are connectable the result is relatively unnoticeable; however, the greater the percentage of unconnectable peers, the slower the swarm becomes until it dies at the point where all peers are unconnectable. (After all, at that point there's no one left to connect to!) So being connectable is critically important for good download speeds and the general well being of the "swarm"…….as well as for your personal ratio.
When thinking about your Connectability, remember our motto </p></div> <span><span>  "Friendliness, Warmth and <b> SHARING"!!! </b></span></span> <div><h1>  <b>    TECHNICAL ISSUES </b></h1><label>  ERROR MESSAGES:  - I keep getting “HTTP 500 Internal Server Error” when trying to log in</label><label>  ERROR MESSAGES: Why do I get a "rejected by tracker - Port xxxx is blacklisted" error?</label><td>  Kazaa</td><td>  1214</td><td>  eDonkey</td><td>  4662</td><td>  Gnutella</td><td>  6346 - 6347</td><td>  BitTorrent</td><td>  6881 - 6889</td><td>  Priviliged ports</td><td>  1024 & Below<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers" target="_blank"> IANA </a><i> increase </i></td></div> <label><label>  INTERNET PROTOCOL (I.P.)
