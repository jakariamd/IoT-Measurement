Statement”) describes the types of personal data we collect when you access our
websites and browser-based portals that link to this Privacy Statement (the "Websites"),
our practices for collecting, using, and sharing such personal data, and your rights with
respect to such personal data. <strong> We strongly encourage you to read this Privacy
Statement in its entirety. </strong></p></div> <p><p>  Please note that this Privacy Statement does <u> not </u> apply to personal data collected by
Entrust via Entrust’s other business products and services, in which case Entrust typically
acts as a service provider to our business clients (please see the section below titled
“Entrust as a Service Provider” for additional information), and does not apply to personal
data collected by Entrust (i) via Entrust’s mobile applications, (ii) in its role as an employer
or prospective employer, or (iii) through other means, e.g., information we collect when
you interact with us at industry conferences or via phone or email, or information we
collect from third parties, which, in each case, Entrust’s data collection and processing
practices are governed by separate privacy statements.</p></p> <p><p>  By continuing to use the Websites, you have accepted this Privacy Statement in its
entirety and without modification and agreed to our collection, use, and sharing of your
personal data, as described in this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree with this
Privacy Statement, please do not use the Websites.</p></p> <p><p>  We may revise this Privacy Statement periodically and will post any changes to the
Websites. Changes to this Privacy Statement are effective at the time they are posted,
and your continued use of the Websites after posting will constitute acceptance of, and
agreement to be subject to, those changes. Please review this Privacy Statement from
time to time to ensure you are aware of changes to this Privacy Statement.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Entrust as a Service Provider </strong>. In providing services to our business clients Entrust acts
as a service provider (also known as a “data processor”). Our clients – many of which

Entrust client, then any information collected in connection with such use will be
processed and shared in accordance with that client’s privacy policies and practices and,
to the extent applicable, our product-specific privacy notices in our capacity as such
client’s service provider. If you have questions about the processing of your personal
data by an Entrust client using an Entrust product or service, please contact that client
directly. </p></p> <div><h2>

that serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads
may be personalized, meaning they are intended to be relevant to you based on
information Advertising Providers collect about your use of our Websites and other
websites or apps over time, often through the use of cookies or similar technologies,
including information about relationships among different browsers and devices. This
type of advertising is known as targeted advertising (also referred to as “cross-context
behavioral advertising”).</p></div> <p><p>  We may also work with third parties that collect data using cookies and similar
technologies about your use of our Websites and other sites or apps over time for nonadvertising purposes. Entrust uses Google Analytics and other third-party services to

it earlier or to keep it longer. We also retain personal data as necessary to comply with

access certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password
confidential. You should not share your password with anyone.</p></div> <p><p>  Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
