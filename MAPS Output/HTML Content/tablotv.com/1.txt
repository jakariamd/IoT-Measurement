<div><h1>  Tablo Privacy Policy</h1><p>  <strong> About Recent Updates to Our Privacy Policy </strong>We have recently made changes to the privacy policy regarding the data your Tablo DVR collects and shares with Nuvyyo Inc. (the parent company of Tablo) and our partners. You can review the full policy below.</p><p>  While we may share data with trusted partners for operational reasons, we still do not and will not sell your information to third-party data brokers.</p><p>  In general, data is viewed in aggregate and used to monitor interactions of Tablo DVRs with apps and infrastructure at Tablo HQ and to make overall business decisions.</p></div> <p><p>  The exception is information accessed by our support team on your behalf to assist you with troubleshooting and subscription account inquiries or to improve your experience with our apps or our websites.You can enable or disable the sharing of viewing data with us within the <a href="https://support.tablotv.com/hc/en-us/articles/9447867875604" target="_blank"> SETTINGS screen of most Tablo apps under ABOUT> VIEWING DATA </a>. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Overview </strong>We have offices in the United States and Canada and the management of our brands is located largely at our headquarters in Kanata, Ontario, Canada.</p></p> <p><p>  By visiting and using our products and services the personal data you share with us or that we collect automatically will be collected, stored, processed, or transferred in and to the United States and Canada where our technical infrastructure is located and operated. Some of our partners and service providers may have operations in other countries as well.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> What This Policy Covers </strong>This privacy policy applies to our general collection and use of personal data and specifically to any of our publicly available devices, websites or digital applications (“apps”) that link to this policy. This policy also applies to any of our non-public systems used by partners, job applicants, and employees.</p></p> <p><p>  We also specifically address Tracking Technology used for Advertising, Data Sharing, and Data Transfers.</p></p> <p><p>  All references in this policy to “Nuvyyo” “Tablo”, "our", "us" or "we" refer to Nuvyyo, Inc. or one of our brands, subsidiaries, or affiliates.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> What Is Personal Data? </strong> Generally, the terms personal data or personally identifiable information mean information that relates to an identifiable person. In some cases, the terms may include information that identifies a household. An identifiable person is an individual who can be singled out by using information such as their name, address, or telephone number. For example, Ms. Cindy Delgado who lives at 123 Anywhere Street with a telephone number of 513-513-5133 is an identifiable person. Cindy’s name, address, telephone number, and even her choice of pronoun are examples of her personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> What's Not Covered in This Policy? </strong>Products and services provided by any other company are not covered by this policy. In some instances, we provide links, advertisements, or products and services offered by other companies. You may also view our content via services provided by other companies. Companies providing those products or services will have their own terms and policies and any information they collect will follow their rules and not ours. Make sure to check their privacy policy to learn how they will use your information.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Quick Links </strong>This privacy policy describes the following important topics relating to your information:</p><p>  <strong> What Personal Data We Collect and How We Collect It </strong> [<a href="#top" target="_blank"> Back to Top </a>]The personal data we collect can be divided into three categories:</p><ul>  <li>Personal data you give us directly.</li><li>Personal data we collect automatically through our products or services.</li><li>Personal data we obtain from other sources.</li></ul></div> <div><p>  Personal data you give us directly may include your:</p><ul>  <li>Full name.</li><li>Preferred pronoun.</li><li>Job title.</li><li>Email address.</li><li>Telephone number.</li><li>Contact or mailing address.</li><li>Preferences, likes, bookmarks, ratings, and feedback.</li><li>Resume or CV.</li><li>Banking or payment details.</li><li>Information generally applicable to employment.</li><li>Image.</li><li>Health information.</li></ul><p>  You have the opportunity and choice to provide us this personal data at various times and for various reasons including:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Using the online forms provided on our websites and apps to create an account, request help, provide feedback, take a survey, enter a contest, or apply for a job.</li><li>Registering for or attending in-person or online events hosted by us.</li><li>Contacting us by phone, post, or email.</li><li>Interacting with us on platforms and technologies through which we communicate, such as messaging apps, helpdesk tools, work collaboration tools, financial management tools, vendor portals, and human resource management tools.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If you are a supplier or partner, you may give us personal data when you are offering or providing services to us.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  Personal data we collect automatically may include:</p><ul>  <li>Information about your device(s).</li><li>Information about the app you are using.</li><li>Information about your Internet browser.</li><li>Your IP address.</li><li>Other online identifiers.</li><li>Location information based on your IP address.</li><li>Usage behavior and history.</li><li>Your image where captured on CCTV at any of our premises.</li><li>Time spent at our premises.</li></ul><p>  Some of the technical data listed above is collected when you interact with us online.

We enable third parties such as advertising partners and analysis firms to collect information through tracking technology. The information collected through this tracking technology may be considered personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  Where we use tracking technology, you may block the technology or opt out of certain advertisements. To do so, you can activate the setting on your device that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some tracking technology; we have provided some helpful links below for various devices and operating systems. Additionally, we offer Technology Settings that allow you to control your experience on the web, our apps. and devices. Please be aware, if you use your device settings to block all tracking technology, you may not be able to access all or parts of our websites or apps or use all the available functionality.  The website <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank"> www.aboutads.info </a> provides another option to opt-out of advertisements. It is important to note, the opt-out tool applies only to the device and browser you are using to opt out. Therefore, if you use a different device, change web browsers or clear or change settings, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising service does not mean that you will not receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.</p></p> <div><p>  Additional information and opt-out tools:</p><p>  Web browser and device settings:</p><p>  Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for interest-based advertising purposes (“DNT Notice”). Unfortunately, given how preference-based advertising works, DNT Notices may not be effective in communicating your preferences and we do not take any action based on browser based DNT Notices. The best course of action, if you do not wish to participate in interest-based advertising activities, is to follow the directions given above.</p></div> <p><p>  Lastly, should you receive marketing or promotional emails from us that you no longer wish to receive, please click the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails, contact us directly, or for certain services, by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Children </strong> [<a href="#top" target="_blank"> Back to Top </a>]Our websites, apps, services, and content are not generally directed towards children.
