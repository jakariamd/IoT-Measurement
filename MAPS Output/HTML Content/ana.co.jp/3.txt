In the event that any provisions of this Chapter 5 contradict those of Chapter 1, the provisions of this Chapter 5 shall prevail.</p></p> <div><h3>  2. The controller of personal information</h3><p>  The controller of your personal information is ANA.
ANA protects personal information which is collected and used by controllers (who make decisions about how and why your personal information is used) and processors (who act on the controller’s written instructions) on the basis of the PDPA.</p></div> <div><h3>  3. Our lawful basis for processing personal information</h3><p>  ANA protects your personal information by ensuring that it can only be used to the extent necessary for specific purposes (as set out in Part 3 of Chapter 1 of this Privacy Policy) and by requiring that there is a lawful basis for each processing activity on the basis of the PDPA.
ANA may process customer personal information on one or more of the following lawful bases:</p><ul>  <li>(1) When your consent is obtained to the processing (Article 19 PDPA)
Consent will usually only be relied upon for promotional and marketing related processing, or in some cases, in relation to sensitive personal information.</li><li>(2) When processing is necessary in order to perform or take steps to enter into a contract (Article 24(3) PDPA).
This is typically why we process customer information which is essential to providing our services, including a customer’s identity, contact, payment and travel details, etc.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>(3) ANA needs to process the information to comply with a lawful obligation (Article 24(6) PDPA).
This includes the requirement to share personal information with customs and immigration authorities or law enforcement, as well ANA’s legal duties towards its staff and customers.</li><li>(4) The information is required to protect your, or a third party’s, vital interests (Article 24(2) PDPA), for example in the event of a medical emergency.</li><li>(5) It is in ANA’s or a third party’s legitimate interests to process the personal information, and these interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights regarding your personal information under the law (Article 24(5) PDPA).
This includes the use of personal information necessary to operate ANA’s business and also to maintain, develop and improve its products and services and provide the best possible customer experience to the extent permissible under the PDPA.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  4.

If we are relying on consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time.
However, the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the processing of your personal information that you have already given consent legally before it is withdrawn.
