</li></ul></div> <div><h5>  How do companies use Adobe Experience Cloud to collect information?</h5><p>  <u> Cookies and Similar Technologies </u>. Adobe Experience Cloud solutions use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/cookies.html" target="_blank"> cookies and similar technologies </a>, such as web beacons (also known as tags or pixels), to enable companies to collect information in connection with their websites. If you look at your cookie settings in your browser, you may notice cookies from Adobe-owned domains, such as omtrdc.net and demdex.net. Most Internet browsers classify these as "third-party cookies” because they are not set by the website you are visiting. Companies using the Adobe Experience Cloud sometimes choose to use their own cookies (often called "first-party cookies”).</p></div> <p><p>  <u> Mobile </u>. A company may also use Adobe Experience Cloud technologies within its mobile apps. These technologies allow the company to send information to its Adobe Experience Cloud account -- for example, how you use the company’s mobile apps as well as other information your mobile device may make available to apps, such as location information. For more information, please review the privacy policy of the company as well as privacy information provided by your mobile device manufacturer.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Social Media </u>. When you use a company’s social media pages, the social media site you visit (on which the page is located) may allow the company to send certain information about you to its Adobe Experience Cloud account. Most social media sites allow you to configure your settings regarding how your information is used. For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of the social media sites you use.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Adobe Experience Platform Launch </u>. Adobe Experience Platform does not collect data about tag firing as part of these tag management product offerings. The Tag Manager itself does not have usage tracking about the on-page firing. With no tags deployed, Adobe Launch will set no cookies nor make any network calls. When used by a business customer of Adobe’s services, Adobe Experience Platform Launch will deliver the library containing the customer specified tags for other Adobe Experience Cloud Solutions to either (i) a customer’s own hosting provider (the recommended path) or (ii) to a 3rd party Content Delivery Network (CDN). In either scenario, the hosted server(s) to which the tags are delivered are not owned or managed by Adobe nor does Adobe own the server logs for requests made to those servers.</p></p> <p><p>  Adobe Experience Cloud solutions help our business customers manage their content; and personalize and improve the performance of their websites, apps, and marketing messages. For example, these customers may use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to collect and analyze information about how individuals use their websites.
