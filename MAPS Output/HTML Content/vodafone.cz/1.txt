information? Then please read this guideline on personal data protection
 along with the General Terms and Conditions for Provision of 
Telecommunication Services of Vodafone Czech Republic as well as the 
terms and conditions that apply to individual products and services.</p><p>  Vodafone Czech Republic. (hereafter just Vodafone) is committed to 
protecting your personal data according to the law on electronic 
communication (Nr. 127/2005), as well as the law on protection of 
personal data (Nr. 101/2000), including all amendments. </p></div> <p><p>  You can visit our public web and WAP sites, talk to Vodafone Sales 
and corporate store representatives without revealing any personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  When you give us personal data when ordering products and services, 
talking to our reps or taking part in one of our marketing campaigns and
 offers, rest assured we will only use this information within the 
limits set by law on the protection of personal data. The information 
you give is used merely to set up and maintain contact between you and 
Vodafone. </p></p> <p><p>  If you become a Vodafone subscriber, we may ask you to provide us 
with additional personal data. In such case, we will always inform you 
in advance about how and for what purpose your data will be used. At the
 same time, we will ensure that your data will only be used in ways 
consistent with the Czech laws and your interests.</p></p> <div><h2>  Personal Data</h2><p>  Your personal data will be used with your knowledge and permission 
only for the purpose of ordering or using products and services provided
 by Vodafone, or requesting data on products or services. Permission to 
provide personal data can also be granted by responding to our messages,
 surveys etc.</p><p>  Personal data that we are allowed to collect includes your name and 
permanent address or birth number. In case you take upon some of 
Vodafone´s marketing offers, we are also allowed to process your data 
necessary for performance and control of the conditions stipulated in 
the rules of such marketing offer about which you will be informed in 
advance. Additionally, you can also provide us with data on your age, 
phone number and e-mail address, lifestyle or other personal data 
provided upon registration or in surveys. If you decide to disclose your
 personal information, your data will only be used for the purpose 
stated at the time the data was collected and in line with the 
conditions you expressed.</p></div> <div><h2>  General Information on Visitors</h2><p>  We can also collect information on your visits to our web sites, WAP 
and other similar sites according to your activities on our on-line 
system. This information is not of personal nature and does not 
establish your identity. This may include information on your visits to 
web sites and the products and services you have browsed through or 
ordered. Collecting this sort of information helps us develop and modify
 our services to match your individual needs and preferences and to 
offer you customized services in the future.</p></div> <p><p>  This data is labelled as confidential and is handled accordingly, 
especially if it is utilized in connection with a Subscriber's name and 
address for the purpose of providing "services per order".</p></p> <div><h2>  Use of Information</h2><p>  We can only use your data for purposes related to provision of 
services to yourself, which includes processing orders, concluding 
contracts, managing and administrating your customer account, provision 
of services and products, or, as the case may be, data you have 
requested or responses to your complaints or inquiries about your 
account.</p><p>  Based on data collected, we can also analyse your usage of Vodafone's
 services and products and contact you by mail, phone, SMS, E-mail, fax,
 pager WAP and Internet (depending on your preferences and with your 
prior consent) with questions regarding development of new products and 
services and special promotions.</p></div> <p><p>  We can also provide you with data about the products and services of 
third parties that were carefully selected to work with Vodafone, and 
supply you with promotional and marketing information on such third 
parties, without actually providing your personal data to the latter. 
For instance, we can send you such information in the form of bill 
insert or to your personal Internet or WAP site, depending on your 
preferences and interests that you have expressed. Also, we can inform 
you about the products and services prepared for our customers in 
agreement with the third parties that may be of interest to you.</p></p> <p><p>  Before you provide your personal data please read these guidelines. 
By providing your personal data, you agree to the rules set forth 
herein. You can contact us at any time and request that your personal 
data be removed from the lists complied for marketing purposes or that 
it be updated. You can also let us know how you wish to receive data on 
our products and services, as well as the products and services of third
 parties, or notify us of the purposes that you want your data to be 
used for - the choice is up to you.</p></p> <p><p>  You have probably noticed that since September 2004 Vodafone's 
advertisement SMS include the text "Obch. sdeleni-zrus na *077" or its 
abbreviated version "OS-zrus na *077". This is the way that Vodafone 
tells you that the SMS sent is a business communication (VodafoneOS) and
 that sending business communication messages can be cancelled. So if 
you prefer not to receive Vodafone news, offers and business 
communication via SMS, you can cancel them. Just call Vodafone Care 
(*077) and tell our reps about it. They will take care of the rest. And 
of course, calling Vodafone Care is free of charge!</p></p> <div><h2>  Publication</h2><p>  Your personal and/or account data can only be disclosed and revealed in cases required by laws under the terms set forth herein.</p><p>  Please note that VodafoneMobil will not sell your personal data or 
provide it to third parties (other than in ways set out in the previous 
paragraph), unless VodafoneMobil receives your prior consent or unless 
such publication is necessary for provision of services or products you 
have ordered or are currently using.</p></div> <div><h2>  Access to your Data</h2><p>  For additional data about what kind of data we can collect or 
processed, please contact the Personal Data Protection Manager of 
Vodafone at Vinohradska 167, 100 00 Praha 10.</p><p>  If you believe that we process your personal data contrary to the 
laws specified above, you are entitled to ask us for explanation or

a large amount of information without even knowing about it. That is, this
information is collected and shared for you by cookies, Internet tags or the
web beacon.</p><p>  For example, the URL of the page you have just left is
carried over to the new page you open, along with your IP address and current
browser version.</p><p>  If you want, you can set up your browser to notify you
whenever it sends cookies, or simply turn off cookies. In this case, however,
you have to resign yourself to the fact that some functions will simply no
longer work. And what exactly is a cookie, anyway?</p></div> <p><p>  It is a part of the information that the website sends
to your browser. The page can then remember information about your selections.</p></p> <p><p>  So-called “Session Cookies” make up temporary information
that improves website navigation. They are erased the moment you turn off your
browser or computer.</p></p> <p><p>  “Persistent Cookies” are more permanent data placed on
your hard drive. They remain there until you erase them. They can store
personal information, but only if you agree to it.</p></p> <p><p>  The Internet Protocol address, the so-called IP
address, is assigned to your computer by your Internet connection provider.
Usually it is dynamic. That means that it changes with each connection to the
Internet. It is used, for example, in diagnosing problems on the server and for
website administration.</p></p> <p><p>  Internet tags are smaller than cookies and tell the
website server, for example, the IP address and browser type. They can be
placed in online ads, where they link the user to a website. They show how many
