Subject to <a href="#rules" target="_blank"> Section 8 </a> below, our collection, use, and disclosure of De-identified Information is subject to our discretion and is not subject to any of the restrictions in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may use De-identified Information for purposes such as measurement of viewership of programming and advertising, creation of tuning and viewing cohorts or segmentations, providing targeted content for our services or facilitating delivery of relevant third party advertising/promotional messages through our Services and on third party websites and other platforms. However, we do provide you with the choice to opt out of the use of your De-identified Information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising (see <a href="#how_long" target="_blank"> Section 5.c </a> below).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> To Provide Advertising, Marketing and Recommendations </strong>. Subject to <a href="#rules" target="_blank"> Section 8.b </a>, we use the Information we collect about Customers and their use of the TV and Internet Services and cable system to make program and content recommendations, to send promotional communications about the Services or other Optimum product and service offerings, and for other First Party Advertising and Third Party Advertising purposes. These promotional communications and advertisements may be directed to you because you subscribe to these Services, because of the way you use these Services, or because you live in a certain geographic area, or may be based on demographic and interest information that we collect or obtain from other sources. For example, we may use Information to facilitate the display of First Party Advertising to you on other websites, mobile applications and devices. When we do this, we may provide Service Providers with access to certain Personal Information in order to facilitate the creation of de-identified audiences (for example, based on IP address, cookie ID, device ID or other persistent identifiers) and the placement of Targeted First Party Advertising. We may also use information collected from Website Users, such as IP address, to facilitate the display of First Party Advertising to those Users on other websites, mobile applications or devices.	If you are a TV or internet subscriber, we may also use Service Providers to create similar audiences based in part on de-identified viewing or usage data, de-identified demographic or interest data, and/or the IP address(es) we assign to facilitate the sending of Targeted Third Party Advertising that we think may be of interest to you. When we do so, we maintain and use the information in de-identified form, take reasonable measures to ensure that it cannot be associated with a Customer, and do not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted under applicable law. Our sharing of information to facilitate Targeted Third Party Advertising is described in Sections <a href="#when_whom_share" target="_blank"> 4.b </a> and <a href="#when_whom_share" target="_blank"> 4.c </a> below. You can opt out of certain marketing messages as outlined in <a href="#choices" target="_blank"> Section 6 </a> below.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> CPNI Data </strong>.

Many types of wireless applications and services use device location data, including applications provided by other companies and wireless device operating systems. When you are considering new third party applications or services, you should carefully review the location-based services' or application providers' privacy policies to learn how they collect and use your information.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For Mobile customers, if your device is turned on, our network is collecting Location Data about the device location. We may use, provide access to, or disclose Location Data without your approval to provide and support the Mobile Service, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide emergency responders information about how to find you when you call 911, or as required by law or emergency. Depending on your device, you may be able to obtain services (such as mapping or ride-sharing service) that use the Location Data of your device. These services, referred to as Location-Based Services (“LBS”), are generally provided by third parties in connection with apps or websites. Third party LBS providers generally use your device operating system’s location capabilities, which can determine location independent of our network, to derive device location. We do not disclose network location data with third party LBS providers for their LBS. It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device and the privacy policies and terms under which third party LBS are provided.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><u> WHEN AND TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION. </u>.</li><li><strong> General Disclosure Policy </strong>.

We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Customers’ Information. For example, we utilize secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect certain information you provide to us; employ verification measures to protect e-mail during delivery; maintain certain Customer databases in restricted areas; and secure the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. We also limit access to databases containing Customers' Personal Information to specifically authorized employees and agents and other parties identified in <a href="#when_whom_share" target="_blank"> Section 4 </a> above. Despite these measures, we do not guarantee the security of information stored in our databases or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the Internet. As a shared resource, the Internet subjects our services and you to the risk of unauthorized access to files and data, even when security measures are implemented. If you use the Optimum Internet service to send, receive or post personal or confidential information, you do so at your own risk. Since we cannot control websites or Internet services operated by third parties that you may visit through use of our Services, we recommend that you review the terms of service and privacy policies of those websites and services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><u> SPECIAL RULES AND RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW </u>.</li><li><strong> Cable Act and Personal Information. </strong> The Cable Act imposes limitations with respect to the collection and disclosure of certain Personal Information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Policy as part of the sign-up process for our Services. Generally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personal information concerning Customers without their prior consent except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our Customers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications. In addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personal information without consent of the subscriber concerned. Also, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator. If we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available. In addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Communications Act and CPNI </strong>. Under federal law, you have a right as a VoIP or Mobile phone Customer, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI data, including but not limited to, information such as the phone numbers you call; the frequency, duration, and timing of calls; the location of your mobile device when it is in active mode (i.e., able to signal its location to nearby network facilities); billing information; and any services you have purchased. We restrict access to your CPNI. For example, Optimum Mobile and Phone call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online, but cannot be accessed without an Optimum ID and password. All other CPNI is similarly restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity. A written request may also be used to obtain your CPNI. You must send the written request to Optimum at 1111 Stewart Ave., Bethpage, NY 11714, Attn. hared Services - CDR. All requests will be verified.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Optimum also restricts the use of your CPNI. Unless we have your appropriate consent, Optimum does not disclose your CPNI to non-affiliates for marketing purposes. We may, however, use telephone CPNI or disclose de-identified information to tailor your service and to market related Optimum Phone products and services to you.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><u> ADDITIONAL STATE PRIVACY RIGHTS. </u></li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Below we include certain disclosures and additional rights that may apply to Information under applicable state data protection laws.
