                California Privacy Rights
              </span><span>  
                  If you are a California user, you have certain rights with
                  respect to the collection, use, transfer, and processing of
                  your "Personal Information," as defined by the California
                  Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). We reserve the right to limit
                  these rights where permitted under applicable law, including
                  where your identity cannot be reasonably verified or to the
                  extent your rights adversely affect the rights and freedoms of
                  others. To exercise any of the rights below, please contact us
                  via the contact information below. Only you or a person
                  registered with the California Secretary of State that you
                  authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer
                  request related to your personal information.

                  There are certain exceptions to a consumer's Right to Know,
                  including exceptions relating to employment information.

                    not be able to use certain website functions that require

</p></div> <div><span>  Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information

</span><p>  
                  You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal

</p><p>  
                  PodcastOne does not, and will not, sell any Personal information
                  of California consumers for monetary consideration. However,
                  under some circumstances a transfer of personal information to
                  a third party without monetary consideration may be considered
                  a "sale" under California law. If you submit a request to stop
                  selling your personal information, we will stop making such
                  transfers to third parties.

                  PodcastOne will not discriminate against you because you
                  exercised any of your privacy rights, including, but not
                  limited to, by: denying goods or services to you; charging
                  different prices or rates for goods or services, including
                  through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing

                  level or quality of goods or services.
                
</p></div> <div><p>  <i> Submitting Requests </i>
</p><p>  
                  You can submit your request by calling us at <strong> 310-858-0888 </strong> or
                  visiting our request website at
                  <a href="https://www.podcastone.com/privacy-information-request" target="_blank"> https://www.podcastone.com/privacy-information-request </a>. You may also submit a request via email at

</p></div> <div><p>  <i> Verifying Requests </i>
</p><p>  
                  PodcastOne provides California consumers with an online webform
                  to submit requests. The webform is accessible at
                  <a href="https://www.podcastone.com/privacy-information-request" target="_blank"> https://www.podcastone.com/privacy-information-request </a>. As stated in the webform, PodcastOne must verify that the
                  person requesting information or deletion is the California
                  consumer about whom the request relates in order to process
                  the request. To verify a California consumer's identity, we
                  may request up to three pieces of Personal Information about
                  you when you make a request to compare against our records. We
                  may also request that you sign a declaration under the penalty
                  of perjury from the consumer whose personal information is the
                  subject of the request.
                
</p></div> <p><p>  
                  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to
                  create an account with us. We will only use Personal
                  Information provided in your request to verify your identity
                  and will delete any information you provide after processing
                  the request. PodcastOne reserves the right to take additional
                  steps as necessary to verify the identity of California
                  consumers where we have reason to believe a request is
                  fraudulent.
                
</p></p> <div><p>  <i> Authorized Agents </i>
</p><p>  
                  You may choose a person registered with the California
                  Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf to
                  submit your requests ("Authorized Agent"). If you choose to
                  use an Authorized Agent, PodcastOne requires that you provide the
                  Authorized Agent with written permission to allow them to
                  submit your request and that you verify your identity directly
                  with PodcastOne. Failure to do so may result in PodcastOne denying
                  your request.
