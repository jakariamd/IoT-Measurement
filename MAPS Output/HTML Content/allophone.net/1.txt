Non-Personally Identifiable Information is anonymous and includes information such as IP address, web pages which have been viewed, date and time, search queries that have been submitted, domain type, and responses by a visitor to an advertisement and content delivered by us or a third party advertising or technology vendor. We may use different types of technologies to collect this type of information, including cookies and web beacons (1×1 pixels). Additionally, when requesting further information on the Website, we may collect additional Non-Personally Identifiable Information about the individual. Examples of Non-Personally Identifiable Information that may be requested include geographic location. None of this Non-Personally Identifiable Information, by itself, or together with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information, can by its nature be matched with a specific individual.</p></div> <div><h3>  PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3><p>  Personally Identifiable Information, as used in this Policy, means any information or set of information that identifies a specific individual, and may be collected, for example, when users request more information, subscribe to Services online, register for an account, or contribute to a chat, or in any other way submit personal information to us via the Website. Examples of Personally Identifiable Information that may be requested include your first and last name, email address, ALLO account number, CPNI customer code, user ID and/or password information, credit card or other payment information, postal address, and phone number(s). We collect this information on the Website to provide you with notices in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like, to allow you to request information from us, and otherwise correspond with you about our Services.</p></div> <p><p>  You can choose not to provide your Personally Identifiable Information by electing not to complete a form. By providing your personal information, you acknowledge and consent to our use of your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with this Policy.</p></p> <div><h2>  3.  How We Collect Information</h2><p>  We automatically collect certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information on the Website through cookies, web beacons, log files, and other common website data collection techniques. Additionally, we receive information from third parties.</p><p>  When you enter the Website, we will identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device. The IP address does not identify you personally, but it lets us identify the device you are using. We store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes. We may also collect information about the device you are using to access administrator services, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, geo- location data, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn more about what information your device makes available to us.</p></div> <div><h3>  DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h3><p>  Do Not Track is a feature in your web browser, which enables you to opt-out of the third party tracking of your online activities over time and across third party websites. We do not process or comply with any web browser’s “do not track” signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit this Website or use our Services. Third parties cannot collect any Personally Identifiable Information from this Website unless you provide it to them directly.</p></div> <div><h3>  WEBSITE COOKIES</h3><p>  The website may place “cookies” on a visitor’s computer. Cookies are small text files. Our cookies save anonymized (e.g. Non-Personally Identifiable) data about individual visitors, allowing the website to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions. The Website may use both session cookies, which terminate when a User closes his or her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the User’s computer until they expire or are manually deleted. A cookie does not retrieve any other data from your hard drive.</p></div> <p><p>  The Website may also contain coding from our third party business and technology partners, which generate third-party cookies. Third-party cookies allow these third party business and technology partners to store Non-Personally Identifiable Information, which is accessible when you visit the Website or other third party websites. We do not control use of these cookies.</p></p> <p><p>  Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them, and provide the ability to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. Blocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are using the Website, or otherwise stop certain features on the Website from functioning. Blocking cookies does stop all tracking activities described in this Policy.</p></p> <div><h3>  WEB BEACONS (1×1 PIXELS OR GIFS)</h3><p>  Our website contains coding known as Web Beacons that use 1×1 pixel images to capture and transmit the online activity of users on the Website. These Web Beacons typically transmit information about the completion of forms on the Website and other Website activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness and/or store analytics information. In addition, we may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails. This use allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients open.</p></div> <div><h3>  LOG FILES</h3><p>  Like most websites, our servers utilize log files. Log files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. Log files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track Users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our website.</p></div> <div><h3>  GOOGLE ANALYTICS ADVERTISING FEATURES</h3><p>  We use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personally Identifiable Information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank"> Google Analytics Terms of Use </a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank"> Google Privacy Policy </a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank"> disabling the Google Analytics cookie </a> on your browser. You can also view and change the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank"> currently available opt-outs </a> for Google Ads.</p></div> <p><p>  We also use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to of our website. This could be in the form of an advertisement on other websites or on the Google search results page. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Website. Any data collection will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy. You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank"> Google’s Ads Settings </a>. Alternatively, you can opt-out of a third party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page. </a></p></p> <div><h2>  4.  How We Use and Share Information</h2></div> <div><h3>  USES OF INFORMATION</h3><p>  In addition to the uses listed in other sections of this Policy, the information you provide to us and automatically-collected information (both Personally and Non-Personally Identifiable Information) is used to provide a number of different functions and services on the Website and to provide an enhanced online experience for users.
