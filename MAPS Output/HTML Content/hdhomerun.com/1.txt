<div><h1>  Privacy Information</h1></div> <div><h2>  SiliconDust Privacy Policy</h2><p>  <strong> This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of SiliconDust USA Inc. (SD). SD reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time in its sole discretion. You are at all times responsible for reading and understanding any notices regarding this Privacy Policy and the current version of this document, as well as reading and understanding the current versions of all other SD policies, procedures and guidelines relating to SD’s products (Products) and services (Services) and the SD Web Sites. A notice will be posted on our Web Sites whenever this Privacy Policy is changed in a material way. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF SD WEB SITES AND/OR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOLLOWING SD’S POSTING OF ANY CHANGES WILL CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT CONTINUE TO USE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR THE SD WEB SITES.

<strong> Please note that SD Web Sites may contain links to other sites and that these sites’ privacy policies may not conform to our own. This SD Privacy Policy does not cover third party data collection practices and SD does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties. You are solely responsible for reading and understanding the privacy and other policies of such web sites, and for complying therewith. </strong></p></div> <div><h2>  What information of yours does SD collect?</h2><p>  We collect two types of information from you, “anonymous information” and “personally identifiable information”. Anonymous information refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. Each time a visitor comes to a SD Web Site, SD collects some information to improve the overall quality of the visitor’s online experience. SD also collects aggregate search terms from its search services for internal reporting and targeted content presentation (that is, web pages which are dynamically displayed based on your individual interests). SD collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted content. In addition to anonymous data, SD may also collect personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address, credit card information, email address, products or services you purchase. SD collects personally identifiable information in the following ways from different parts of its network of web sites: Most of the personally identifiable information is gathered when you register with one or several of SD Web Sites (often when you use a computer program or other Product or Service for the first time). If you choose to register, you may provide SD with your name, postal address, email address, birth date, gender, zip or postal code and other requested information. While not all of this information may be required, the more information you provide (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your experience. SD may also specifically ask you whether we may send you information about Products and Services related to a SD purchase. SD collects information from commercial transactions, from requests for information on the SD Web Sites, and from its registration database. SD may employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language, and OEM. If you contact SD, we may keep a record of that correspondence, including your email address. We use that information so that we may respond to that email, and for future reference.</p></div> <div><h2>  What are “cookies” and how does SD use them?</h2><p>  A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you and track your activities on the web site. This unique number identifies your browser to computers whenever you visit the web site making use of them. A cookie will not allow a web site to learn any personally identifiable information (such as your real name and address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. In order to improve the SD Web Sites, we use cookies to track your visits. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. Please see the user guide or help section of your browser to make this change. For some SD Web Sites that require an authorization, cookies may not be optional; users choosing not to accept cookies may not be able to access such Web Sites or to use some or all of the Products and/or Services otherwise available on such Web Sites.</p></div> <div><h2>  What organization is collecting the information?</h2><p>  When you provide information to SD, that information is collected and maintained either by SD or by an authorized agent of SD such as web hosting companies, customer care service providers, and transaction processing service providers, unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of collection. Information provided to or collected by SD is controlled by SiliconDust USA Inc. of 5627 Stoneridge Dr, Suite 317, Pleasanton, CA 94588, United States and may be stored in the United States.</p></div> <div><h2>  How does SD use the information it collects?</h2><p>  Any personally identifiable information you provide to SD at any of the SD Web Sites is maintained and accessible only by SD and its authorized agents and business partners, unless specifically stated otherwise. SD may request information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across SD Web Sites, including personalized services, interactive communications, discussion groups, and other types of content and services. Certain of these Products and Services may be free to you and, in order to provide great content and services free of charge, SD may display advertisements. <strong> SD may collect, use, transfer and disclose anonymous information for any purpose. You can choose not to provide personally identifiable information SD may request of you, but, in general, most of the personally identifiable information SD requests is required in order to provide Products and Services, and the lack of such personally identifiable information will prevent SD from providing such Products and Services to you. </strong>
The following are examples of how SD may use the personally identifiable information it collects: SD may provide you with technical support, updates to Products and Services, and upgrades to newer products as they become available. SD may offer its users the ability to personalize content such as news, local resources, links to other web sites, and more. SD may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users to the appropriate governmental authorities. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, SD may voluntarily provide information to appropriate governmental authorities. SD sometimes uses an individual registered user’s data to “pre-populate” forms that are displayed when that user has logged in for the purpose of collecting individual data by SD and/or its advertisers and sponsors. In the event SD sells assets (or the assets of a division or subsidiary) to another entity, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, or if SD (or a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, another entity, SD may provide to such entity customer and visitor information (both aggregate and personally identifiable) that is related to that part of the business that was sold to or merged with the other entity. SD may send you email or otherwise contact you about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you, including, without limitation notification of sales, coupons, newsletters and other communications. Registering your Product or Service indicates that you have informed us of your interest, and we may contact you after registration unless you specify that you do not wish to receive such contact by notifying us at <a href="mailto:Website@silicondust.com" target="_blank"> Website@silicondust.com </a>. For those who elect to receive such materials from SD or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, SD will release personally identifiable information. Information released may include your name, email address and other information supplied in the SD registration process, and only when you specifically grant us that right. You may opt-out of any SD communications regarding products and services that we feel may be of interest to you at any time. SD may, from time to time, use your information to contact you about changes or enhancements to SD Products and Services.</p></div> <div><h2>  With whom does SD share the personally identifiable information that is collected?</h2><p>  Information about our customers and visitors to the SD Web Sites is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share personally identifiable information regarding customers only as described in this Privacy Policy and with affiliates, business partners, subsidiaries and agents that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using SD Products and Services, you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to payment processors, cloud service or other IT providers, and other companies that provide services to us). You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transferring, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted vendors, agents, or service providers of SD. Such vendors, agents and service providers are not authorized to use personally identifiable information for their own purposes or provide it to any other third parties. SD has established or may establish relationships with various service providers whose services are available to you from the SD Web Sites or from web sites that are linked to the SD Web Sites. Typically, these providers offer services that SD customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with SD Products and Services. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personally identifiable or other information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personally identifiable information that you provide while you are visiting a provider’s web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such web site, and personally identifiable information that you provide while on the SD Web Sites in conjunction with a provider’s service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. As noted above, you are solely responsible for reading and understanding the privacy and other policies of these service providers and all other third party web sites you visit. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with SD personally identifiable information collected from you. If we do receive information from a third party service provider, we may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. You should also be aware that our agreements with certain business partners whose products and/or services you have elected to acquire may require that SD share certain personally identifiable information collected from you relating to those business partners’ products and/or services. Personally identifiable information SD collects from you that is shared with business partners under such an agreement will be used by those business partners only in accordance with their privacy policies.</p></div> <div><h2>  SD notice regarding the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998</h2><p>  The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998, a United States statute, provides certain safeguards to protect children who use the Internet by regulating the online collection of personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. SD does not sell Products or Services for purchase by children, and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personally identifiable information to us. If you are a minor, you can use the SD Web Sites only in conjunction with your parents or guardians. SD and the SD Web Sites do not target children as an audience or a market, and SD does not collect information about the age of its web site users. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personally identifiable information from a child we will make all reasonable efforts to delete that data from our records.</p></div> <div><h2>  Inquiries and Complaints</h2><p>  If you have any concern about privacy at SD, please send us a thorough description of your concern to <a href="mailto:Website@silicondust.com" target="_blank"> Website@silicondust.com </a> or the address above, and we will try to resolve it.</p></div> <div><h2>  Disputes</h2><p>  If you choose to visit any SD Web Site, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Legal terms and conditions, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the State of Delaware.</p><p>  Contact: <a href="mailto:info@silicondust.com" target="_blank"> info@silicondust.com  </a>
