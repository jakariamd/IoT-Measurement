These third parties may collect information about your activities on our Dow Jones Services and on other websites or apps including offline purchases, for such purpose.  The networks use this information to show you advertisements on the Dow Jones Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests.  This information also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based advertising. To learn how to opt out of online interest-based advertising (or, as it may be called in some jurisdictions, targeted advertising), please follow the instructions in the <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=DJnotice#rightsAndChoices" target="_blank"> Your Choices and Rights </a> section below.

We may use information we collect from you in other ways for which we provide specific privacy notices at the time of collection.</p></p> <div><p>  We may share your personal data with:</p><p>  We may share your personal data with our subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Dow Jones Affiliates”) for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including for each company's marketing purposes if you have consented to such use.  A list of Dow Jones Affiliates is available in annual reports accessible <a href="https://investors.newscorp.com/node/12661/html#ex-211xfy22listofsubsidiar.htm" target="_blank"> here </a>.  Users who visit Dow Jones Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Notice.</p></div> <p><p>  If your subscription or other access is provided in whole or in part by your employer, educational institution or other third party, we may share with them information about your access to and use of your subscription or other product or service, including for access through educational institutions, your name and email address.</p></p> <p><p>  We may share some or all of your personal data identified above, as necessary for the specific services, with our service providers, who provide services to us or to you on our behalf (e.g., sending email or Text Messages on our behalf, processing payments, fulfilling orders or delivering subscriptions or improving or customizing the Dow Jones Services). These third party service providers are not authorized to use it for any other purpose than the specific service they are providing to us or to you on our behalf.</p></p> <p><p>  We may share your data with business partners to provide you with co-branded services or features that you participate in, such as conferences, events, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions ("Co-Branded Services").

The business partner's use of your information will be governed by its privacy notice.</p></p> <p><p>  We may share your information with third party partners whose offerings we think may be of interest to you.  For example, if you subscribe to the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal or Barron’s print publications, we may share your print mailing address with unaffiliated third party companies whose products and services may be of interest to you. While many of our subscribers appreciate receiving offerings from these companies, if you prefer that we do not share your information for this purpose, please refer to the <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=DJnotice#rightsAndChoices" target="_blank"> Your Choices and Rights </a> section below.</p></p> <p><p>  The above paragraph does <em> not </em> apply to personal data collected through our WSJ Amenity Text-To-Me Service.</p></p> <p><p>  As discussed in Section 2.3 of our Privacy Notice and in our <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/social-networking-services-notice/" target="_blank"> Social Networking Services Notice </a>, we may share your information when you log into or connect a social media service account with the Dow Jones Services.   The Services may also offer you the ability to share information to a social networking site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), by using integrated tools (e.g., Facebook “Like” button, or Twitter “Tweet” button). To control this sharing of information, please review and adjust your privacy settings for the relevant social network.  The social networking service's use of the shared information will be governed by its privacy notice.</p></p> <p><p>  We may disclose your personal data to law enforcement authorities or other government officials if we are required to do so to comply with subpoenas, court orders, legal process or other government measures, and to comply with other legal obligations.  We may also disclose information if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or illegal activity.</p></p> <p><p>  We may disclose information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or part of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation) to the third party or its advisors involved in such corporate transaction</p></p> <p><p>  We may disclose your personal data to protect and defend the rights, interests and safety of the Services and our users, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our and their employees, contractors and agents; and to protect the security of our Services, including when we believe necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss.</p></p> <p><p>  We offer you many choices and you may have certain rights in connection with the personal data we collect about you.</p></p> <p><p>  You may ask us to remove your information from our marketing mailing lists by changing your account settings through the appropriate link on the website account services page.

Additionally, online subscribers and registered users may access their personal data online by signing into their accounts and visiting the appropriate account management sections of our websites.

We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of personal data. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as set forth in the Contact Us section below.</p></p> <p><p>  Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals.</p></p> <p><p>  Your personal data may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than in the country in which you initially provided the data.  Applicable laws in the United States and/or other countries may allow the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities to access your personal data when in such country.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are a user located outside the United States or the country to which your information may be transferred, you understand (and, as permitted under applicable law, consent to) having any personal data processed in the United States or such country.  When we transfer your data, we will protect that data as described in this Privacy Notices. </p></p> <p><p>  In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or service or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or service or make a payment, in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy notice, rather than this Privacy Notice. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.</p></p> <p><p>  The Dow Jones Services may also be linked to sites or apps operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties, using iframes, tools, or plug-ins (“Linked Services”). These third party Linked Services may use automated means to collect information about you and your use of these features. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Dow Jones logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us.</p></p> <p><p>  Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable third party privacy notice.</p></p> <p><p>  Dow Jones may periodically update this Privacy Notice without prior notice to reflect changes in our privacy practices and the Dow Jones Services. If we modify the Privacy Notice, we will update the Effective Date and the changes will become effective as of the date we post such Notice. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a prominent notice on the Dow Jones Services indicating we have updated this Privacy Notice.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have questions about this Privacy Notice or how we or our service providers handle your personal data, please contact our privacy team at <a href="mailto:privacypolicy@dowjones.com" target="_blank"> privacypolicy@dowjones.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Or you may write to:
