We provide technology that helps advertisers and their advertising agencies manage digital advertising campaigns across many channels, such as websites, apps, audio, smart TVs, and other video. The advertising campaigns run by our clients help pay for the content you enjoy.</p></div> <p><p>  We, and our clients, collect and use data both to help ensure that the ads you see are relevant and to measure and report on their effectiveness.</p></p> <p><p>  Our Platform uses data to produce a mapping of devices that might be related to each other, meaning that they might be used by the same person or by people within the same household. This helps advertisers better target and measure their campaigns, as well as limiting the number of times the same person or household sees an ad.</p></p> <p><p>  Our references to our Platform in this policy only refer to the Trade Desk’s own advertising technology platform and do not include the technology or systems of clients or partners that use or integrate with us. Clients and partners are bound by our policies when they use our Platform.</p></p> <p><p>  The Trade Desk is a member of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative </a> (NAI) and adheres to the NAI’s 2020 Code of Conduct. The Trade Desk also follows the industry self-regulatory guidelines of the <a href="http://aboutads.info/" target="_blank"> Digital Advertising Alliance </a>, the <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank"> Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada </a>, and the <a href="http://youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank"> European Digital Advertising Alliance </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  The Trade Desk also implements and adheres to the specifications and policies of the IAB EU Transparency & Consent Framework as part of our compliance with EU data protection law. The Trade Desk’s identification number within the Framework is 21.

More detailed information is available below.</p><p>  <strong> Full Privacy Policy </strong></p><p>  Below, we explain in detail the type of data we collect, how we collect it, how we use it, and how we disclose it, as well as the choices available to you. If after reading this policy you still have questions, please feel free to contact us <a href="https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/2abc1a63-35c5-4ef7-b11b-1c55714738b5/4c5ba598-b05c-4b1c-b3da-abab6ac1c9db" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> THE PLATFORM </strong></p><p>  The Platform allows advertisers and advertising agencies to manage digital advertising campaigns. We operate as a Demand Side Platform; this means we represent the demand side of the digital advertising marketplace, in which advertisers and agencies with ads to display are the “demand” and publishers with space for such ads on web pages, apps, smart TVs and other digital properties are the “supply”.</p><p>  Digital advertising uses identifiers and associated data to make ads more effective and to measure their effectiveness. Without identifiers, our advertiser clients wouldn’t know, for example, if a 100 ad views were the result of 100 different users that each saw an ad, or if one user saw the same ad 100 times. This information is crucial to advertisers. Without information like this, advertisers would pay publishers much less, forcing publishers to either show more ads or make users pay for their content.</p></div> <p><p>  Advertisers and their agencies collect and use data on the Platform in different ways. They may bring their own data to the Platform, collect data using the Platform, or remove their data from the Platform.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> THE DATA THE PLATFORM COLLECTS AND PROCESSES </strong></p><p>  The Platform collects and processes pseudonymous data about users, households, devices, and ads and where they’re shown. This includes:</p><ul>  <li>unique cookie identifiers</li><li>device advertising identifiers</li><li>pseudonymous identifiers derived from email address or phone numbers</li><li>IP addresses</li><li>Interest and demographic information stored and/or used on the Platform by clients and partners</li><li>Interest and demographic information we create or infer</li><li>other information about browsers and devices, such as type, version and settings</li><li>location information based on IP address or other types of information that may include precise geolocation information (i.e., latitude/longitude coordinates), if provided to us</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>information about ads that are shown, such as which ads are shown to a device or user, where (which web page or app) they are shown, and at what time</li><li>hashed email addresses and other identifying information (or information derived from such)</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> HOW THE PLATFORM COLLECTS DATA </strong></p><p>  The Platform receives data in several ways, including the following:</p><ul>  <li>Advertisers and agencies may bring or collect their own information to our Platform (for example, that they collect on their own websites through the use of Platform technology) that we then store and use on their behalf to enhance their advertising campaigns.</li><li>Bid requests, which are sets of information that describe an ad space that is available to be filled. We get these requests from the “supply” side of the advertising ecosystem, meaning websites, apps, smart TVs, and others, as well as their agents. The requests contain information about the ad space, the device, and sometimes the user, including location information. They also usually have an ID (or IDs) that enables us to match the request with information we may already have.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Third-party suppliers of information used to target, optimize or measure advertising campaigns.</li><li>Purveyors of connected TV devices and apps can send us information about the video content viewed on the device or app.</li><li>Pixels and cookies, which allow us to recognize web browsers across sites and over time, and therefore to record information about them over time.</li><li>Mobile device IDs, which are made available through the device operating systems, like Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, for purposes of allowing mobile apps and their advertising partners to recognize a device over time. We use these IDs in a similar way to the way we use cookies.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Mobile SDKs are bits of code that some of our partners enable to be placed in mobile apps. This enables our partners to send us data about the mobile app and device in association with the mobile device ID.</li><li>After an ad serves, our servers receive a network request from the device on which the ad was shown in order to confirm that the ad was delivered and provide information for us to measure the ad.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> COOKIES </strong></p><p>  Cookies help us by enabling our ability to distinguish between, recognize, and store data about unique web browsers and devices, and to store data on our servers for the advertising purposes described here. Our cookie domain is adsrvr.org. The Trade Desk ID (TDID) is used to recognize web-browser profiles over time across sites. The TDID has a lifespan of 1 year from the time you last received an ad powered by Platform. This lifespan may be updated each time your browser encounters our Platform.</p></div> <p><p>  In order to be able to transmit requests for ads and other data about users or devices between sellers and buyers, and to help show you ads that match your likely interests, we engage in cookie syncing, meaning that we match our TDID to clients’ and partners’ cookie IDs. We also use a cookie to store a related opt-out choice, when users opt out of cookie based targeted advertising.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE PLATFORM PROCESSES DATA </strong></p><p>  The Platform processes data both on our own behalf and on behalf of clients and partners for purposes related to targeting, delivering, measuring and reporting on advertising.</p><ul>  <li>Personalizing ads: We use data to increase advertising relevancy and effectiveness.</li><li>Ad delivery: We use data to enable the technical delivery of an ad and measure success of delivery.</li><li>Frequency and other reporting: We use a pseudonymous identifier to keep track of how many times an ad was shown, as well as where and when.</li><li>Measurement and analytics: We use an identifier to measure how well ads perform, such as whether users clicked on the ad or went to a client’s store after their ad campaign was shown.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Reporting: We may use a pseudonymous identifier to measure, attribute, and report on the performance and success of campaigns. This includes transaction reporting and verification.</li><li>Clicks and conversions: We may use a pseudonymous identifier to measure actions taken by a user with respect to a particular ad, i.e., a click on an ad, or a download of an app.</li><li>Attribution: We may use data to match particular ad views to subsequent actions taken by a user. For example, a clothing advertiser might be able to see that someone who saw an ad for gloves subsequently purchased the gloves. This would be done by stitching together the identifiers from the sites where the ad was served and where the online purchase was made. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Cross device graphing: We may use data and algorithms to associate pseudonymous identifiers that might be related to each other. Such a graph might link various identifiers present on a single device, various identifiers associated with an individual who has multiple devices or multiple device/individuals within the same household.</li><li>Detection of malicious or invalid activity: We process information in an attempt to prevent malicious activity or invalid ad traffic. This may include identifying and preventing purveyors of malware or bots that try to take advertising dollars for ads that aren’t shown to real users or that try to harm users’ devices.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> TARGETED ADVERTISING </strong></p><p>  Our Platform helps power ad targeting and delivery across many sites and apps with which users interact every day. Many of the activities described in the section above, such as personalizing ads, ad delivery, and cross-device graphing may involve The Trade Desk and our clients and partners processing data for purposes of “targeted advertising,” or engaging “sales,” or “sharing” of personal data under certain state privacy laws. See <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/privacy#rights-and-choices" target="_blank"> Your Rights and Choices </a> below to learn how to express a choice related to these activities, or visit our <a href="http://www.adsrvr.org/" target="_blank"> opt-out page </a>.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> PERSONALISATION AND INTERESTS </strong></p><p>  <strong> Personalised profiles.  </strong>As part of our Platform, we may create and use user profiles associated with pseudonymous identifiers. This means that we look at the information associated with the IDs and with the requests for ads, such as the content in which the ad is shown, the time, the geographic location, and the type of device. Sometimes we use information about whether or how users responded to ads to find other users who would respond to ads. We apply various computational methods on this information to find groupings of IDs that may have certain common interests or characteristics, such as “clothing,” “sports,” “travel,” “male,” “25-54,” and so on. Our Platform also enables data suppliers to bring data to the Platform that our clients can use on the Platform to improve their ad campaigns.</p></div> <p><p>  Clients can bring their own data to the Platform for their own personalisation. Their sources and methods for acquiring this data vary and are subject to our clients’ own policies and legal obligations. We contractually prohibit certain types of data from being introduced onto the Platform, such as certain sensitive data, as further described below.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Interests for groups.  </strong>We also create and use information that allows advertisers to understand what will be of interest to a group. We create a group of IP addresses in the same region of a country. We note what content we think is likely to be of interest to that group (as above, such as “clothing”, “sports” etc.) based on the sites users in those groups have visited. Advertisers may use this information to decide to show an ad to one of the IP addresses for the group. Identifiers for the group do not contain any personal data: the information only shows the types of content likely to be of interest to the group; we don’t create any individual profiles through this interest grouping mechanism. We keep these interests for groups segments for seven days.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Special types of interests.  </strong>As required under the NAI Code, the Trade Desk discloses standard interest segments that are based on <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/documents/HealthSegments_PrivacyPolicy_210208_164431.pdf" target="_blank"> health related information or interests </a> and <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/assets/global/documents/NAI_PoliticalSegments_PrivacyPolicy.pdf" target="_blank"> political information or interests </a> that it makes available in the Platform where permitted by law and self-regulatory rules. Personal data that is considered “sensitive” or in special categories according to certain laws and rules, including personal data about children, may be subject to restrictions on the Platform. Some examples of sensitive data may include information related to your health, such as information on certain past, present, or future medical conditions, and information about race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion, and precise geolocation information. Our contracts prohibit clients and partners from using data on the Platform that is from or about users that they know are children.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> DISCLOSURE AND TRANSFER </strong></p><p>  We will disclose your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this policy.</p><ul>  <li>Some of the personal data processed on the Platform belongs to our clients. When this is the case, our clients can take this data, such as records of advertising impressions, off of the Platform. We also may disclose this personal data to other parties on the clients’ behalf and pursuant to their instructions.</li><li>We disclose mappings of pseudonymous IDs with clients and partners that use our device graphs.</li><li>We disclose cookie values to other advertising technology platforms so that they may match their value to our value.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Some of our clients and partners receive bid request data through the Platform for advertising purposes.</li><li>We may disclose personal data in order to investigate or prevent reasonably suspected malicious activity, fake traffic, or other activity that may be harmful to us or our clients.</li><li>We may disclose personal data to our service providers that store or process the personal data in furtherance of the services we offer on the Platform on our behalf.</li><li>We may transfer personal data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>We may disclose aggregated data that does not include individual-level records to any party or publicly.</li><li>We may disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </strong></p><p>  We transfer data to the US under a valid transfer mechanism such as, if deemed necessary under applicable data protection legislation, the standard contractual clauses for data transfers, as approved by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 for the transfer of Personal Data to third countries. If there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and such mechanism, the terms of the transfer mechanism shall govern.</p></div> <p><p>  We commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data and are subject to enforcement by the US Federal Trade Commission. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy policy should first contact us <a href="https://privacyportal-eu.onetrust.com/webform/2abc1a63-35c5-4ef7-b11b-1c55714738b5/4c5ba598-b05c-4b1c-b3da-abab6ac1c9db" target="_blank"> by completing this form </a>.

We now rely on other transfer mechanisms for the cross-border transfer of data. However, The Trade Desk continues to live up to its obligations under the program. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.

After 18 months (often sooner) the data is de-identified or aggregated and stored for up to 3 additional years. For interests for groups, we retain data for 7 days. This retention policy does not apply to client or partner data. We have implemented security measures, including physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, designed to prevent the unauthorized access to, loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that our Platform collects, but we make no assurances in this policy about our ability to prevent any such event or the possible harm to you or any third party that could arise from it.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES </strong></p><p>  <strong> Privacy rights.  </strong>Depending upon where you live, you may have certain legal rights with respect to data The Trade Desk collects and processes. These rights may include the right to request access, deletion, and correction of personal data, and the right to opt out of activities that constitute “sales,” “sharing,” and processing personal data for purposes of “targeted advertising,” as well as use of “sensitive data” for advertising purposes, as such terms are defined under certain state privacy laws in the United States. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person or infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information that we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interest in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under applicable law.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Opting out of sales, sharing and targeted advertising. </strong> As described in the Targeted Advertising section above, we process data to personalize and deliver ads, and for other ads-related purposes, including measurement reporting, and building our cross-device graph. Some of these activities may be considered “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information or using your information for purposes of “targeted advertising” under the law that applies to you. You may express a choice related to these activities, including use of sensitive data for such purposes, by visiting <a href="http://www.adsrvr.org" target="_blank"> http://www.adsrvr.org </a> or by enabling Global Privacy Control in your browser. Your devices like CTVs and Mobile Devices may offer choice signaling from the device’s operating system. Where we receive these signals, TTD will opt the user out of sales, sharing and targeted advertising. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Industry opt-out pages.  </strong>The online advertising industry provides websites from which you may set a third party cookie indicating your desire to opt out of interest-based advertising from the Trade Desk and other companies that participate in industry self-regulatory programs.

Under the definitions of “Controller” and “Processor” in EU law, this processing is in some cases as a Controller of personal data and in some cases as a Processor.

We process personal data for other purposes when we have a legitimate interest in doing so and that interest is not outweighed by the rights or freedoms of individual data subjects.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> CHANGES TO OUR POLICIES </strong></p><p>  We may revise this policy at any time, and we will indicate revisions by updating the date at the top of this policy and providing notice through our websites or services.</p><p>  <strong> CONTACT US </strong></p><p>  You may contact us regarding privacy.</p><p>  <strong> Global Data Protection Officer (DPO)  </strong>The Trade Desk, Global Privacy Office 42 N.
