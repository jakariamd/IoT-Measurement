You cannot change it unless you remove the extension. What a waste. Could have actually been a good extension.
Google is better for general searches, DuckDuckGo when Google fails you.</div></div> <div><div>  Was this review helpful?</div><label>  Yes</label><label>  No</label><span>  Trudie Carter</span><span>  16 hours ago</span><div>  Unfortunately, this is not in our control.

However, it is causing dates to appear incorrectly in Zoho CRM - I eventually figured out DDG was the Google Chrome extension causing the problem and have had to disable this great browser extension completely because of this. I wish this extension allowed me to somehow exclude specific sites when the extension causes an issue. I hope DuckDuckGo gives us this option in the future and I will revise my review to five stars</div></div> <div><div>  Was this review helpful?</div><label>  Yes</label><label>  No</label><span>  Eric Picard</span><span>  Jun 19, 2023</span><div>  I believe they have a feature that allows you to do that. In the desktop chrome extension you just go to the site you're using, and you turn Protections OFF for this site (it defaults to ON and is a blue toggle switch.) You should also select the Website not working as expected link. If you download their app on Desktop or mobile you also have the option to Fireproof a site - which means they don't delete your cookies for that site and keep you signed in.</div></div> <div><div>  Was this review helpful?</div><label>  Yes</label><label>  No</label><span>  Randy Nilsson</span><span>  Jun 29, 2023</span><div>  Would like to see duck duck go provide maping services.

I like that I didn't have to think about all the advertisements and stuff that I may be targeted with, but over the past week or so, it has become disappointing.  It slows down and gives me that a search cannot be completed, it won't reload, and I repeatedly have to check my connections to see if it's my wireless or the program.  I don't know if the servers have been off line, but I can't do my work from home with these interruptions in data flow, so I'm having to stop using the extension until DuckDuckGo can get their stuff together.</div></div> <div><div>  Was this review helpful?</div><label>  Yes</label><label>  No</label><span>  ersin karakadıoğlu</span><span>  Jun 18, 2023</span><div>  It's significantly slowing down web canvas games, please fix.</div><div>  Was this review helpful?</div><label>  Yes</label><label>  No</label><span>  Ken Worthy</span><span>  Jun 15, 2023</span><div>  It is currently interfering with use of Canvas Learning Management System (pages take a very long time to load).
