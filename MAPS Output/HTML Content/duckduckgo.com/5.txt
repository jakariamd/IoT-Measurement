            </h2></div> <div><h3>  DuckDuckGo Web Tracking Protections</h3><p>  DuckDuckGo <a href="/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/no-tracking/" target="_blank"> never tracks you </a>. And when you leave our search engine and use our apps or extensions to browse other sites, we aim to protect your privacy as much as possible. To be effective, browser tracking protection needs to continually evolve to mitigate how trackers attempt to evade specific protections. That’s why we offer multiple types of web tracking protections. Other browsers offer some of these by default, like cookie and fingerprinting protections, but we also provide many other protections that most browsers do not offer by default, like <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a>, <a href="#global-privacy-control-gpc" target="_blank"> Global Privacy Control </a>, <a href="#link-tracking-protection" target="_blank"> Link Tracking Protection </a>, <a href="#cname-cloaking-protection" target="_blank"> CNAME Cloaking Protection </a>, <a href="#google-amp-protection" target="_blank"> Google AMP Protection </a>, and more, which all help cover different tracking angles.</p></div> <p><p>  For example, most browsers’ default tracking protection focuses on cookie and fingerprinting protections that only restrict trackers after they load in your browser. Unfortunately, that level of protection leaves information like your IP address and other identifiers sent with loading requests vulnerable to profiling. We offer our <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a> to help address this vulnerability, which stops most 3rd-party trackers from loading in the first place, providing significantly more protection.</p></p> <p><p>  We created this page to explain how each of our web tracking protections works, how our protections work across supported platforms, and how they work together to provide overlapping protection. Our non-beta apps and extensions are also <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo" target="_blank"> open source </a>, which means that anyone can examine their source code and how our web tracking protections are coded. To identify trackers, we crawl the web with our <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/" target="_blank"> Tracker Radar </a>, which is also <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar" target="_blank"> open source </a>, as is our <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-blocklists" target="_blank"> list of trackers </a>. While no one can eliminate <em> all </em> hidden tracking or <em> all </em> profiling online, we aim to prevent most 3rd-party tracking through the overlapping protections described on this page. At the same time, we aim to <a href="#preserving-site-functionality" target="_blank"> preserve site functionality </a> as much as possible, for example making sure our Web Tracking Protections don’t interfere with your ability to view websites correctly, sign in to sites, or make online purchases.</p></p> <div><h2>  3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection</h2><p>  When you visit a website, the web address (URL) in your browser’s address bar tells your browser where to go. What you may not realize, is that sites also try to load other URLs in the background while your destination page is loading. Many of those URLs come from other companies, commonly referred to as “3rd parties.”</p><p>  Sites often embed these 3rd-party requests to support site functionality, but they can also be used to track you. We crawl the web with <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/" target="_blank"> Tracker Radar </a> to identify tracking requests and maintain our own <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-blocklists" target="_blank"> list of trackers </a>. For example, the most prevalent 3rd-party tracker on the Internet is Google Analytics. Requests to Google Analytics URLs are embedded <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/traffic/Entire-Internet" target="_blank"> on millions of sites </a> to help the owners understand how their sites are being used. But typically, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1011397" target="_blank"> can also use this </a> to profile you outside of the site where the information originated.</p></div> <p><p>  Most browsers that offer web tracking protections are usually talking about cookie tracking protections (described in <a href="#3rd-party-cookie-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-party </a> and <a href="#1st-party-cookie-protection" target="_blank"> 1st-party </a> cookie protection). However, these types of protections can only restrict 3rd-party trackers after they load in your browser, and these 3rd parties still get access to information that could be used to track you across sites as part of the loading process (like IP address or other identifiers sent with the loading request). To protect against this tracking, you need a web tracking protection that actually stops most 3rd-party tracking requests from loading in the first place. This type of protection comes built-in with all our apps and extensions, and goes well beyond the web tracking protections most popular browsers offer by default.</p></p> <p><p>  This protection is particularly difficult to provide without causing usability issues because some websites depend on code that loads from these embedded requests. We can sometimes work around this with <a href="#surrogates" target="_blank"> Surrogates </a>. In other cases, we may make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when it would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. It’s also important to note that the intention of 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection is not to stop all 3rd-party requests from loading, just those used for 3rd-party tracking. For example, <a href="#infrastructure-domains" target="_blank"> infrastructure domains </a> require more nuanced classification since they don’t always serve tracking content. Additionally 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection may also behave differently following a click on a <a href="#duckduckgo-private-search-ads" target="_blank"> DuckDuckGo Private Search Ad </a>.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  Safari extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td></div> <div><td>  Android app</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  Mac app</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td><td>  Windows app</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from loading.</td></div> <div><h2>  3rd-Party Cookie Protection</h2><p>  Believe it or not, web “cookies” were originally designed to be a helpful data storage mechanism. However, 3rd-party cookies have become one of the most common methods of web tracking.</p><p>  If you notice the same ads following you around, 3rd-party cookies may be to blame because they can easily track you as you browse from site to site. That’s because even though third-party cookies are created on one site, they can be retrieved from another. For example, if you visit a website which uses Google’s ad network, it can create a 3rd-party cookie based on the content you are viewing. Then, when you visit another website that also uses Google ads, Google can read the initial cookie, know that you’re the same person, and show you an ad based on what you were viewing on the previous site.</p></div> <p><p>  To protect against this, we first block most 3rd-party tracking requests with <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a>, which stops requests from loading that would otherwise have a chance to create or access 3rd-party cookies. In addition, we also automatically block 3rd-party cookies on our list of known trackers by default, and will only make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when it would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  3rd-party cookies from domains on our list blocked. 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from setting or accessing 3rd-party cookies.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  3rd-party cookies from domains on our list blocked. 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from setting or accessing 3rd-party cookies.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  3rd-party cookies from domains on our list blocked. 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from setting or accessing 3rd-party cookies.</td></div> <div><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  3rd-party cookies from domains on our list blocked. 3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from setting or accessing 3rd-party cookies.</td><td>  Safari extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from creating or accessing 3rd-party cookies, and 3rd-party cookies also blocked through WebKit’s <a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/#the-default-cookie-policy" target="_blank"> built-in cookie tracking protection </a>.</td><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td></div> <td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from creating or accessing 3rd-party cookies, and 3rd-party cookies also blocked through WebKit’s <a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/#the-default-cookie-policy" target="_blank"> built-in cookie tracking protection </a>.</td></td> <div><td>  Android app</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from creating or accessing 3rd-party cookies.

However, 1st-party cookies can still be used to re-identify you when you later return to a website. This can be helpful when used to recognize that you’re still signed in, but 1st-party cookies can also be used to monitor your activity on sites over time and facilitate cross-site tracking. That’s because identifiers stored in 1st-party cookies can be sent to 3rd-party companies when their requests are directly embedded in the content of a website.</p></div> <p><p>  To protect against this, we first block most embedded 3rd-party tracking requests before they even have a chance to create or access 1st-party cookies, because we stop those requests from loading with <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a>. We also do the same for many 3rd-party requests that are disguised as 1st parties with <a href="#cname-cloaking-protection" target="_blank"> CNAME Cloaking Protection </a>. We’re sometimes unable to block 3rd-party tracking requests because doing so would break site functionality. Since these unblocked 3rd parties may be able to set 1st-party cookies, we automatically set a 24-hour expiration on those cookies to limit their privacy impact. In addition, we set a 7-day expiration for all other 1st-party cookies created by scripts. We may make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when these rules would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. We may also alter the behavior of 1st-Party Cookie Protection following a click on a <a href="#duckduckgo-private-search-ads" target="_blank"> DuckDuckGo Private Search Ad </a>.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  3rd-party scripts on our list blocked from creating or accessing 1st-party cookies, including those impersonating 1st parties on our CNAME list.

This can help them escape common 3rd-party tracking protections. For example,  looks like it belongs to the  website owner, but the  subdomain may actually have a 3rd-party tracking company behind it.</p><p>  We identify 3rd-party domains trying to track you in this way through our open source <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar" target="_blank"> Tracker Radar </a> crawl. We then help protect against CNAME cloaking by treating those domains as proper 3rd parties, such that we can then apply <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a> and other web tracking protections. This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default.</p></div> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  Treats 1st-party requests on our CNAME list as 3rd parties.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  Treats 1st-party requests on our CNAME list as 3rd parties.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  Treats 1st-party requests on our CNAME list as 3rd parties.</td><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  Treats 1st-party requests on our CNAME list as 3rd parties.</td><td>  Safari extension</td><td>  Unsupported, but on our product roadmap.</td><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td><td>  Treats 1st-party requests on a subset of our CNAME list as 3rd parties.

This widespread tracking technique is known as “fingerprinting” or “device fingerprinting” and is one way tracking companies try to get around cookie tracking protections. They do this by running JavaScript code and using browser APIs to ask the browser to reveal and return information about itself and the device it’s running on (for example, screen size and CPU type).</p></div> <p><p>  To protect against this, we block many fingerprinting scripts before they can even load with our <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a>. In addition, we override many of the browser APIs used for fingerprinting to make them return either no information or alternative information that’s less useful for fingerprinting. We will only make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when it would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality.

If the web address starts with  (with an s at the end), the Internet connection is encrypted, and anyone trying to spy on you (like your Internet provider or Wi-Fi snoopers) can’t see anything beyond the website you’re going to.</p></div> <p><p>  To offer Smarter Encryption (automatic HTTPS upgrading), we crawl the web continuously, look for sites that fully support HTTPS across their entire website, and maintain a list of the sites we find within our apps and extensions. You can review the <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/smarter-encryption" target="_blank"> open source code </a> for our crawler. If you try to navigate to one of these sites unencrypted (http), for example from a social media link, we automatically change to encrypted (https) for any site on our list.</p></p> <p><p>  Except for Safari, most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, such as when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. Otherwise, they only offer additional HTTPS upgrading functionality if you opt-in to advanced settings or use certain modes (like private browsing). By contrast, Smarter Encryption covers all clicks and interactions as you browse the web, including clicks from social media, search engines, and other websites.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  Upgrades our full list of domains.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  Upgrades our full list of domains.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  Upgrades our full list of domains.</td><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  Upgrades our full list of domains.</td><td>  Safari extension</td><td>  Upgrades domains through WebKit’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes/safari-15-release-notes" target="_blank"> built-in automatic HTTPS upgrading </a>.</td></div> <div><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td><td>  Upgrades a subset of our full list of domains that covers approximately 90% of search engine clicks.

Part of this header is known as the “referrer,” which allows a server to identify the last place a user was before they arrived on that site. Sometimes this is used for security checks (like when you sign in to a website), but it can also be hijacked by companies to send along additional data that could help them track and fingerprint you.</p></div> <p><p>  By default, we “trim” (remove) some of the metadata in the “referrer header” that trackers could potentially use to track you individually.

Otherwise, we load the AMP link in the background, and <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/BrowserServicesKit/blob/main/Sources/BrowserServicesKit/LinkProtection/AMPCanonicalExtractor.swift" target="_blank"> block all content from loading </a>, separate from your normal browsing experience. This allows us to extract the publisher link, delete all data from that background load and then load the publisher webpage, as normal. This helps protect you from the additional Google tracking that may not be present on the original webpage. We may make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Safari extension</td><td>  Unsupported due to limitations of the current <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions" target="_blank"> App Extensions </a> architecture, but on our product roadmap to adopt the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions" target="_blank"> Web Extensions </a> architecture and add Google AMP protection.</td></div> <div><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Android app</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Mac app</td><td>  Google AMP links replaced wherever detected.</td><td>  Windows app</td><td>  Unsupported, but on our product roadmap.</td></div> <div><h3>  Google Topics Protection</h3><p>  Google is attempting to replace 3rd-party cookies within their browser with an alternative tracking mechanism called <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2022/03/what-to-expect-from-ps-testing.html" target="_blank"> Topics </a>. For Google Chrome users, Topics can use your Chrome browsing history to automatically infer your interests and align them with a predefined list of topics (for example, “Child Internet Safety” or “Personal Loans”). A subset of this list is shared with websites and other tracking companies so they can target you with ads just as easily — based on your behavior and without your knowledge.</p></div> <p><p>  The DuckDuckGo Chrome extension disables Topics from running in Google Chrome. We may make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality.

Its ultimate goal is also to “re-target” you with ads — in other words, letting Google ads <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2022/03/what-to-expect-from-ps-testing.html" target="_blank"> follow you from website to website </a>. FLEDGE works directly in the Chrome browser and <a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v1.md" target="_blank"> uses your browsing history </a> to run ad auctions in order to re-target you better and without you realizing it.</p></div> <p><p>  The DuckDuckGo Chrome extension disables FLEDGE from running in Google Chrome.

Opting to sign in using your Google Account can give Google implicit permission to collect even more data about your activity on sites than they would typically have access to when you’re not signed in or if you chose a different sign-in method.</p><p>  To help protect against being misled into unwanted tracking, we block these annoying Google sign-in pop-ups by default on sites Google doesn’t own wherever possible. We may make a <a href="#remotely-configured-exceptions" target="_blank"> limited exception </a> when this protection would prevent you from signing in to a site or to otherwise preserve essential site functionality. That means you can take back your choice to sign in with any account (including a Google Account) and use standard website sign-in forms instead.</p></div> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Safari extension</td><td>  Unsupported due to limitations of the current <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions" target="_blank"> App Extensions </a> architecture, but on our product roadmap to adopt the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions" target="_blank"> Web Extensions </a> architecture and add Google Sign-in Pop-up protection.</td></div> <div><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Android app</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Mac app</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td><td>  Windows app</td><td>  Google sign-in pop-ups hidden wherever detected.</td></div> <div><h2>  Preserving Site Functionality</h2><p>  We aim to deliver privacy, simplified. Part of our ethos of simplicity is not breaking website functionality in the process of blocking and restricting trackers. We develop our protections with this mind, and we use the following techniques to further this effort as we continue to expand protections.</p></div> <div><h3>  Surrogates</h3><p>  Sometimes sites depend on code that loads from embedded 3rd-party tracking script requests in order to function properly. When our <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a> stops these from loading, it can cause sites to behave unexpectedly. However, we can sometimes create small pieces of code called “surrogates” that work around this tracker-dependent breakage so that we can still stop those trackers from loading.</p></div> <p><p>  A surrogate works locally on your device, pretending to be a particular 3rd-party tracking script without actually doing any tracking. Surrogates replicate the expected script’s API structure with all tracking components removed, including any remote server calls. This lets us neutralize the parts that would have tried to track you while allowing websites to load and function properly. You can <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-surrogates" target="_blank"> review our open source code </a> for this feature. Surrogates are not offered in most popular browsers by default.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list.</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list.</td><td>  Edge extension</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list.</td><td>  Opera extension</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list.</td><td>  Safari extension</td></div> <td><td>  Unsupported, but on our product roadmap.</td></td> <div><td>  iPhone & iPad app</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list, but some usability issues may still occur due to platform limitations that cause 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to block scripts before we have a chance to apply Surrogates.</td><td>  Android app</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list.</td><td>  Mac app</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list, but some usability issues may still occur due to platform limitations that cause 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to block scripts before we have a chance to apply Surrogates.</td></div> <div><td>  Windows app</td><td>  Surrogates preserve privacy and usability for tracker-dependent breakage on our list.</td></div> <div><h3>  Remotely Configured Exceptions</h3><p>  If you’re using our app or extension and suspect that a website usability issue was caused by one of the Web Tracking Protections detailed on this page, you can let us know by submitting a Broken Site Report. You can also temporarily disable DuckDuckGo’s Privacy Protection for individual websites to troubleshoot the issue you’re experiencing.</p><p>  We review user-reported Broken Site Reports daily, and work to address these usability issues continuously. When one of our Web Tracking Protections causes issues to occur (for example, if users can’t sign in or can’t use a popular website), we may add a site domain or cookie to a temporary exclusion list for that protection. This preserves essential usability for all users as we work toward a better solution. All of our privacy apps and extensions rely on these <a href="https://github.com/duckduckgo/privacy-configuration" target="_blank"> open source lists </a>, which vary by platform and protection, to maintain a seamless online experience.</p></div> <div><td>  All platforms</td><td>  All platforms provide feedback channels for reporting tracker-dependent breakage.</td></div> <div><h3>  Infrastructure Domains</h3><p>  Most websites cannot build all of their technology in-house and must rely on 3rd parties for site functionality. We don’t want to penalize websites for using a 3rd party so long as their use of that 3rd party doesn’t help track you across websites. In this way, we hope to encourage good 3rd-party script behaviors over time.</p><p>  We consider some domains on our list to be “Infrastructure Domains,” for example Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and tag managers, since these domains are often used to load website functionality (i.e., infrastructure, like images, videos, and site elements you interact with) from other 3rd-party domains. However, Infrastructure Domains can be used to load both tracking and non-tracking resources.</p></div> <p><p>  Because blocking Infrastructure Domains from loading any resources creates significant site breakage and prevents sites from loading resources they rely on, we take the approach of evaluating individual resources loaded from Infrastructure Domains, and apply <a href="#3rd-party-tracker-loading-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection </a> to those specific resources that we observe participating in tracking, taking into account the potential for site breakage. In addition, we apply our other overlapping protections (like <a href="#3rd-party-cookie-protection" target="_blank"> 3rd-Party Cookie Protection </a>) to Infrastructure Domains directly.</p></p> <p><p>  For example, a domain that hosts open-source JavaScript libraries would be considered a CDN and thus not blocked by 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, but any instance of the FingerprintJS fingerprinting library hosted on that domain would be blocked because it’s used to fingerprint you and track you around the web. Likewise, 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection doesn’t apply to Google Tag Manager, as we have not detected the tag manager itself participating in tracking, we’ve observed it associated with breakage on many sites, and it occasionally loads necessary features like site widgets and privacy-friendly analytics libraries. However, we continue to block tracking resources Google Tag Manager may load, such as Google Analytics, and we also block Google Tag Manager itself on sites where we’ve detected embedded fingerprinting code within it. Other Infrastructure Domains are treated similarly.</p></p> <div><td>  All platforms</td><td>  Infrastructure Domain categorization impacts how we build our tracker lists, which are shared across platforms.</td></div> <div><h3>  DuckDuckGo Private Search Ads</h3><p>  Advertising on DuckDuckGo is done in partnership with Microsoft. Viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous, and Microsoft has <a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/company/ads-by-microsoft-on-duckduckgo-private-search" target="_blank"> committed </a> to not profile our users on ad clicks: “when you click on a Microsoft-provided ad that appears on DuckDuckGo, Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile. It also does not store or share that information other than for accounting purposes.”</p></div> <p><p>  Previously, we were limited in how we could apply our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection on Microsoft tracking scripts due to a policy requirement related to our use of Bing as a source for our private search results. This is no longer the case and as of October 2022 we block Microsoft scripts from loading on 3rd-party websites in our browsing apps (MacOS, Windows, iOS, and Android) and in our browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera). To be clear, Microsoft scripts were never embedded in our search engine or apps, which do not track you. Companies insert these scripts on their own websites for their own purposes, and so they never sent any information to DuckDuckGo.</p></p> <p><p>  To evaluate whether an ad on DuckDuckGo is effective, advertisers want to know if their ad clicks turn into purchases (conversions). To see this within Microsoft Advertising, they use Microsoft scripts from the  domain. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions for their own ads that are shown on DuckDuckGo, 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not block  requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks and 1st-Party Cookie Protection will expire any cookies set by these requests on the advertiser’s website after 7 days, but these requests are blocked in all other contexts. For anyone who wants to avoid this, it’s possible to disable ads in DuckDuckGo search settings. And in any case, our other overlapping protections — including 3rd-Party Cookie Protection and Fingerprinting Protection — continue to apply, even in the context of DuckDuckGo ad clicks.</p></p> <p><p>  We’ve chosen this approach because it allows us to continue shipping best-in-class privacy protections while working to guide the advertising industry to adopt more privacy-preserving technologies. We envision a future where ad conversion detection can occur anonymously. DuckDuckGo isn’t alone in facing this issue, and the browser community has been working on private ad conversion technologies for several years now. Safari is working on <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/11529/introducing-private-click-measurement-pcm/" target="_blank"> Private Click Measurement (PCM) </a> and Firefox is working on <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/privacy-preserving-attribution-for-advertising/" target="_blank"> Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA) </a>. This work is important because it means we can improve the advertising-based business model that countless companies rely on to provide you with free services, making it more private instead of throwing it out entirely. We hope these efforts can help move the entire digital ad industry forward and make privacy online the rule rather than the exception.</p></p> <div><td>  All platforms</td><td>  All platforms support DuckDuckGo Private Search Ads.</td></div> <div><h2>  Everyday Privacy Controls</h2></div> <div><h3>  The Fire Button</h3><p>  As you visit websites, everyday data, like regular cookies and browser storage, builds up locally in the browser. We’ve made it simple to clear data like this from the DuckDuckGo app’s local storage on your device with the “Fire Button.”</p><p>  The Fire Button erases traces of websites that you’ve visited (like cookies, website caches, and favicons), browsing session information (like open tabs, back button history, and visited URLs), and permissions you’ve granted to websites (like geolocation, camera, and microphone settings). Our apps offer additional control, where you can also make specific sites partially immune to the Fire Button by “Fireproofing” them. Fireproofing a website keeps some helpful data around, like 1st-party cookies and storage that would otherwise be cleared out by the Fire Button, so you can stay signed in.</p></div> <p><p>  From DuckDuckGo app Settings, you can manage your Fireproof Sites and choose whether you’d like to automatically clear tabs and data on restart. It’s important to note that the Fire Button will not clear the following: 1st-party cookies and storage for Fireproof Sites, bookmarks, downloaded files, or DuckDuckGo Search settings. This type of protection is not offered in most popular browsers by default.</p></p> <div><td>  Firefox extension</td><td>  Unsupported</td><td>  Chrome extension</td><td>  Clears all browsing history and data.

When DuckDuckGo detects a cookie pop-up on sites you visit, we can try to automatically set your cookie preferences to instead maximize privacy and minimize cookies, then close the pop-up. For sites that don’t provide an option to manage cookie preferences, we simply try to hide the pop-up. In these cases, automatically hiding the pop-up is often still more private than selecting one of the limited options made available (e.g., “Accept All Cookies”). We currently offer coverage for approximately 80% of the top 250 websites in the UK and Germany and plan to expand coverage to additional websites over time.</p></div> <p><p>  Visit Settings in our supported apps and extensions to enable this feature.
