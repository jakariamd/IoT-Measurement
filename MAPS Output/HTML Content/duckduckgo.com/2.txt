Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser‚Äôs website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users‚Äô ad clicks.</p></p> <p><p>  Read more about this and our free Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections</p></p> <p><p>  You don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

    Starting to feel better
</h3><p>  I don‚Äôt like to be micromanaged, spied on, having my personal information sold or going to someone-some business-some political party without me knowing who it is. I recently heard about DuckDuckGo and the things they do to protect peoples privacy. I research the pros/cons and thought I‚Äôd give them a try. Within the first day of switching to them, I had several alerts. One warned me of a  social media account that was trying to get my information that was hidden on a site I clicked on (wasn‚Äôt an extension either). Another alert let me know that by clicking on the site I was about to, it would automatically gain access to sensitive info. I‚Äôm loving this browser/search engine so far due to the privacy and actual heads up it gives me when something underhanded will be going down if I click on the site. Just after two days of using it, I‚Äôm starting to feel more relaxed, in control and wanting to know more. So far I truly DO recommend this product‚Ä¶.and it‚Äôs free! Thank you DuckDuckGo! Keep up the amazing work. Hopefully we will be able to get our privacy back that has been stolen from us.</p></div> <div><span>

    DuckDuck is not a safe app to use.
</h3><p>  This app will take your information and account and sell it to any third party including terrorist and that‚Äôs what happened with me, I download that app and I write on the search key how to enable Rumble comments and I pack from the search results Rumble how to enable comment and that take me to the page and they don‚Äôt show me the clear steps and after that the terrorist who they selled to him my information and account he start to say to me F Word and threat me and he said to me that he will blow up not only me but the whole entire Neighborhoods that I am living in and he show me a map and the area that I am living in and said that he is not happy about my comments that I make on social media, then I contact apple because I get that app from apple App Store and I telled them why didn‚Äôt apple write a warning about DuckDuck private browsing because the reason why I downloaded this app because it‚Äôs on Apple app Store, they respond to me that this app is a third party app. Anyway I still disappointed apple because they didn‚Äôt mention that DuckDuck is a third party app and using that app is on my own risk and because apple always have good apps and products if apple don‚Äôt telled her customers that DuckDuck is a third party app and if they use it it‚Äôs on there owned risk, how there customers know this app is not safe.</p></div> <div><h3>
