            least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Transactions involving Third Parties. We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by
                        third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products
                        from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                        providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                        We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                        such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your

                        with that third party.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Third-Party Service Providers. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples

                        and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service
                        providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
                        may not use it for other purposes.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or
                        services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
                        business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                        Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely
                        event that Amazon.com.ca, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer
                        information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Protection of Amazon and Others. We disclose account and other personal information when we believe disclosing is
                        appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000" target="_blank"> Conditions of Use </a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users,

                        for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>   Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about
            you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
            not to share the information.</p></p> <div><h2>   How Secure Is Information About Me?</h2><p>   We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p><ul>  <li>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by

We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more

                        your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
                        we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, device identifier, or a code derived
                        from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
                        For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                        identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                        the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads
                        from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based
