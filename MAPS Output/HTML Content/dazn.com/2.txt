Our services are part-funded by the sale of advertising, or ‘ads’. You will see ads when accessing content on our services, but you can control whether and how we and our advertising technology partners use your personal information to make the ads you see more relevant to you.<b> Ad categories </b><b> Tailored: </b> These store information, or access information that is already stored, on your device, such as advertising identifiers, device identifiers, cookies and similar technologies. They enable the collection of personal information and other information (e.g. your Advertising Information) and, in combination with information independently collected by Google, enable Google and its ad technology providers to manage, deliver and measure tailored and non-tailored ads on our services, to stop you from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and to detect and stop click fraud.<b> Non-tailored:  </b>These ads are selected, displayed and measured by our ad serving partner, Google.Non-tailored ads involve Google storing and accessing information on your device (e.g. cookie / mobile identifiers) but otherwise do not use your personal information to build a profile about you and your interests in order to show you ads. To make non-tailored ads more relevant to you, we and Google use contextual information such as your general location and the type of content you view on our Services.<b> Generic: </b> These ads are pre-recorded and inserted by DAZN into the content you access and view. Unlike non-tailored ads generic ads do not involve our ad serving partner, Google, storing and accessing information on your device (e.g. cookies or other identifiers) or the use of your personal information to build a profile about you and your interests in order to show you ads. To make generic ads more relevant to you, we use contextual information such as your general location and the type of content you view on our services.<b> Delivering our ads </b>We use Google Ad Manager as our ad serving platform for tailored and non-tailored ads.  Subject to any preferences you have expressed – including consent, where required – Google will store and/or access information on your device using its Google tag, SDK or application programming interface (API) integrated with our services in order to perform the following, subject to your preferences:
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To create a tailored ads profile about you;</li><li>To select tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;</li><li>To deliver tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;</li><li>To measure ad performance of tailored and non-tailored ads on our services;</li><li>To stop you seeing the same ad repeatedly;</li><li>To detect and combat fraud and abuse.
Where legally required, we will collect your consent for the storage and/or access to information on your device, and the collection, sharing and use of personal information to select, display and/or measure tailored and non-tailored ads on our services.<b> How personal information is used for tailored ads </b>We understand the importance of transparency in relation to how we and our partner ad technology providers – including Google – use your personal information. The following is a breakdown of the personal information processing activities involved to select, display and measure tailored ads to you on our services:
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Our partner ad technology providers store and access information on your device to select, display and measure tailored ads. If you opt-out of information storage and access via Settings, you will receive only generic ads.</li><li>Subject to your preferences, our ad technology providers will use a combination of the following personal information to build a profile about you and your interests, and to select, display and measure tailored ads to you on our services:
	</li><li>We collect Advertising Information about your use of our services, which we then aggregate (or otherwise combine) with Advertising Information of other similar users and subsequently share. We do not provide any direct personal identifiers, or any attributes or behavioural characteristics of the audience segments assigned to you with our partner ad technology providers for the purpose of selecting, displaying and/or measuring tailored ads on our services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Our ad technology providers independently collect personal information on the sites you visit, your search history, the apps you use, and other information, which they may combine with the information shared by us in order to work with their own partner ad technology providers to select, display and measure tailored ads on our services. Please note that we do not control and take no responsibility for the personal information Google and other partner ad technology providers independently collect on third party sites and apps for the purposes of selecting, displaying and/or measuring tailored ads on our services.

You are always free at any time to opt-out of tailored ads as detailed in Customising your preferences, though you will still see either non-tailored ads or generic ads but they will not be as relevant to you.We have set out below how you can control the information we share, and the information Google and other partner ad technology providers independently collect in the How to control your ad preferences on our services section.<b> How personal information is used for non-tailored ads </b>Non-tailored ads use very limited personal information. We do not share personal information with Google, and Google and other partner ad technology providers do not use personal information to build a profile about you and your interests to select, display and measure ads. However, non-tailored ads do require Google to store and access information on your device to technically deliver non-tailored ads, to combat fraud and abuse, to prevent you from seeing the same ad repeatedly, and for aggregated ad reporting. If you disable this information storage and access as detailed in Customising your preferences you will receive only generic ads.<b> How to control your ad preferences on our services </b>You can control whether you receive tailored ads as detailed in Customising your preferences section. More specifically in relation to Google, to opt out or revoke consent (where applicable), you can:
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Disable information storage and access to your device by Google and other partner ad technology providers. If you disable this for Google, you will only receive generic ads on our services.</li><li>Control the inclusion of your Advertising Information within audience segments shared with Google to tailor ads on our services (as described above).</li><li>Control the personal information and other information Google independently collects and uses about you by following Google’s instructions here.
