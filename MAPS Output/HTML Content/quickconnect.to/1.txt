Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</h4><p>  These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help to measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. For example, in our remarketing or retargeting campaigns, we will serve targeted ads to you after you have visited or taken action on our website. In terms of technical execution, remarketing is the process of using a JavaScript tag to place a cookie in your browser. The cookie then informs a remarketing platform to serve specific display ads through an ad exchange, based on the pages or products you have engaged with or searched for on our website or app. This category of cookies can be disabled by changing your cookie preferences. You can also use <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2" target="_blank"> The DAA's opt-out platform </a> to decline the collection and use of information for the purpose of serving you interest-based advertising.
