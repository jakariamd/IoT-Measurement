Effective January 1, 2023</p><p>  This Privacy Statement applies to Notified and its affiliates (“Notified” “we” “us” “our”) unless the affiliate has a separately posted privacy statement. Notified values the privacy of our customers, users, and any individual who accesses or uses the Notified websites, products, and services (collectively, the “Services”). Your privacy is an important factor Notified considers in the development of each of our products and services. This Privacy Statement explains generally how we receive Personal Information about you, and what we do with that Personal Information once we have it.</p></div> <p><p>  As Notified is a global provider, the provision of the Services to users may require Personal Information to be shared with other Notified companies around the world. All Notified companies are bound by privacy statements, confidentiality and data transfer agreements as appropriate.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> What do we mean by “Personal Information”? </em></p><p>  For us, “Personal Information” means information or data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. “Sensitive Personal Information” is a subset of Personal Information and is data about children, financial information, health information (including PHI as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), Social Security or other national identification number, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, sex life, criminal convictions, and precise geolocation data.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> What type of Personal Information is collected? </em></p><p>  We may collect data, including Personal Information, about you as you use our websites, services and interact with us.

If we link other data with your Personal Information, we will treat that linked data as Personal Information. We also collect Personal Information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect Personal Information to assist us.</p></div> <p><p>  
Please understand, in addition to collecting Personal Information, Notified may also gather information that does not personally identify you regarding your use of the Notified website (“Anonymous Information”). We may use the Anonymous Information we collect regarding your use of this website to measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, for improving the Services we offer to you, or to improve the Notified website. Generally, you will not be aware when we collect such Anonymous Information. It may be collected in various ways, such as through traffic data or direct surveys of our customers and may entail the use of, among other things, cookies, IP addresses, or other numeric codes used to identify the computer or other device used to access the Notified website.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> How do we receive Personal Information about you? </em></p><p>  We learn Personal Information about you when:</p><ul>  <li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to contact us, or register on the Notified website);</li><li>we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., your use of Notified services);</li><li>someone else tells us Personal Information about you (e.g., our client provides us your Personal Information in order for us to perform services for them); or</li><li>when we try to understand more about you based on Personal Information you’ve given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).</li></ul></div> <p><p>  By providing your Personal Information, you opt-in and consent to its collection, use, disclosure, sharing, and transfer as described in this Privacy Statement.
 </p></p> <div><p>  <em> What do we do with your Personal Information once we have it? </em></p><p>  <strong> Notified does NOT sell your personal information.  </strong></p><p>  When you give us Personal Information, we will use it in the ways for which you’ve given us permission, or ways in which our clients who provided us the Personal Information instruct.

You should familiarize yourself with their statement.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> How long will we retain Personal Information? </em></p><p>  We will retain your Personal Information only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Your information will be deleted, anonymized or pseudonymized once it is no longer needed to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, or enforce our agreements. </p><p>  <em> When do we share your Personal Information with others? </em></p></div> <div><p>  We will/may share your Personal Information with others:</p><ul>  <li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li><li>When we’re required to provide it to our client from whom we received your Personal Information, or with whom you have a business relationship.</li><li>For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your Personal Information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways approved by Notified. We may use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development).</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To provide aggregate Personal Information to our business partners to make our products and services better, but when we do so, we will de-identify your Personal Information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.</li><li>To provide your Personal Information to business partners in case you purchase services of third parties from Notified (“Third Party Services”). Third Party Services are not directly controlled operated or maintained by Notified and Notified’s Privacy Statement does not apply to such Third Party Services.

We’ll notify you or our client from whom we received your Personal Information when we’re asked to hand over your Personal Information in this way unless we’re legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we’ll only release your Personal Information if we have a good faith belief the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this Statement is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections you may have to a third party’s request to disclose your Personal Information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If we have a good faith belief it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Notified or the public.</li><li>If our organizational structure or status changes (e.g., if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt), we may pass your Personal Information to a successor or affiliate.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <em> How do we protect your Personal Information? </em></p><p>  We are committed to protecting your Personal Information once we have it. We implement industry standard physical, administrative and technical security measures. If, despite these efforts, we learn of a security breach involving your Personal Information, when required by law or contractual obligations, we’ll notify you or our client so appropriate protective steps can be taken. Notified is not responsible for unauthorized access to such Personal Information by hackers or others that obtain access through illegal measures in the absence of negligence on the part of Notified.</p></div> <p><p>  You may have access to other sites through the Notified websites. These sites may have different security practices and you should familiarize yourself with those practices.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> How can you protect your Personal Information? </em></p><p>  Electronic communication (e.g., email, online chat or instant messaging, etc.) you send to us may not be secure unless we advise you in advance security measures will be in place prior to you transmitting the information. For this reason, we ask you do not send Personal Information such as financial information, health information, social security numbers or passwords to us through unsecured electronic communication. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank"> http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm </a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p></div> <p><p>  The Notified website may contain hyperlinks that can take you to websites run by third parties (“Third-Party Websites”). Any hypertext or other links to Third-Party Websites from the Notified website are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Notified website. Notified has not reviewed all of these Third-Party Websites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these websites or their content or practices. Thus, Notified does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software, or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the Third-Party Websites linked to the Notified website, you do this entirely at your own risk. Remember, this Privacy Statement only applies to Notified.

This information may include name, address, email address, IP address, phone number, login information (user name, password), marketing preferences, or payment card number. If we link other data with your Personal Information, we will treat that linked data as Personal Information. We also collect Personal Information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect Personal Information to assist us.  This information will only be used to provide services or information which you have requested.  <strong> Notified does not sell your Personal Information. </strong>  </p></div> <p><p>  We will retain your Personal Information only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law. Your information will be deleted, anonymized or pseudonymized once it is no longer needed to comply with our business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, or enforce our agreements. </p></p> <p><p>  Please see Cookies section below to understand how we use cookies.</p></p> <p><p>  Notified will not discriminate in any way against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA or any other applicable privacy law.  This includes, but is not limited to denying goods or services, change in pricing, or lower quality goods or services.  Please see “What choices do you have regarding your personal information?” and “How to Contact Us” sections below for how to exercise your rights under the CCPA and other applicable privacy laws.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> What about cookies and other tracking technology? </em></p><p>  A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded onto a device when the user accesses certain websites. Cookies can make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences for a particular website or a service. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user’s computer.</p><p>  Cookies are typically classified as either session Cookies or persistent Cookies depending on whether they expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Session Cookies – allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security when a user is accessing internet banking or to facilitate use of webmail. These session Cookies expire after a browser session, so would not be stored longer term. For this reason, session Cookies may sometimes be considered less privacy intrusive than persistent Cookies.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Persistent Cookies – are stored on a user’s device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent Cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users’ preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Notified uses cookies or other similar tracking technologies to provide you with better Services.</p></p> <p><p>  Most browsers are initially set to accept Cookies. You may configure your browser to accept all Cookies, reject all Cookies, or notify you when a Cookie is set. You can manage your own Cookies preferences by using your browser settings: each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your Cookie preferences or delete them. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse Cookies. You block Cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of all or some Cookies.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note you may browse some Notified websites without accepting Cookies from Notified; however, you may not be able to take full advantage of the functionality of the website or the Services if you do so. Other Services, particularly those which require a login and password, require Cookies and cannot be used when you have disabled Cookies in your browser.

We also use service providers whose information systems may also be in various countries. This means your Personal Information might end up in one of those information systems in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. The whole or any part of your Personal Information in connection to the Services may be processed by Notified, its affiliates and subcontractors in the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, Philippines, India, Canada, Mexico and the rest of the world, and may be transferred outside the country in which you provided the Personal Information. By giving us Personal Information, Notified may conduct such transfers of your Personal Information. No matter what country your Personal Information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this Privacy Statement. </p></p> <div><p>  <em> How do you handle my Personal Information as part of Notified’s and/or GlobeNewswire’s Media Contacts Database products and services? </em></p><p>  Certain of our Notified and GlobeNewswire services provide detailed profiles for media contacts and news outlets to public relations, media and marketing professionals, such as yourself.  If you are receiving these types of emails from Notified and/or GlobeNewswire, it is because your professional contact information is publicly available and we believe there is a legitimate interest and/or implied consent for you to be part of our media contacts database, which includes data in the public relations industry compiled by our in-house research team.  If you do not wish to be part of our media contacts database, you may unsubscribe at any time by clicking unsubscribe at the bottom of an email you have received from us.  We may use your Personal Information for purposes related to data analytics with our third party partners.  By fully unsubscribing your Personal Information will not be used this way.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Data Analytics </em></p><p>  We provide business to business communication technology services and may use your Personal Information in order to enhance and deliver data analytics, which include transforming, examining, cleansing and modelling data in order to support decision making, determining useful information and informing conclusions.  Specifically, data analytics are intended to include the following data sharing and recommendations across our various lines of business:</p><ul>  <li>Expand contact information;</li><li>Aggregation of data to identify trends and benchmarks;</li><li>Connect attendees and enhance profiles;</li><li>Provide people and content recommendations;</li><li>Drive recruitment to virtual and hybrid events;</li><li>Help to understand usage, adoption and engagement;</li><li>Increase and demonstrate return on investment of customer investments;</li><li>Assess the physical component of hybrid events; and</li><li>Give insight to customer analytics to develop new customers and expand existing customer relationships.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We make no representations or warranties on the accuracy and serviceability of your data in connection with data analytics.  Data created or existing from data analytics is intended for your use only.  Data may not be resold, reused or shared with third parties without prior written consent by Notified.  For the avoidance of doubt, by signing up to use our Services, you have freely and voluntarily given informed, explicit and unambiguous permission for Notified to process your Personal Information, including your users’ Personal Information, for data analytics.

In some circumstances, you may have the right to oppose the use or disclosure of your data or have your data deleted. You can do this by contacting us as directed in the “Contact Us” section below.</p></p> <p><p>  To correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, limit purpose of use and disclosure, delete your Personal Information, or for any other requests or questions, please contact us as directed in the “Contact Us” section below. Once we have verified your identity, we will complete the request from you or an authorized agent you have designated.  We will make all efforts to verify your identity using information we already have but may need to request additional data if we are unable to make the verification on this data alone.  If you designate an agent to make requests for you, we reserve the right to ask for proof of the agency.</p></p> <p><p>  Notified will not discriminate against any individual for exercising their privacy rights outlined above. This includes, but is not limited to; denying goods or services, change in pricing or lower quality goods or services.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> What if we change this Privacy Statement? </em></p><p>  We may need to change this Statement and our notices. Unless otherwise required, the updates will be posted online. If the changes are substantive, unless otherwise required, we will announce the update through Notified’s websites. Unless further steps are necessary related to the changes, your continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> How to Contact Us? </em></p><p>  If you require further information about privacy compliance at Notified, if you require details about our Data Protection Officer or if you want to make a correction to your Personal Information, please email us at <a href="mailto:legal@notified.com" target="_blank"> legal@notified.com </a> or mail us at:</p><p>  Notified</p><p>
