Visitors can set their browser to reject cookies altogether, to reject Innovid’s cookies in particular, or to delete cookies.

Aside from strictly necessary cookies, we will only place cookies on the browsers of EU and UK visitors subject to their consent.
</p></div> <div><h4>  Innovid’s Services</h4><p>  Innovid partners with numerous companies to provide and measure online advertisements to visitors of third party websites, mobile websites, mobile applications, connected applications, smart televisions, digital media streaming devices and other online media, and to measure the performance of advertisements across various third party linear and digital televisions, channels, platforms, and devices (collectively, “<b> Media Properties </b>”). Visitors to Media Properties are referred to herein as “<b> End Users </b>”.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Data Collected from End Users </strong>: When an End User browses or uses Media Properties that make use of the Services, Innovid may collect data about such interaction, as well as about any further interaction by such End User with the advertisements provided or measured by the Services and the Media Properties on which such Services are utilized, such as advertisements viewed, impressions, clicks and other actions taken, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, cookie ID, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, URL, referral URL, information on browser and operating system, user agent and device type. In addition, in the event that the data being collected is from a mobile device, Innovid may also collect the mobile advertising ID of the device (e.g., IDFA and Google AdID), and in the event that the data being collected is from a television with third party connected applications, a smart television, or a digital media streaming device (collectively, “<b> CTV </b>”), Innovid may also collect the advertising identifiers made available by the CTV.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Data Collected from Agencies, Brands, and other Customers of Innovid </strong>: Brands, agencies and other customers who use Innovid’s measurement services may provide or upload advertising delivery or viewership information to Innovid, including IP addresses, cookie IDs and/or advertising or device IDs, in order to enable Innovid’s provision of such measurement services to such customers. Innovid is a Processor (under GDPR) and a Service Provider (under CCPA, CPRA and similar laws) on behalf of its customers, with respect to the data described in this paragraph.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Data Collected from Third Party Sources </strong>: On occasion, Innovid may also receive data from third parties that enable advertisement optimization and/or measurement, independent of or in combination with the data collected by Innovid from End Users, such as audience interest segments, ad viewership or delivery information, television spot data, and product or media categories. It is possible that some of the data that Innovid obtains from third parties was previously associated with directly identifiable information (such as address, phone number, email and/or mailing address). However, this data goes through a de-identification process before it is shared with Innovid, such that by the time it reaches Innovid, it no longer contains directly identifiable information.</p></p> <p><p>  The data collected by Innovid and/or received from third parties may be shared and used to provide information, analytics and reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Services, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Services and perform internal analysis, and to help Innovid display, optimize, target, sequence and/or customize advertisements to the inferred interests or preferences of End Users. Innovid may use certain general health-related segments received from third parties in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in such topics, such as general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, beauty, and fitness. Such health-related segments do not include sensitive health information (such as an End User having a certain medical condition like heart disease or arthritis).</p></p> <p><p>  From time to time, advertisements served by Innovid contain functionality that enables an End User to enter personal data into such advertisements or into the landing page to which such advertisements are linked, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding an advertiser or publisher’s product, service, program or other offer. In the event that an End User elects to provide personal data under such circumstances, Innovid stores such information and shares it with the advertiser, agency, or publisher on behalf of whom the advertisement was served, and/or with such entity’s service provider. Innovid may use such information to fulfill or aid in the fulfillment of the End User’s request and/or to auto-populate future requests by the End User’s device. In cases where the advertisement contains functionality enabling Innovid to store personal data, the End User will have the option to opt-out of the storage of such information by indicating their preference in the appropriate checkbox shown in the advertisement, or by clicking through to the settings available through the advertisement. The End User should review the advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy to understand how such entity will process any personal data entered by the End User or captured. In order to exercise End User’s rights to delete, access, rectify or move personal data, the End User must contact the controller (our customer). In some cases we are able to support exercise of these rights. If you have any other questions or requests with respect to privacy, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@innovid.com" target="_blank"> privacy@innovid.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Innovid works with Nielsen to better understand the reach of ad campaigns.

</p></p> <div><h4>  Cross-Device Tracking</h4><p>  Innovid may, or may use the services of third party companies to, establish connections between a user’s devices and to provide interest-based advertising across devices and to measure the performance of advertising across devices. Cross-device connections allow Innovid to understand that a single user is accessing advertisements served or measured by Innovid from multiple devices, and to synchronize or target advertising messages and/or measure the performance of advertisements across those devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit the NAI Choices page located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank"> http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ </a> to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android (see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices" target="_blank"> http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices/ </a>), or visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices page located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice" target="_blank"> http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice </a>, to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.

Innovid will attempt to set such opt-out cookie for 5 years; however, the End User’s browser may impose a shorter timespan. If the browser causes the opt-out cookie to expire, or if an End User deletes its cookies or changes computers or devices after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by clicking the link in this paragraph. Please note that where an End User blocks cookies on his or her browser, Innovid will be unable to set an opt-out cookie, and therefore unable to abide by such End User opt-out request.</p></div> <div><h5>  Opt-out for Mobile Applications:</h5><p>  To opt-out of interest-based advertising for the mobile applications on your current device, the method of opting out depends on the type of device you have. Please also note that, in some cases (i.e., if you have an older device), it may be necessary for you to provide your device ID in order to opt out.</p><p>  Opting out on Apple iOS devices: On iOS 12.4 go to Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Limit Ad Tracking. On iOS 7.0 through 12.3, you can go to Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising and set the “Limit Ad Tracking” function to ‘ON’.

Please note, however, that these advertisements may be less relevant to such End User’s interests.</p></p> <div><h5>  Opt Out of InnovidXP Measurement Services:</h5><p>  The advertiser, as the owner or manager of its website and applications, is responsible for informing its end users about all data being collected (including by Innovid) and for collecting appropriate consents from End Users, in accordance with applicable data and privacy laws.</p><p>  InnovidXP has implemented an opt-out mechanism (<a href="http://collector.tvsquared.com/optout.php" target="_blank"> http://collector.tvsquared.com/optout.php </a>) which the advertiser can make available to its End Users. The opt-out applies solely to the InnovidXP cookie placed on an End User’s browser or operating system when the End User visited the advertiser’s website or application. This mechanism will not opt an End User out of all InnovidXP cookies. If an End User visits another advertiser’s website or application, and that advertiser is using InnovidXP attribution services, the End User will receive other InnovidXP cookies specific to that advertiser (and which cookies the End User would need to disable also). End Users may also wish to manage their cookies on a wider basis through their browser or operating system settings on their computer or device. They can find out instructions on how to do this through the browser or operating system they are using.</p></div> <p><p>  The Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/" target="_blank"> www.digitaladvertisingalliance.org/ </a>) and Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="https://thenai.org" target="_blank"> www.nai.org </a>) also provides helpful resources for end users in relation to opting out of interest-based ads, re-setting advertising IDs, and limiting ad tracking.

</p></p> <div><h4>  Additional Privacy Information For Residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, And Nevada</h4><p>  In this section, we provide information for residents of California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Nevada, as may be required under applicable privacy laws of such states from time to time (“State Privacy Laws”). For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), require that we provide their respective residents certain specific information about how we handle their personal information.</p></div> <p><p>  Under State Privacy Laws, subject to certain exceptions, “personal information” is generally any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular resident or household in the applicable state. Because certain State Privacy Laws require that we disclose specific information about how we handle certain personal information collected about residents of their states, the scope of this section may be different than the scope of our privacy policy.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that for Innovid employee information-related requests, the Innovid employee privacy policy (which is separately provided to Innovid employees) applies.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> What is a “sale of personal information” under State Privacy Laws such as CCPA and VCDPA? </em></p><p>  A sale may occur any time a business sells or makes available any personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.

Innovid acts as a service provider to its customers and does not engage in sharing of personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> What is “sensitive information” under State Privacy Laws? </em></p><p>  “Sensitive information” is generally defined as personal information that reveals sensitive information about a consumer, such as social security, driver’s license, state identification card or passport numbers, account log-in, financial account, debit card or credit card numbers in combination with any required security or access code, password or credentials allowing access to an account, precise geolocation, data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, physical or mental health diagnosis, sexual orientation, or citizen or immigrant status, as well as processing of genetic or biometric data for identification, and personal data collected from a known child. Innovid does not collect information we believe to be sensitive under applicable law.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Categories of Personal Information that We Collect and Disclose to Others for a Business Purpose </strong></p><p>  The items below set out generally the categories of personal information that we collect and disclose to others for a business purpose.</p><p>  We collect these categories of personal information from the sources described in our privacy policy above, and for the purposes described in our privacy policy above.
