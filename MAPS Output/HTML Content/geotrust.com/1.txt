When you communicate with us, we will attempt to associate the method and substance of the communication with your account. When you <a href="https://www.digicert.com/contact-us" target="_blank"> Contact Us </a> via telephone, we record the communication for quality assurance and training purposes.

Marketing: </b> We will use your information as it is in our legitimate interests to send out promotional emails (subject to seeking your consent where required by applicable law). These emails include beacons that communicate information about the email back to DigiCert. Such tracking allows DigiCert to gauge the effectiveness of its advertising and marketing campaigns. Recipients can opt-out of receiving promotional communications from DigiCert by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each email or by using our <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8805d472-8993-4a56-a4d1-9c1ba8b92aca/f3fe7561-71f8-4f11-b648-8fb5955dd5ef" target="_blank"> Privacy Request Form </a>.

Validation Services: </b> DigiCert uses information provided by Customers to perform Validation Services, in accordance with Industry Standards.

Advisory e-mails: </b> While a Customer account is active, DigiCert will send advisory e-mails to Customers to provide support and security updates in relation to our products and services, as this is necessary for the performance of our contracts with Customers. Advisory emails are used to respond to inquiries, provide support and validation services, provide upgrade information and security updates, inform customers about expiring Certificates, and inform the Customer about ordered products and services.
