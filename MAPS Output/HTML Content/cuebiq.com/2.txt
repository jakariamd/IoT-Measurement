We’ve built our privacy framework around four key principles:</span></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Consent </b></li><li><b> Transparency </b></li><li><b> Control </b></li><li><b> Accountability </b></li></ul><p>  To learn more about these principles and our privacy framework, please explore this Privacy Center.

It means that we always <b> ask </b></span><span>   for you to share your location before collecting it – that’s it.</span><p>  We only process data from devices who opted in to share their location.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Please see below for a few examples from some of our mobile app partners. </strong></p></p> <div><h1>  Transparency</h1><p>  <b> Transparency:  </b></p><span>  Because we believe in open and honest communication, Cuebiq requires all App partners to disclose their relationship with Cuebiq, directly or by category, in their Privacy Policy. </span><span>  In those privacy policies, you can easily find clear and transparent descriptions of what information is being collected and how it is being used. You can also find what options you have when it comes to opting out of sharing your location data.</span></div> <p><p>  In order to be as transparent as possible, we wanted to share with you a few examples of how we use location data.
