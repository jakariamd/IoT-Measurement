Email  pixels  provide  insight  to  tell  us  things  like whether  you  opened  the  email,  how  many  times  and  the  device  you  used, helping to inform our marketing strategies. The email pixel sits within the email communication, but it stores nothing on your device. If you delete the email this will also delete the pixel.</p></div> <div><h2>   How to turn off the application of email pixels </h2><p>  You can turn off the application of email pixels by closing the email before you download any images or click on any links. Many mailbox providers allow you to block the loading of images containing pixels in any emails received and you can adjust the settings in your mobile or web app to enable this. Many mobile and desktop devices will also allow you to adjust the settings on the device to block the loading of images containing pixels. We do not control these third-party settings and are not responsible for the privacy policies of these third-party organisations. Please refer to their policies if you want to learn more about these settings.</p></div> <div><h2>   More cookie info: </h2><ul>  <li>Information Commissioner's Office</li><li>Trade body for online advertisers </li><li>Detailed information about cookies</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  Popular Links</h2><small>  ©2023 Virgin Media</small><span>  All Rights Reserved</span></div> <div><h2>  Your Cookies</h2><p>  We use cookies to give you the best browsing experience, to create content, ads and offers personalised to you and to analyse our website use.
