</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Miscellaneous
</li><li>
<strong> Modification of Agreement. </strong> Apple reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of the Agreement at any time and to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Site or Programs (or any part thereof), either temporarily or permanently, at any time without prior notice to you. Any changes to the Agreement shall prevail over the terms accepted upon your first access of the Site. You acknowledge and agree that your continued use of
									the Site or Programs after the Agreement has changed constitutes your acceptance of the Agreement as revised. Apple will notify you of material changes by posting the change on the Site and requiring you to reaccept the Agreement. Such changes will be effective immediately upon posting. You acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of the Programs.
								</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Force Majeure. </strong>
									Neither party will be liable to the other party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the control and without negligence of the parties. Such events, occurrences, or causes will include, without limitation, acts of God, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, earthquakes, and fire and explosions, but the
									inability to meet financial obligations is expressly excluded.
								</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Waiver. </strong>
									Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party’s rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect, or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time will not be construed as a waiver of such party’s rights under this Agreement, and it will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party’s right to take subsequent
									action. No exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will preclude the enforcement by such party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such party is entitled by law to enforce.
								</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Limitation of Liability. </strong>
</li><li>You understand and agree that the Site and Programs are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and that Apple does not make any specific commitments or warranties, guarantees, or conditions about the Site and/or Programs.</li><li>Except where prohibited by law, in no event will Apple be liable to you for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, or punitive damages, or for any lost profits, even if Apple has been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses. This includes if and/or when Apple deletes your Content, information, or account.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, Apple is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss that arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or your participation in the Programs, Apple liability shall in no event exceed the greater of US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</li><li>Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude either party’s liability for (i) fraud; (ii) death or personal injury caused by its negligence; (iii) any breach of any implied term that Apple has title to the Site and Programs, or any analogous laws under applicable law; and (iv) any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. </strong>
									In the event of any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any
									right or remedy available to them under applicable law. You agree that in that event, all disputes will be resolved in the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California; agree to the personal jurisdiction of that venue; and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply to the extent that you are a consumer based in the European Union. To the extent that you are a consumer based in the European Union, you
									may make a claim in the courts of the country or region where you reside. Any claim under this Agreement must be brought within three (3) years after the cause of action arises or such claim or cause may be deemed barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to
									costs and attorney fees.
								</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Severability. </strong>
									If any provision or part-provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, it shall be deemed deleted, but that shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this Agreement.
								</li><li>
<strong> Choice of Language (Canada) </strong>
									The parties to this Agreement confirm that it is their express wish that this Agreement and all other documents, terms, conditions, policies, and notices relating hereto have been and shall be drawn up in the English language only.
