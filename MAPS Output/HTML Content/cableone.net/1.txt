We may also collect additional personally identifiable information if you respond to a voluntary customer survey or enter a sweepstakes or contest offered through a Sparklight website, or if you request changes to your service through one of our customer service representatives.

Sparklight reserves the right to monitor bandwidth, usage, and content from time to time to operate our services; to identify violations of our polices; and/or to protect the network and Sparklight users. Sparklight will at all times comply with applicable laws, such as copyright law, and cooperate with law enforcement authorities and system administrators at other Internet service providers or other network or computing facilities. Such compliance and cooperation may include Sparklight providing the username, IP address, or other personally identifiable information about a website user or services subscriber. </p></p> <div><h3>  LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3><p>  Sparklight will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your permission except:  for purposes related the reason the information was collected, such as a credit check or provision of requested services or equipment; to respond to proper requests for information from government or judicial officials investigating illegal activity; in the event of bankruptcy or a sale of substantially all or some of the assets of Sparklight; to protect the personal safety of our subscribers or the public; to improve or expand usage of our services and offerings to you and other users or potential users of services; to protect and defend the rights or property of Sparklight, our subscribers, other internet users, and the functioning of our network; or to comply with the law. Sparklight may share your personally identifiable information with entities affiliated with us through common ownership or control or with third parties assisting us who agree not to further share or disclose the information and only to use it for the purposes we are permitted by this agreement. </p></div> <div><h3>  RETENTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3><p>  We plan to store personally identifiable information about you only so long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with laws governing our business. This period of time could be as long as seven years for our tax and accounting needs. Thereafter we will take reasonable steps to destroy such information, unless there are legitimate pending requests for access to such information.</p></div> <div><h3>  SECURITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3><p>  The security of your personally identifiable information is a high priority. While no website or service provider can guarantee complete security, we employ security technologies and procedures to help protect the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and our actions will be consistent with current technologies, industry practices, and legal requirements, all on a reasonable best-efforts basis.</p></div> <div><h3>  CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3><p>  This website is intended for use by residents of the United States who are over 18 years of age and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under thirteen years of age. Should a child whom we know to be under thirteen send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information. Parents and guardians are solely responsible to monitor and regulate their children’s’ usage of our websites and services. </p></div> <div><h3>  THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h3><p>  There are locations throughout our website where you may accept a link to third-party websites that do not operate under our privacy policy. When you click through to these websites, our privacy policies and practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of all third-party websites before engaging in any transactions with them to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information.</p></div> <div><h3>  CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3><p>  We may modify or update our services from time to time, including the provisions of this privacy policy . In the case of material changes, we will post changes to our privacy policy here for a period of time before such changes become effective, so you should review this policy frequently.</p></div> <div><h3>  CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION (“CPNI”)</h3><p>  Another aspect of Sparklight’s privacy policy relates exclusively to information related to any telephone services you purchase from us. Federal FCC regulations require that a company providing telephone services protect certain information, known as “Customer Proprietary Network Information” or “CPNI”, such as the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, charges, and amount of a service used by customers. It does not include names, addresses, or telephone numbers (unless unlisted) because such information is generally publicly available.</p></div> <p><p>  In order to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI, we do not use or disclose it to anyone except with your consent or as permitted by the FCC regulations. In order to effectively protect your CPNI, we may need to authenticate you are our telephone customer before we can discuss details of your account that involve CPNI. In person we may ask you provide a photo ID and over the phone we may ask for the password on your account. If you do not have a password, we may only be able to send communications containing CPNI to your customer address of record or by calling the telephone number of record. When your password, address, or certain other information is changed, we will notify you.  If you did not make or authorize the changes in the notice, you should contact us immediately. </p></p> <p><p>  We will use your CPNI as reasonably necessary to provide you with our telephone services and support such as maintenance and billing for your phone service. We may also disclose your CPNI in response to a proper legal demand for the information and to protect Sparklight, its customers or other parties against fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of its services. FCC regulations allow certain expanded uses of your CPNI on either an “opt-in” or “opt-out” authorization basis. If we decide to seek such authorization we will first give you an oral or written notice that will explain the proposed use, how you can respond, and what will happen if you do not respond.  </p></p> <div><h3>  DO NOT CALL POLICY</h3><p>  As part of its general business practice and in compliance with laws and regulations governing telemarketing and consumers’ rights to privacy, it is the policy of Sparklight that outbound sales calls will not be made to any person who has communicated a desire to us not to receive telephone solicitations or to any person on a state or federal Do Not Call list, except as permitted by law. The company reserves the right to make telephone solicitations in the absence of notification.</p></div> <p><p>  You may contact your local Sparklight office by phone or in writing to be added to our Do Not Call list. Whether you call or write, you must specifically request to be placed on Sparklight’s Do Not Call list and provide your name, address and all telephone number(s) you wish to be included. Your number will be placed on our Do Not Call list within five (5) days of receipt. If you obtain a new telephone number, you must give us that new number if you want your “do not call” status to remain in effect. Please note that the law permits Sparklight to contact its customers for non-solicitation purposes, such as surveys, billing issues, or service-related matters.</p></p> <div><h3>  CONTACT US</h3><p>  If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or any other services we provide, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@cableone.biz" target="_blank"> legal@cableone.biz </a> or 210 E.
