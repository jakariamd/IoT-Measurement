use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Services,

Podomatic uses third party service providers to perform functions on its behalf. Examples include credit card processing,
email service providers, analyzing data and providing customer service. These service providers may receive access to
personally identifiable information needed to perform such functions on our behalf and are only authorized to use your
personally identifiable information as necessary to provide these services to us.

</p></p> <p><p>  
In connection with the Services, we may also partner with third parties to give you the ability to make your
User Contributions available on their audio podcast platforms (e.g., Pandora, Google Podcasts, Spotify,
Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, Audible, Deezer, etc.). By choosing to make your User Contributions available on
such third party platforms, you consent to Podomatic’s disclosure and sharing of your User Contributions and
any other information required to such third-parties on your behalf, including your personally
identifiable information. Such third parties’ use of your personally identifiable information
is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections
as protective as this Privacy Policy.

</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>
Information Security
</li></ul><p>  
We store all user information in secure databases protected by a variety of industry-standard access controls.
For example, we use secure passwords, SSL encryption, disk-based encryption, firewalls, and other measures to
help us protect your information. However, no company, including Podomatic, can fully eliminate security risks
associated with the transmission of personally identifiable information through online transactions, and you
do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures
contained on or within the Services.

</p></div> <p><p>  
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have
chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping that password
confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

</h4><p>  
We partner with third parties to either display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising
on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information
about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon
your browsing activities and interests. If you do not wish to allow the use of cookies, you can
set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
If you disable or refuse cookies, some parts of the Services may then be inaccessible or not function properly.

</p></div> <p><p>  
We do not control third parties’ collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising.
However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected
or used in this way. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you
interest-based ads, you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from members of the
Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) on the NAI’s website by clicking

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information.
This Section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.

</p><p>  
You have the right to request that we disclose to you certain information about our collection and use of your
personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request
(discussed <a href="#exercising-your-request" target="_blank"> below </a>),
we will disclose to you:

</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>the categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li><li>the categories of sources for the personal information we have collected about you;</li><li>our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;</li><li>the categories of third parties with whom we sell or share that personal information;</li><li>the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you (also called a data portability request); and</li><li>
if we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
(i) sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
(ii) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories
that each category of recipient obtained.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
You also have the right to request that Podomatic delete any of your personal information that we have collected
from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request
(discussed <a href="#exercising-your-request" target="_blank"> below </a>),
we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal
information from our records, unless an exception applies.

</p></p> <div><p>  
Podomatic may deny your request to delete your personal information if it is necessary for us or our service
providers to maintain your personal information in order to:

</p><ul>  <li>
complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, provide a good
or service requested by you, or reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing
business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract between the Podomatic and you;
</li><li>
detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity;
or prosecute those responsible for that activity;
</li><li>
debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise his or her right of free speech,
or exercise another right provided for by law;
</li><li>
comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter
3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code;
</li><li>
engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest
that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when our deletion of the information
is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research,
if the consumer has provided informed consent;
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with your expectations based on your relationship with Podomatic;
</li><li>
to comply with a legal obligation; or
</li><li>
otherwise use your personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible
with the context in which you provided the information.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
To exercise the access, data portability and deletion rights described above,
please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>logging into your user account and submitting a request.</li><li>calling us at 415-975-9981.</li><li>emailing us at <a href="mailto:legal@podomatic.com" target="_blank"> legal@podomatic.com </a> with the subject line heading of “CCPA Consumer Privacy Request.”</li><li>
sending us a request by regular mail to:
Podomatic, Inc.
Attn: Legal Department
10 Cleveland Street
San Francisco, CA 94103

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
related to your personal information. To designate an authorized agent, please provide such
authorized individual with signed permission to do so. An agent’s failure to provide evidence
of authorization may result in our denial of the request.

</p></p> <p><p>  
You may only make a verifiable request for access to your personal information twice within a 12-month period.
The verifiable consumer request must:

</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we have
collected personal information or an authorized agent, which may include providing the email address
we have on file for you, and referencing a non-public detail that is included in your user profile
that we may use to verify your identity;
</li><li>
and
</li><li>
describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity
or the authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

</p></p> <p><p>  
Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However,
we do consider requests made through your password-protected account sufficiently verified when the
request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.

</p></p> <p><p>  
We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify
the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request. Once we receive a verifiable consumer
request from you, we will confirm receipt within 10 days and we endeavor to respond to you within 45 days
of receiving the verifiable consumer request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason
and extension period in writing.

</p></p> <p><p>  
Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the verifiable
consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
another entity without hindrance.

</p></p> <p><p>  
We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you
why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

</p></p> <p><p>  
We do not sell your personal information. However, we want to make sure that you are aware of all of your
consumer rights under the CCPA, which includes the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.
Under the CCPA, if you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct a business, at any time,
not to sell your personal information (the “right to opt-out”). If you are under the age of 16, you
(or your parent or guardian if you are 13 years or younger) are required to provide affirmative
authorization (the “right to opt-in”) to the sale of your personal information. Consumers
who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.

</p></p> <p><p>  
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your California Consumer Privacy Act rights.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
deny you goods or services;
</li><li>
charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts
or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
</li><li>
provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or
</li><li>
suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level
or quality of goods or services.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result
in different prices, rates or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer
will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms
that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program
requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>
European Residents
</li></ul><p>  
Podomatic, Inc. recognizes that the European Economic Area (“EEA”) has established strict protections
regarding the handling of certain personally identifiable information that we may receive from visitors
to or users of the Services in the EEA, including requirements to provide adequate protection of such
information outside of the EEA. Where we collect personally identifiable information relating to
individuals in the EEA, it will be transferred to our servers within the United States.

</p></div> <div><h4>  Your data protection rights
</h4><p>  
Under European data protection law, in certain circumstances, you may have the following rights:

</p><ul>  <li>
the right to request access to any personally identifiable information that we hold about you
as well as related information, including the purposes for processing the information, the
recipients or categories of recipients with whom the information has been shared, where possible,
the period for which the information will be stored, the source of the information, and the
existence of any automated decision making;
</li><li>
the right to obtain without undue delay the rectification of any inaccurate personally
identifiable information that we hold about you;
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
the right to request that personally identifiable information held about you be deleted;
</li><li>
the right to prevent or restrict processing of your personally identifiable information; and
</li><li>
the right to request the transfer of personally identifiable information directly to a
third party where this is technically feasible.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
Where the processing of your personally identifiable information is based on your previously given consent,
you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You may also have the right to object to the
processing of your personally identifiable information on grounds relating to your particular situation.

</p></p> <p><p>  
We will collect, use and share personally identifiable information in the same manner and for the same
purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy.

</p></p> <div><h4>  Exercising your data protection rights
</h4><p>  
In order to exercise your data protection rights, please contact Podomatic as described in the Contact Us
section <a href="#contact-us" target="_blank"> below </a>. Podomatic takes each request seriously and will comply with your request to the extent required
by applicable law. For your protection, we may need to verify your identity before responding to your request,
such as verifying that the email address from which you send the request matches your email address that
we have on file.

</p></div> <p><p>  
We will not be able to respond to a request if we no longer hold your personally identifiable information.
If you feel that you have not received a satisfactory response from us, you may consult with the data
protection authority in your country.

</p></p> <div><h4>  Governing Law
</h4><p>  
By choosing to visit or use the Services, or provide information to us, you agree that any dispute over
privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the laws of the State of
California and the United States of America. You also agree to abide by any dispute resolution mechanisms or
limitations on damages contained in our Terms of Service, or other agreements that we have with you.

</p><ul>  <li>
Changes in this Privacy Policy
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. The date this
Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. If we decide to make any changes to our
Privacy Policy, we will notify you of those changes by posting on the Websites and other places we deem
appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances,
if any, we disclose it.

</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>
Children Under 13
</li></ul><p>  
Our Websites and Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age. Still, we recognize that children
may gain access to our Website and Services, so it is possible that we may collect personally identifiable
information from children in connection with such access. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
and its rules (collectively, “COPPA”) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this
section, “parents”) about our practices for collecting, using and disclosing personal information
from children under a certain age (each a “child,” collectively “children”).

</p></div> <p><p>  
Certain content and features are only accessible by registered users and we endeavor to limit our collection,
use and disclosure of personally identifiable information to that of our registered users. However, anyone
(including children) can access any of the publicly available parts of our Websites and Services and
any public content without providing us with their personally identifiable information.

</p></p> <p><p>  
Further, we have taken certain measures to prevent children from registering on the Websites and Services and,
except in connection with those measures, we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose the
personally identifiable information from children under 13. For example, we request that each
person seeking to register for an account provide us with information used to determine
that person’s age. If a potential registrant is identified as being a child, or we learn that
we have collected or received personal information from a child without verification of
parental consent, we will delete that child’s information.

</p></p> <p><p>  
We also use certain technologies, such as cookies, to automatically collect information from our
unregistered users (including children) when they visit or use the Websites and Services.
However, such information may be considered “personal information” under COPPA but
it is collected only to support our internal operations. Specifically, we use cookies
to recognize a child that has been unable to register for an account, for the sole purpose of
preventing him or her from circumventing our age verification procedures.

</p></p> <p><p>  
If you are under 13, do not, without parental consent, use or provide any information on the Websites,
or through any of their features, register for an account for the Services or provide any information
about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any username
you may use. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please
contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@podomatic.com" target="_blank"> legal@podomatic.com </a>.
