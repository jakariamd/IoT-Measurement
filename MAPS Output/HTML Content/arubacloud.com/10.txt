The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.</p><p>  <strong> Do we use cookies? </strong></p><p>  Yes, for more information see our <a href="https://www.bidswitch.com/cookie-statement" target="_blank"> Cookie Statement </a></p></div> <p><p>  To opt-out from our cookie(s), please click <a href="https://x.bidswitch.net/opt-out" target="_blank"> this link </a>.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Do we disclose any information to third parties? </strong></p><p>  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personal data. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others rights, property, or safety. We may provide visitor information to third parties for marketing, advertising or other uses.</p></div> <div><p>  We may disclose your personal data to the following categories of third parties:</p><ul>  <li>to our group companies, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website), or who otherwise process personal data for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that you are notified of at the time we collect your personal data.</li><li>to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>to an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal data only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice;</li><li>to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> International data transfers </strong></p><p>  Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p><p>  Specifically, some of our website servers are located in the USA and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal data we may process it in any of these countries.</p></div> <p><p>  However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. For any transfers out of the EEA, we will put in place appropriate safeguards in accordance with European law, such as executing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect the personal data that they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Data retention </strong></p><p>  We retain personal data we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Third-party links </strong></p><p>  Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.
