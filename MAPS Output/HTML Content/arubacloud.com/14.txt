AddThis Privacy Policy</h2></div> <div><h3>  1. INTRODUCTION</h3><p>  <em> AddThis services have been terminated as of May 31, 2023. Please visit  </em><a href="https://www.addthis.com/" target="_blank"> addthis.com </a><em>  for more information. </em></p><p>  This AddThis Privacy Policy (also referred to as the “<strong> Privacy Policy </strong>”) informs consumers about the collection, use, sharing, and selling (collectively referred to as “<strong> processing </strong>” or “<strong> process </strong>”) of your personal information in connection with Oracle’s provision of the AddThis Tools. It also explains the privacy rights you have in relation to these processing activities.</p></div> <p><p>  Oracle (“<strong> Oracle </strong>”, “<strong> we </strong>”, “<strong> us </strong>”, “<strong> Oracle Advertising </strong>”) provides an AddThis suite of technologies to publishers for use on their websites (“<strong> AddThis Tools </strong>”). AddThis Tools provide website owners with the capability to enable users of their websites to share webpages, blogs, news, photos, videos, and other content with social networks and other destinations via a browser plug-in or website plug-in. With AddThis Tools, publishers can (i) enable users to share, follow, view, recommend and interact with the publisher’s content, and (ii) collect information from those users as a result of their visit. The AddThis Tools are available for download through AddThis.com or through selected third party sites.</p></p> <p><p>  When you interact with a website on which a publisher has installed AddThis Tools, your direct interactions are primarily with that publisher as a data controller. In our AddThis Terms of Service with the publisher, we require that the publisher informs you directly of how it collects and uses your personal information in this context, and gets your consent where appropriate. Oracle may then also receive information about you via your interactions with the publisher’s AddThis Tools, so this Privacy Policy informs you how we process that personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy was last updated on December 16, 2022. However, the Privacy Policy can change over time, for example to meet changing business or legal requirements. The most up-to-date version can be found on this <a href="/legal/privacy/addthis-privacy-policy.html" target="_blank"> website </a>. In case there is an important change that we want to highlight to you, we will also inform you in another appropriate way (for example, via a pop-up notice or statement of changes on our website).</p></p> <div><h4>  SCOPE OF THE PRIVACY POLICY</h4><span>  See

SCOPE</h3><p>  As described above, this Privacy Policy applies to information received by Oracle via AddThis Tools installed on a publisher’s website (“<strong> Publisher Site </strong>”). “<strong> Publisher </strong>” means the owner or operator of a Publisher Site that incorporates and displays the AddThis Tools and makes the AddThis Tools available to you.</p><p>  Oracle also provides publishers with a platform where they can perform analytics and customize their websites and/or applications to provide users with more relevant advertising (“<strong> AddThis Platform </strong>”). This Privacy Policy does not govern the use of the AddThis Platform by the Publisher (or any individual working for the Publisher). In addition, this Privacy Policy does not apply to personal information Oracle collects from Publishers on www.addthis.com (“<strong> AddThis Site </strong>”) in order to register and administer a Publisher’s account on the AddThis Site and provide the Publisher with access to the AddThis Platform. Oracle’s Privacy Policy on <a href="/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank"> https://www.oracle.com/legal/privacy/privacy-policy.html </a> describes how we process such Publisher personal information.</p></div> <div><h3>  3. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3><p>  Oracle America Inc., is responsible for processing AddThis Data described in this Privacy Policy.</p></div> <div><h3>  4. WHICH CATEGORIES AND SPECIFIC PIECES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE PROCESS AND FROM WHAT SOURCES?</h3><p>  The AddThis Tools collect information from the device used by you to interact with Publisher Sites (“<strong> AddThis Data </strong>”). Note that the AddThis Tools only collect limited information from users  located in the EU/EEA, Switzerland or the UK (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Europe”) and only for legal compliance and data minimization purposes (i.e., to prevent ingestion of information from users in Europe for commercial purposes) as described below in Section 5 of this Policy.</p></div> <p><p>  AddThis Data is collected online and may indirectly identify you. It includes, for example:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>unique IDs such as a cookie ID on your browser;</li><li>IP addresses and information derived from IP addresses, such as geographic location;</li><li>information about your device, such as browser, device type, operating system, the presence or use of ‘apps’, screen resolution, or the preferred language;</li><li>the date and time you visited a Publisher Site; and</li><li>the referring URL and the web search you used to locate and navigate to a Publisher Site.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For personal information collected outside Europe, we may associate such information with interest segments or profiles as part of the provision of AddThis services to our customers and partners. “<strong> Interest segments </strong>” are a specific group of consumers that share a common behavior or preference used for marketing by our customers. “<strong> Profiles </strong>” are a set of attributes about a specific consumer or device, or a set of multiple consumers or devices sharing common attributes used for marketing by our customers.</p></p> <p><p>  Oracle may also collect email addresses on behalf of a Publisher to assist the Publisher in creating email lists as part of our AddThis List Building Tools service. Oracle is not responsible for the use and processing of your email address in connection with the AddThis List Building Tools service. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the Publishers to understand how such Publishers use and share your email addresses.</p></p> <div><h3>  5. FOR  WHAT COMMERCIAL OR BUSINESS PURPOSE DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3><p>  For personal information collected outside Europe, we use personal information for the following commercial purposes:</p><p>  a) to enable AddThis Tools functionality;</p><p>  b) to enable AddThis Publishers and Oracle Advertising customers and partners to market products and services to you;</p><p>  c) to provide personalized recommendations and messages;</p><p>  d) to link browsers and apps across devices;</p></div> <div><p>  e) to sync unique identifiers; and</p><p>  f) to analyze, develop, and improve the AddThis Tools and Oracle products and services.</p><p>  For personal information collected outside Europe, we use personal information for the following business purposes:</p><p>  g) to manage the security of our sites, networks, and systems; and</p><p>  h) to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business.</p><p>  These purposes are further specified below.</p><p>  Please note that with respect to Europe, AddThis collects only limited information from users located in Europe and other regions solely to comply with applicable laws and regulations by deleting information about these users for the legitimate interests of preventing the ingestion of personal information from users in Europe and other regions for commercial purposes. These users in Europe can still avail themselves of the AddThis functionality but AddThis Data will not be collected from such users and used for Oracle’s own commercial purposes.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> a) Enable AddThis Tools functionality. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We use AddThis Data to process your request to share content via the AddThis Tools. We also use AddThis Data to customize the AddThis Tools to your usage patterns.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Example: You visit a website and use the AddThis sharing tool on the website to share an article to Facebook. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> b) Enable AddThis Publishers and Oracle Advertising customers and partners to market products and services to you. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Publishers provide us with AddThis Data so that we can build Segments and Profiles to facilitate personalized interest-based advertising for you by Oracle and our Oracle Marketing & Data Cloud customers and partners.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Example: A marketing professional working for a travel company wants to reach a group of individuals (also known as an audience) who may be interested in its travel specials to Hawaii. The marketing professional uses AddThis Tools to create an audience interested in travel to Hawaii. If you have visited a travel website previously and have expressed an interest in Hawaiian vacations, you may subsequently see advertisements for a vacation to Hawaii because a cookie has been placed on your device that made you part of that travel company’s audience. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> c) Provide personalized recommendations and messages. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Publishers can use AddThis Data and insights provided by AddThis to personalize the Publisher Site.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Example: You visit a site and see content on the site that you find relevant to your interests. Using the example above, if you visit the travel company’s site, you may see specials to Hawaii on the travel company’s homepage. You decide you want to receive additional information from the travel company via email communications and provide your email address to the travel company so they can send you offers and specials directly to your inbox. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> d) Link browsers and apps across devices. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  For linking Profiles and Segments to enable Oracle Advertising customers and partners to connect your interest segments across the various browsers and/or devices you may use for the purposes described in this section.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Example: You are interested in vacations offered by a travel company and have clicked on their online advertising. You are logged into several devices (your desktop, smartphone, and tablet) using the same login. Oracle partners have indicated that you are likely the same user across those same devices. The travel company is able to send vacation offers to you (via de-identified cookie ID) to these different devices. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> e) Sync unique identifiers. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The AddThis Tools also incorporate Cookies and Pixels from Oracle partners to enable the synchronization of unique identifiers between Oracle and our third party partners to facilitate online behavioral advertising across the online advertising ecosystem. For a list of those third party partners, please visit: http://www.addthis.com/privacy/pixel-partners. The ‘Opt-Out’ tool available below will opt you out of data collection by Oracle and cease the syncing of unique identifiers with our third party partners. Please see the “<strong> What are your choices? </strong>” section below for more information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> f) To analyze, develop, improve, and improve the AddThis Tools and Oracle products and services. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We can process AddThis Data for Oracle’s own research and development purposes. For example, to enhance data quality, develop new features and functionality and for statistical analyses related to the performance and operation of Oracle Advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> g) To manage the security of our sites, networks, and systems. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We can collect usage and systems operations data from the AddThis Tools for security and operations management to help keep Oracle, customer, and partner networks and systems, as well as our products and services, secure.  We may also collect usage and systems operations data from the AddThis Tools to investigate and prevent cyber-attacks, malicious activity, or potential fraud, including ad fraud and to detect bots.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> h) To comply with applicable laws and regulations and to operate our business. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  In some cases, we may process AddThis Data to comply with applicable laws and regulations. For example, to respond to a request from a regulator or to defend a legal claim. We may also process AddThis Data in the operation of our business. For example, to conduct audits and investigations, for finance and accounting, archiving and insurance purposes.</p></p> <div><h3>  6. WHAT COOKIES, PIXEL TAGS AND OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DOES ADDTHIS USE?</h3><p>  Cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels tags and device identifiers) are used by Oracle and our advertising technology partners to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices for the purposes specified in Section 5 above.</p><p>  <strong> Cookies </strong> are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser on a connected device. We or our partners use cookies to, among other things, track user trends and collect information about how you use Publishers’ Sites or interact with advertising. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies by default. You may, however, be able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is being sent. Check your browser's 'help' files to learn more about handling cookies.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Pixel Tags </strong> (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) are invisible 1 x 1 pixels that are placed on webpages that use this technology for marketing and measurement purposes. When you access these webpages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit. Pixel tags can be used with cookies or alone. When used with cookies, pixel tags can track activity on a site by a particular device and provide relevant online advertising to you. When you turn off cookies or have opted out of cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit and how you interacted with the advertising but do not track an individual to provide relevant online advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Redirect notice. </strong> When you use the AddThis Tools on a Publisher Site to share information and content the Publisher makes available on the Publisher Site (“<strong> Publisher Content </strong>”), you are redirected through the AddThis Site before you are directed to your destination website where you want to publish or share the Publisher Content (e.g., to share Publisher Content to a social media site such as Facebook).</p></p> <div><h3>  7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3><p>  Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations, individuals in certain jurisdictions may have data subject rights enabling them to opt-out of third party sharing or selling, or request deletion or correction of, or access to, their personal information in Oracle’s possession or for which Oracle is otherwise responsible.</p><p>  <strong> Opt-out and object to our use of personal information. </strong> Oracle offers multiple ways for you to opt out of third party sharing or selling and object to our use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> AddThis Opt-out. </strong> If you prefer that Oracle and our third party partners do not receive your personal information via Cookies and Pixels for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, you may opt out of collection at any time via the Oracle Advertising opt-out, available at <a href="https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/#optout" target="_blank"> https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/#optout </a>. Upon opting out, we will place an opt-out Cookie on your device. The opt-out Cookie tells the AddThis Tools not to include information from that device in AddThis Data.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> AdTech Industry Opt-out. </strong> You may also opt out of third party sharing or selling by Oracle Advertising by using the opt-out tools provided by the following industry groups:
</li><li>Digital Advertising Alliance (‘DAA’): <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank"> http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ </a></li><li>Network Advertising Initiative (‘NAI’): <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank"> http://optout.networkadvertising.org </a></li><li>European Interactive Digital Adverting Alliance (‘EDAA’): <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank"> http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ </a> and <a href="http://www.edaa.eu/" target="_blank"> http://www.edaa.eu/ </a>
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Do Not Track. </strong> Oracle honors “Do Not Track” browser settings, meaning we will not track your browser for marketing purposes while you have “Do Not Track” turned on in your browser settings.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Please note that if you opt out using the first two opt out tools, you may still temporarily receive marketing due to marketing campaigns already underway. However, you will be opted-out of all future marketing campaigns that use Oracle Advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  Also note that the first two opt out tools are currently cookie-based and prevent Oracle from using, sharing, or selling your personal information for interest-based advertising on the browser on which they are installed. As a result, the opt out will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies and may not function where cookies are sometimes automatically disabled or removed (e.g., certain mobile devices and operating systems). If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt out again. Oracle does not use persistent, unique identifiers to revive a previously opted-out profile or deleted cookie.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Blocking Emails Shared via AddThis Tools. </strong> You may opt of sharing content (with other users for example) by email using the AddThis Tools. By using the AddThis Tools, You agree to abide by the general rules of conduct in the <a href="http://www.addthis.com/privacy/terms-of-service/" target="_blank"> AddThis Terms of Service </a>. Oracle does not verify the email address you provide to share content via email. Oracle will delete the email address within 90 days of collection. To opt out of emails sent by you using AddThis Tools, please use the opt-out tool available at: http://www.addthis.com/privacy/email-opt-out.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Access personal information </strong>
In order to exercise your right to access your online information, you can use the <a href="https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/registry/" target="_blank"> Oracle Advertising Registry </a> (“<strong> Registry </strong>”) to view the online segments Oracle has associated with your device. Information available in the Registry is not limited to the preceding 12 months, rather the Registry provides the entire view of online segments associated with the cookie on your browser. By accessing this Registry, you can view the types of third-party interest segments that are shared with or sold to Oracle Advertising customers. Please note that the interest segments you see within the Registry is information about you from the profile associated with the specific browser, computer or device that you are using to visit the Registry. You may see different segments when viewing the Registry from a different browser, computer or device. We therefore recommend using different browsers and devices when accessing the Registry.</p></p> <p><p>  We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law unless such data is only retained for legal and compliance purposes. Oracle will not discriminate against consumers who have exercised the deletion, opt-out, or access rights provided to them in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Delete or correct personal information </strong>
Unless retained solely for legal and compliance purposes, Oracle will delete or correct your online or offline personal information, upon request, as set forth below:</p></p> <p><p>  You can erase or delete the AddThis Data Oracle is processing about your device or remove segments in the <a href="https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/registry/" target="_blank"> Registry </a> by opting out of AddThis services using the <a href="https://datacloudoptout.oracle.com/registry/" target="_blank"> opt-out tool </a>.

FOR HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN ADDTHIS DATA?</h3><p>  Oracle maintains personal information for the following retention periods:</p><p>  We retain AddThis Data for <strong> 13 months </strong> as of collection. A 1% sample of AddThis Data (“<strong> Sample Dataset </strong>”) is retained for a maximum of 24 months for business continuity purposes. Oracle hashes the direct and indirect identifiers (such as IP address and cookie ID) in the Sample Dataset. ‘Hashing’ means the personal information cannot be associated with an individual without the use of additional information.</p></div> <div><h3>  11. HOW IS ADDTHIS DATA SECURED?</h3><p>  Oracle has implemented appropriate technical, physical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, damage, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access as well as all other forms of unlawful processing.</p></div> <div><h3>  12. DO WE PROCESS SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3><p>  Oracle does not create any online interest segments that reflect personal information that is sensitive, as defined by law and self-regulatory frameworks, or personal information that Oracle has deemed “sensitive.” We also have operational procedures in our platform designed to prevent our partners and customers from using personal information provided to them by Oracle to create interest segments that we consider sensitive. While the types of personal information considered sensitive may vary among consumers and applicable law, we treat the following types of personal information as sensitive:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>precise mental or physical health, biometric, or genetic information, such as a certain sensitive medical condition like cancer or diabetes;</li><li>pregnancy, such as pregnancy choices, pregnancy termination, reproductive rights, and traveling to exercise reproductive rights;</li><li>certain aspects linked to personal life, such as racial or ethnic, religious, political, citizenship, immigration status, or sexual orientation;</li><li>social security or other state identification number, financial account numbers or login information for such accounts;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>interest in “adult” activities, such as drug use, an interest in weapons, or pornographic material; and</li><li>information considered sensitive based on applicable law.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We do not allow our customers or partners to use data provided to them by Oracle: (i) to make decisions related to an individual’s eligibility for employment, credit, healthcare, insurance, tenancy, or education purposes; (ii) to make decisions solely by automatic means where the decision has a significant effect on the individual; or (iii) in any way that may or does discriminate against any person or promote bigotry, racism, or harm. For these purposes, Oracle considers harm to be inclusive of the use of data provided by Oracle to target vulnerable individuals or groups with fraudulent or deceptive marketing campaigns or to be used in any manner that causes vulnerable individuals harm.</p></p> <p><p>  As noted above, Oracle does not create interest segments that reflect sensitive medical conditions. For a list of our non-sensitive health and wellness segments, please see <a href="/a/ocom/docs/corporate/health-and-wellness-segments.pdf" target="_blank"> this link (PDF) </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  13.
