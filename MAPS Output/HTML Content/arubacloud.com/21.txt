Any user of a website can easily share anything on the web with their friends on social sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, Email, Digg, Reddit and more through using one of our tools on that website (“<strong> ShareThis Icon </strong>”).</p><p>  ShareThis also collects pseudonymous data about internet users and how they interact with content, websites, and advertisements while online. Some of the data is collected via our tools such as the <strong> ShareThis Icon </strong>, and some is collected through third-party data providers. We compile this data and provide it to our Publishers and license it to advertisers, agencies, and other businesses (our “Customers”) to facilitate the delivery of relevant, targeted advertising and for a number of other reasons which are listed below.</p></div> <p><p>  We do this by using technology such as cookies and pixels (including the pixels and cookies of our customers) (“<strong> ShareThis Publisher Applications </strong>”) to gather information regarding the browsing and sharing activities of Internet users, both on websites that have the ShareThis Icon and similar tools installed on them. We also receive data from others who operate in the data analytics and advertising industries. We analyze and aggregate the data we collect to create groups of data (called audience segments) based on defined criteria.  For example, we segment into groups internet users who we believe have similar characteristics, interests, needs or behavioral patterns. Where we are able to infer that two or more browsers or devices are the same user or household, we may use that information to bolster our audience segments. We compile this data to provide analytics to our Publishers and license it to our Customers for a number of purposes as described below, including targeted advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  Targeted advertising has the aim of displaying advertising which is more likely to be of interest to internet users, based on analyses of their recent browsing and sharing activities and interactions with the website and adverts. It is also sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising or online behavioral advertising. For more information on this type of advertising, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising" target="_blank"> click here </a>.</p></p> <div><h2>  Contents</h2><p>  I. <strong> Data Collection and Use </strong></p><p>  In order to offer our products and services, we collect and use data relating to the websites you visit to display personalized advertisements, provide analytics, and data modeling based on social sharing, by us or third parties. This data is pseudonymous personal data in that it may not be used directly by ShareThis to identify an actual person. This data does enable our systems to recognize your computer, device and/or browser over time. In many places, this pseudonymous data is considered personal data and/or personal information under applicable law.</p></div> <p><p>  We do not intentionally collect identifiable personal information such as your name, postal address, phone number, email address, credit card information, or anything else that can allow us or our customers to contact you directly as part of our products and services. We may collect identifiable personal information and even financial information such as payment or bank details if you are one of our Publishers or if you have a business relationship with ShareThis.</p></p> <p><p>  We have set out below the categories of data we process and why we process each category of data.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Usage Data and Profile Information </strong></li></ul><p>  <strong> 1.1 Usage Data </strong></p><p>  We collect information about how <em> Internet users </em> browse the Internet and interact with online content and advertisements through our ShareThis Icon, the ShareThis Publisher Applications and user interactions with advertisements on the Internet. We call this “Usage Data”.</p><p>  Usage Data includes:</p><ul>  <li>The unique IDs of the cookie(s) placed on your web browser (example: 37d387ca-f68a-11e5-b87d-0e58954c72b1) and/or a hashed version of an email address which help us recognize your browser or device over time.</li><li>Information about the user’s browser and device</li><li>User agent string</li><li>Webpages viewed (including the URL addresses of such pages and search parameters, which may include search terms and key words) and the previous web pages that referred the user to that webpage </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Time when webpages are viewed</li><li>Search queries from which users are directed to a webpage</li><li>Navigation from page to page</li><li>Time spent on each webpage</li><li>Interactions with the webpage, including items clicked or selected and content highlighted or copied</li><li>Ads viewed or displayed to the user and the user’s interactions with those ads</li><li>Shares of content including what content is shared and where – for example, the relevant social media site (e.g., Twitter, Facebook)</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Geographic information such as country, city, state, or postal code.</li><li>IP addresses</li><li>Device IDs</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Although the Usage Data listed above is not used by ShareThis to directly identify an actual person, it is considered to be personal data in many places.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 1.2 Profile Information </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We receive information about the content of the websites that you visit and information about the audience of those websites to enable us to infer and create groups of users who have similar characteristics, interests, or behavioral patterns. We combine the Usage Data with data we receive from third party advertisers, analytics vendors and data partners to create categories of data that are helpful to advertisers seeking to deliver a more personalized advertising experience. For example, if a user regularly views or shares content about shopping for a car, our systems may infer that this user may be interested in purchasing an automobile.  This practice is sometimes referred to as interest-based advertising, and a segment titled “interested in automobile” is sometimes referred to as an audience segment or a “profile.” When we group this data into profiles, we refer to it as<strong>  “Profile Information”. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We can infer this Profile Information (by reference to browser identifiers, not actual names) using the information we obtain from third parties about the likely content and characteristics of the users and audiences of the websites which are visited. For example, visitors to a particular website may have an interest in cars while visitors to a different website may typically be within a certain age or income range. Where we are able to infer that two or more browsers or devices are the same user or household, we may use that information to bolster our Profile Information.</p></p> <p><p>  The characteristics by which we group users relate to age ranges, income ranges, education, gender, product or activity interests and family composition (e.g., how many children in the family), on the basis of information available about the typical audience of websites they visit and content viewed.</p></p> <p><p>  In certain cases where Publishers that we work with utilize the “Google Analytics By ShareThis WordPress” plug-in on their websites, ShareThis uses a Google Analytics feature currently known as Google Analytics Demographics, in order to better understand the audience demographics of those Publisher websites, and to provide insights about those demographics to the Publishers that own or operate those websites. To learn more about Google Analytics’ privacy practices, please click <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank"> here </a>. To opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, please click <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"> here </a>, or you may also visit the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank"> NAI consumer choice page </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  In the U.S., ShareThis creates modeled segments based off of demographic attributes where those attributes are aligned with the target audience of products marketed by pharmaceutical drug companies. </p></p> <p><p>  If you would like to see a list of the types of Profile Information used by ShareThis, including any Profile Information that is health or political in nature (U.S. only), please <a href="https://sharethis.com/privacy-audiences/" target="_blank"> click here.  </a>ShareThis does not create Profile Information based on topics we believe to be sensitive under applicable law, or based on visits to adult entertainment websites.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 1.3 How we obtain Usage Data and Profile Information </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We collect Usage Data when your device visits our website, uses or interacts with our services (including sharing content with the ShareThis Icon), when your device visits Publishers’ websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications, and when your device views or clicks advertisements that we serve or are served on our behalf. We do so by using cookies placed on your browser (to the extent that cookies are not-restricted by the browser), pixel tags, and HTTP headers (or other communication protocols) and the use of hashed email address. We may also use probabilistic IDs generated via the user agent string and IP address when cookies are restricted by the browser.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> Our use of Cookies and other Tracking Technologies </em></p><p>  <strong> Web Environment: </strong> (desktop, tablet, and smartphone browsers)</p><p>  ShareThis places cookies containing a UID on the browsers of visitors to websites that use ShareThis Publisher Applications.

When you visit a webpage, ShareThis’ pixel will see if your browser has a ShareThis cookie installed on it. If it doesn’t, the pixel will place the cookie. If the browser already has a ShareThis cookie, the pixel will “read” the cookie and will send us information such as the time you viewed a webpage, the type of browser used and your IP address. This is how we learn about your interests and enable our customers to deliver targeted advertising to you.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> HTTP headers:  </strong>These are transmitted whenever a webpage is viewed, and contain technical information required to connect your browser to the webpage. This information may include information about the browser and the requested webpage. ShareThis collects this information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Hashed emails:  </strong>Hashing an email is a cryptographic function. Hashing is a way of encrypting a piece of data, like an email address, into a hexadecimal string. By doing this, each email address becomes an unrecognizable jumble of numbers and letters. This technique doesn’t allow us to send you an email message or to identify who you are. However, it does allow us to recognize your browser or device in the same way that cookies help us to recognize your browser or device. ShareThis may obtain hashed emails from our advertising partners to help provide our products and services. We may also receive and hash emails you provide to our Publishers. For more information, and to better understand the choices available to you, please visit https://thenai.org/opt-out/ama-opt-out/.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Mobile Environments: </strong> (Mobile applications)</p><p>  To serve ads in mobile applications identifiers may be used, such as Google Advertising ID or Apple IDFA, depending on the operating system of your mobile device. The advertiser identifier does not identify you directly, but it enables advertisers and their technology partners to recognize your mobile device over time. Many of the mobile operating systems which provide these advertising IDs also provide the functionality to reset them and/or to record your opt-out choice.

The advertiser identifier does not identify you directly, but it enables advertisers and their technology partners to recognize your smart TV and/or streaming device over time. Many streaming devices and smart TVs that provide these advertising IDs also provide the functionality to reset them and/or to record your opt-out choice.

We may enable the linking of our Usage Data through cookie syncing. We do not use plain text information that may be used by ShareThis to identify you such as your name or address to operate the linking. Our data partners may use exact linking methods by leveraging the pseudonymous data collected through our technology such as advertising partner identifiers.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Probabilistic IDs </strong>: Some browsers may block or otherwise restrict our ability to place cookies in the ShareThis domain. When this occurs, ShareThis may use a combination of user agent and IP address to help us recognize a browser or device over time.</p></p> <p><p>  You can manage cookies, change consents, or opt out of personalized ads using the mechanisms described in ‘<a href="https://sharethis.com/privacy/#user-choices" target="_blank"> User Choices’ </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 1.4 How we use Usage Data and Profile Information </strong></p></p> <div><p>  We use Usage Data and Profile Information internally for the following business purposes:</p><ul>  <li>To enable our tools to function;</li><li>Pursuant to our relationship with Google Analytics Demographics, to enable demographic reporting features we provide to our Publishers;</li><li>To link browsers and devices that we infer might belong to the same household;</li><li>To enable us to sync unique identifiers;</li><li>To enable ST to manage the security of our Website, tools, networks, and systems.</li><li>To comply with applicable laws.</li></ul></div> <div><p>  We may also use Usage Data and Profile Information and/or audience segments and license such information to our Customers for the following business purposes including (where not prohibited under applicable law):</p><ul>  <li>To enable the delivery of targeted advertising</li><li>To conduct market research and analytics in order to find meaningful patterns in the data that enables ShareThis to draw insights into how web Users generally behave.

We will only know what content you shared, and that you did so by means of email. We do not receive any information about the email itself, for example, your email address, the email address of the recipient or the content of your email. We are not responsible for the information shared by users via the ShareThis Publisher Applications.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Account Information </strong></li></ul><p>  “<strong> Account Information </strong>” means the information which <em> Publishers </em> and <em> representatives of Publishers </em> provide when they register for an account with us and when they use their account.</p><p>  Many of our services can be used without registering with us.

The personal data we hold about you refers to your professional life (name, email address, billing address, office address, phone numbers, title, company you work for). We would have collected that information from exchanging emails or business cards, meeting at industry meetings or client sessions etc. We may process that data for a number of legitimate business purposes, including: a) to communicate with you within the context of our business relationship; b) to provide our products or services; c) for billing and invoicing purposes; and d) for sales, marketing and product promotional purposes ((e.g., uploading emails into LinkedIn and similar platforms to advertise new services to current and prospective Customers).</p></div> <p><p>  This data may also be processed for the purposes set out in the section ‘<a href="https://sharethis.com/privacy/#general-purposes" target="_blank"> General purposes which apply to all data.’ </a></p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Employee and Job Applicants’ data </strong></li></ul><p>  If you are an employee of ShareThis, or you apply for a role with ShareThis, in the US or in Europe, please refer to our HR Policy for information about how we process your data.

This information is used only for the reasons for which it was collected, such as responding to your communication, and it is not shared with third parties other than trusted service providers who are contractually required to only use such data to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.</p></p> <p><p>  We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect data automatically when you visit ShareThis.com and use that information to help administer the Website, to remember your preferences, to conduct website analytics and for security and fraud prevention purposes.  </p></p> <p><p>  Where we enable third parties to collect pseudonymous information on ShareThis.com (e.g., using cookies and pixels), that information may be viewed as a sale of data by ShareThis under applicable in certain jurisdictions such as California. To address this, we provide you with a privacy notice when you visit the Website and the opportunity to opt-out of these third-party data collection practices on our Website. We encourage you to visit the applicable policies of those third parties or visit www.aboutads.info to learn more about interest-based advertising and to see your opt-out choices from other participating companies that may be collecting and using data on ShareThis.com.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> General purposes which apply to all data </strong></li></ul><p>  There are a number of “general” reasons that ShareThis may process data on our systems. Many of them are required by applicable law and/or to help us ensure that the Internet remains a safe space. Some of them enable us to promote and grow our business. If you’d like additional information, please email privacy@sharethis.com. </p><p>  We may also process data for the following purposes: a) as required by applicable law; b) to cooperate with competent legal authorities such as data protection regulators, the police and the FBI; c) to enforce our terms and conditions, including by obtaining advice and conducting legal proceedings; d) to protect our operations, property and interests, and those of third parties; e) to sell and promote the sale of our business and/or assets.</p></div> <p><p>  Finally, ShareThis may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. If ShareThis is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.</p></p> <p><p>  II. <strong> The GDPR and Your Rights as an EU, Swiss, or UK Data Subject </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to our processing of personal data. If you are located in Switzerland, The Swiss Federal Data Protection Act applies to our processing of personal data. If you are located in the United Kingdom, then the Data Protection Act 2018 applies to our processing of personal data. These laws each grant those located respectively in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK a set of clear privacy rights and imposes responsibilities on ShareThis as we process the personal data of data subjects located in those places. The ShareThis privacy policy outlines how and why ShareThis processes personal data. This section is designed to provide more information on how ShareThis adheres to the above data protection laws and your rights as a data subject. For purposes of this privacy policy, we’ll refer to the above data protection laws as “EEA Data Protection Laws” and data subjects located in the above places as “EEA Data Subjects.”</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Definition of Personal Data </strong></p><p>  EEA Data Protection Laws define personal data broadly. As such, where Usage Data and/or Profile Information relates to an individual in the EEA, we treat it as personal data. Similarly, nearly all of the data collected from EEA Data Subjects in the context of our normal business operations is likely to be considered personal data. This includes: a) data collected via visits to ShareThis.com; b) data collected from Customers, Publishers and business partners; and c) data collected from employees and prospective employees.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Special Categories of Personal Data </strong></p><p>  ShareThis does not collect nor process any special categories of personal data with respect to EEA Data Subjects, and we do not create Profile Information of audience segments of such consumers based on special categories of personal data (i.e. data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation).</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Legal Basis for Processing </strong></p><p>  EEA Data Protection Laws requires entities seeking to process personal data to have a valid legal basis for doing so. The legal basis utilized by ShareThis include: a) consent (our primary legal basis with respect to our Processing of Usage Data and Profile Information); b) legitimate interest (i.e., where we believe that our need to process the data and/or the value we deliver by processing such data is not outweighed by the rights of the data subject); c) where necessary for the performance of a contract; and d) where processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations. We will endeavor to outline our legal basis for the most common types of processing conducted by ShareThis.</p></div> <p><p>  <em> Cookie and Similar Tracking Technologies  </em>– We endeavor to obtain consent for our placement of cookies, pixels and similar tracking technologies as required under the ePrivacy Directive as implemented throughout the EEA. As ShareThis does not have direct relationships with Internet users in many cases, we ask Publishers and other partners to obtain a consent on our behalf as described below.  Where we directly place cookies (e.g., via ShareThis.com) we directly obtain the consent from data subjects we’ve identified as being from the EEA or other place where consent is required.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Usage Data and Profile Information </em> – We obtain a consent for our placement of cookies as described above, and ShareThis also processes Usage Data and Profile Information with consent.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Website Data </em>– We collect personal data via ShareThis.com. Where that data is provided to ShareThis (e.g., via completing an online form), we consider it either Account Data and/or data collected pursuant to a business relationship which are described below. Where we place cookies via the Website, we use consent. Where data is collected automatically (e.g., log files containing IP addresses), we process such data via our legitimate interest and in order to maintain the Website and help us to a better job of personalizing the Website to the interests of visitors.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Account Data and Business Relationships </em> – We require some Publishers to setup an Account with ShareThis. Similarly, we maintain accounts containing personal data with most of the vendors who provide services to ShareThis, our Customers, our employees, and our business partners. If you are an employee of one of those entities, ShareThis may have your personal data including your name, your work email, or your work telephone number. For data subjects located in the EEA or UK, we process this data under the legal basis of contractual necessity. In other words, we need to process this data in order to honor the terms of the contract between ShareThis and the Publisher, Customer, vendor, Etc. This includes maintaining an account and login credentials, billing and payment purposes, communicating with the other party, and fulfilling requests. Where we are seeking to market additional products and services to these entities, we will do so via legitimate interest unless applicable law dictates that we use consent (e.g., for email marketing).</p></p> <p><p>  <em> General Purposes </em> – There are a number of instances where ShareThis processes personal data which are distinct from the descriptions provided above. For example:</p></p> <p><p>  Legal and Regulatory Compliance – Like most companies, ShareThis will process data in order to comply with law, cooperate with requests from competent legal authorities such as the police, and to pay taxes. The legal basis for this type of processing is necessary for ShareThis to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</p></p> <p><p>  Enforcement of legal obligations – To enforce our terms and conditions, protect of our intellectual property and/or the rights of third parties, ShareThis processes personal data in these instances via our legitimate interest.

Where the EEA Data Protection Laws apply to Usage Data and Profile Information and we share this data with our Customers, our Customers are independent controllers in relation to their processing of such data and they process it in accordance with their own privacy policies. ShareThis is also the controller of the data it collects via ShareThis.com.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Data Processors </strong></p><p>  ShareThis also has a number of agents and service providers who operate as processors of data on ShareThis’ behalf. These agents and service providers are only able to use the data as specifically directed by ShareThis and only to provide the services requested by us.

Some of these rights apply only in certain circumstances and depend on the legal basis relied upon to process the data. As an example, the right to object applies to processing which is carried out because it is necessary for our legitimate interests and only if we cannot demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which outweigh your rights, interests and freedoms. The same right does not apply to processing which is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations or to perform a contract with you. These rights may extend to the personal data we place into cookies or similar tracking technologies.</p></div> <p><p>  Where processing is based on your consent, in accordance with the GDPR and UK Data Protection Act (as applicable), you may withdraw that consent at any time, although any processing previously carried out will still be legal.

When we share data, we provide data to companies globally. In each case, we have safeguards in place which allow those transfers to happen in a way that ensures data is handled in accordance with the applicable law. </p><p>  When we transfer personal data outside the EEA or UK, unless the recipient or location to which the data is transferred has been approved by the appropriate authorities as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, we put in place measures to ensure that the transfer complies with the applicable data protection law and that the personal data which is transferred is appropriately safeguarded.</p></div> <p><p>  When we enter into business relationships which involves the transfer of  personal data of EEA Data Subjects to the United States, we put in place reasonable transfer mechanisms such as the EU standard contractual clauses with the recipient. More information about international data transfers under the GDPR can be found at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en" target="_blank"> https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en </a>.  If requested, we may make available a copy of such safeguards, as required by EAA Data Protection Laws.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> Data Protection Officer and Representative </em></p><p>  ShareThis has appointed a data protection officer to supervise our personal data processing-related activities, and to respond to requests as required.  Our DPO can be contacted as follows: Vincent Potier (ShareThis DPO): <a href="mailto:dpo@sharethis.com" target="_blank"> dpo@sharethis.com </a> </p><p>  ShareThis’ representative in the UK is: ShareThis UK Limited of 10 John Street, London WC1N 2EB, UK.</p><p>  ShareThis’ representative in the EU is: Verasafe and they may be reached at representative@sharethis.com.</p></div> <p><p>  III. <strong> The LGPD and Your Rights as a Brazil Data Subject </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you are located in Brazil, then the Brazilian General Law for the Protection of Personal Data (LGPD) applies to our processing of personal data. The LGPD grants those located Brazil a set of clear privacy rights and imposes responsibilities on ShareThis as we process the personal data of data subjects located in Brazil. The ShareThis privacy policy outlines how and why ShareThis processes personal data. This section is designed to provide more information on how ShareThis adheres to the LGPD and your rights as a data subject located in Brazil.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Definition of Personal Data </strong></p><p>  The LGPD defines personal data broadly. As such, where Usage Data and/or Profile Information relates to an individual in the Brazil, we treat it as personal data. Similarly, nearly all of the data collected from EEA and UK data subjects in the context of our normal business operations is likely to be considered personal data. This includes: a) data collected via visits to ShareThis.com; b) data collected from Customers, Publishers and business partners; and c) data collected from employees and prospective employees, as applicable.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Special Categories of Personal Data </strong>ShareThis does not collect nor process any special categories of personal data with respect to data subjects in Brazil.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Legal Basis for Processing </strong>The LGPD entities seeking to process personal data to have a valid legal basis for doing so. The legal basis utilized by ShareThis include: a) consent; b) legitimate interest (i.e., where we believe that our need to process the data and/or the value we deliver by processing such data is not outweighed by the rights of the data subject); c) where necessary for the performance of a contract; and d) where processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Brazil and Data Subject Rights </strong>Where the LGPD applies, such data subjects have certain rights, including: a) The right to be informed about the types of data being processed and the legal basis for processing; b) the right to access and see the data being processed; c) the right of rectification, to make corrections to data subject to processing; d) the right to erase data; e) the right to restrict processing of data; f) the right of data portability; g) the right to object to the processing of data and f) the right not to be subject to automated decision-making. Some of these rights apply only in certain circumstances and depend on the legal basis relied upon to process the data. If you are located in Brazil and have questions about how ShareThis implements these rights, please email us at privacy@sharethis.com.</p></p> <p><p>  IV. <strong> The U.S. State Privacy Laws (e.g., CCPA) and Your Rights as a Data Subject </strong></p></p> <p><p>  A number of U.S. states (e.g., California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Virginia, and Utah) have enacted laws that may provide additional privacy protections for data subjects and users located into those states, including:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>the right to see what data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to know),</li><li>the right to correct the data we have about you, your computer or device,</li><li>the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to delete), and</li><li>the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of data about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales or sharing of your information) and the right to opt-out of profiling and/or targeted ads.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  These U.S. state laws define personal information broadly. And as such, almost all of the information we collect is considered personal information under these laws.

California data subjects may also call us on our toll free CCPA privacy hotline at 1-800-272-1765.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not treat users that exercise any of the above rights differently. However, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law. ShareThis does not sell data collected via our Website or the data we use to operate our business. However, we transfer personal information collected via the ShareThis Publisher Applications to third parties and as such are considered to have sold data over the past twelve months under California law, including any of the Usage Data, Profile Information and/or audience segments.</p></p> <p><p>  We generally ask only for the minimum information necessary to help us process a subject access or deletion request and will keep information pertaining to your request for up to two years.
