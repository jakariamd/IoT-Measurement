<div><h1>  Appendix A. Hardware and Network Protection</h1><p>  The best practice before deploying a machine into a production
      environment or connecting your network to the Internet is to determine
      your organizational needs and how security can fit into the requirements
      as transparently as possible. Since the main goal of the
      <i> Red Hat Enterprise Linux Security Guide </i> is to explain how to secure Red Hat Enterprise Linux, a more
      detailed examination of hardware and physical network security is beyond
      the scope of this document. However, this chapter presents a brief
      overview of establishing security policies with regard to hardware and
      physical networks. Important factors to consider include how computing
      needs and connectivity requirements fit into the overall security
      strategy. The following explains some of these factors in detail.
    </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><i> Computing </i> involves more than just
	  workstations running desktop software. Modern organizations require
	  massive computational power and highly-available services, which can
	  include mainframes, compute or application clusters, powerful
	  workstations, and specialized appliances. With these organizational
	  requirements, however, come increased susceptibility to hardware
	  failure, natural disasters, and tampering or theft of equipment.
	</li><li><i> Connectivity </i> is the method by which an
	  administrator intends to connect disparate resources on a network. An
	  administrator may use Ethernet (hubbed or switched CAT-5/RJ-45
	  cabling), token ring, 10-base-2 coaxial cable, or even wireless
	  (802.11) technologies. Depending on which
	  medium an administrator chooses, certain media and network topologies
	  require complementary technologies such as hubs, routers, switches,
	  base stations, and access points. Determining a functional network
	  architecture will allow an easier administrative process if security
	  issues arise.
	</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  From these general considerations, administrators can get a better
      view of implementation. The design of a computing environment can then be
      based on both organizational needs and security considerations â€” an
      implementation that evenly assesses both factors.</p></p> <div><h1>  A.1. Secure Network Topologies</h1><p>  The foundation of a LAN is the <i> topology </i>, or
	network architecture. A topology is the physical and logical layout of a
	LAN in terms of resources provided, distance between nodes, and
	transmission medium. Depending upon the needs of the organization that
	the network services, there are several choices available for network
	implementation. Each topology has its advantages and security issues
	that network architects should regard when designing their network
	layout.</p></div> <div><h2>  A.1.1. Physical Topologies</h2><p>  As defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
	Engineers (IEEE), there are three common topologies for the physical
	connection of a LAN.</p></div> <div><h3>  A.1.1.1. Ring Topology</h3><p>  The <i> Ring </i> topology connects each node by
	    exactly two connections. This creates a ring structure where each
	    node is accessible to the other, either directly by its two
	    physically closest neighboring nodes or indirectly through the
	    physical ring. Token Ring, FDDI, and SONET networks are connected in
	    this fashion (with FDDI utilizing a dual-ring technique); however,
	    there are no common Ethernet connections using this physical
	    topology, so rings are not commonly deployed except in legacy or
	    institutional settings with a large installed base of nodes (for
	    example, a university).
	</p></div> <div><h3>  A.1.1.2. Linear Bus Topology</h3><p>  The <i> linear bus </i> topology consists of nodes
	which connect to a terminated main linear cable (the backbone). The
	linear bus topology requires the least amount of cabling and networking
	equipment, making it the most cost-effective topology. However, the
	linear bus depends on the backbone being constantly available, making it
	a single point-of-failure if it has to be taken off-line or is
	severed. Linear bus topologies are commonly used in peer-to-peer LANs
	using co-axial (coax) cabling and 50-93 ohm terminators at both ends of
	the bus.</p></div> <div><h3>  A.1.1.3. Star Topology</h3><p>  The <i> Star </i>
	topology incorporates a central point where nodes connect and through
	which communication is passed. This centerpoint, called a
	<i> hub </i> can be either
	<i> broadcasted </i> or
	<i> switched </i>. This topology does introduce a single
	point of failure in the centralized networking hardware that connects
	the nodes. However, because of this centralization, networking issues
	that affect segments or the entire LAN itself are easily traceable to
	this one source.</p></div> <div><h2>  A.1.2. Transmission Considerations</h2><p>  In a broadcast network, a node will send a packet that traverses
	  through every other node until the recipient accepts the packet. Every
	  node in the network can conceivably receive this packet of data until
	  the recipient processes the packet. In a broadcast network, all
	  packets are sent in this manner.</p><p>  In a switched network, packets are not broadcasted, but are
	  processed in the switched hub which, in turn, creates a
	  <i> direct </i> connection between the sending and
	  recipient nodes using the unicast transmission principles. This
	  eliminates the need to broadcast packets to each node, thus lowering
	  traffic overhead.</p></div> <p><p>  The switched network also prevents packets from being intercepted
	  by malicious nodes or users. In a broadcast network, where each node
	  receives the packet on the way to its destination, malicious users can
	  set their Ethernet device to <i> promiscuous </i> mode
	  and accept all packets regardless of whether or not the data is
	  intended for them. Once in promiscuous mode, a sniffer application can
	  be used to filter, analyze, and reconstruct packets for passwords,
	  personal data, and more. Sophisticated sniffer applications can store
	  such information in text files and, perhaps, even send the information
	  to arbitrary sources (for example, the malicious user's email
	  address).
	</p></p> <p><p>  A switched network requires a network switch, a specialized piece
	  of hardware which replaces the role of the traditional hub in which
	  all nodes on a LAN are connected. Switches store MAC addresses of all
	  nodes within an internal database, which it uses to perform its direct
	  routing. Several manufacturers, including Cisco Systems, Linksys, and
	  Netgear offer various types of switches with features such as
	  10/100-Base-T compatibility, gigabit Ethernet support, and support for
	  Carrier Sensing Multiple Access and Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
	  which is ideal for high-traffic networks because it queues connections
	  and detect when packets collide in transit.
	</p></p> <div><h2>  A.1.3. Wireless Networks</h2><p>  An emerging issue for enterprises today is that of
	  mobility. Remote workers, field technicians, and executives require
	  portable solutions, such as laptops, Personal Digital Assistants
	  (PDAs), and wireless access to network resources. The IEEE has
	  established a standards body for the 802.11 wireless specification,
	  which establishes standards for wireless data communication throughout
	  all industries. The current standard in practice today is the 802.11b
	  specification.</p></div> <p><p>  The 802.11b and 802.11g specifications are actually a group of
	  standards governing wireless communication and access control on the
	  unlicensed 2.4GHz radio-frequency (RF) spectrum (802.11a uses the 5GHz
	  spectrum). These specifications have been approved as standards by the
	  IEEE, and several vendors market 802.11
	  products and services. Consumers have also embraced the standard for
	  small-office/home-office (SOHO) networks. The popularity has also
	  extended from LANs to MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks), especially in
	  populated areas where a concentration of wireless access points (WAPs)
	  are available. There are also wireless Internet service providers
	  (WISPs) that cater to frequent travelers requiring broadband Internet
	  access to conduct business remotely.</p></p> <p><p>  The 802.11 specifications allow for
	  direct, peer-to-peer connections between nodes with wireless
	  NICs. This loose grouping of nodes, called an <i> ad
	  hoc </i> network, is ideal for quick connection sharing between
	  two or more nodes, but introduces scalability issues that are not
	  suitable for dedicated wireless connectivity.</p></p> <p><p>  A more suitable solution for wireless access in fixed structures
	  is to install one or more WAPs that connect to the traditional network
	  and allow wireless nodes to connect to the WAP as if it were on the
	  Ethernet-mediated network. The WAP effectively acts as a bridge
	  between the nodes connected to it and the rest of the network.
	</p></p> <div><h3>  A.1.3.1. 802.11 Security</h3><p>  Although wireless networking is comparable in speed and
	  certainly more convenient than traditional wired networking mediums,
	  there are some limitations to the specification that warrants thorough
	  consideration. The most important of these limitations is in its
	  security implementation.</p><p>  In the excitement of successfully deploying an
	  802.11 network, many administrators fail
	  to exercise even the most basic security precautions. Since all
	  802.11 networking is done using high-band
	  RF signals, the data transmitted is easily accessible to any user with
	  a compatible NIC, a wireless network scanning tool such as
	  <b> NetStumbler </b> or
	  <b> Wellenreiter </b>, and common sniffing tools
	  such as  and . To
	  prevent such aberrant usage of private wireless networks, the 802.11b
	  standard uses the Wired Equivalency Privacy (WEP) protocol, which is
	  an RC4-based 64- or 128-bit encrypted key shared between each node or
	  between the AP and the node. This key encrypts transmissions and
	  decrypts incoming packets dynamically and
	  transparently. Administrators often fail to employ this shared-key
	  encryption scheme, however; either they forget to do so or choose not
	  to do so because of performance degradation (especially over long
	  distances). Enabling WEP on a wireless network can greatly reduce the
	  possibility of data interception.
	  </p></div> <p><p>  Red Hat Enterprise Linux supports various 802.11
	    products from several vendors. The
	    <b> Network Administration Tool </b> includes a facility for
	    configuring wireless NICs and WEP security. For information about
	    using the <b> Network Administration Tool </b>, refer to the
	    chapter entitled <i> Network Configuration </i> in
	    the <i> Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Administration Guide </i>.</p></p> <p><p>  Relying on WEP, however, is still not a sound enough means of
	  protection against determined malicious users. There are specialized
	  utilities specifically designed to crack the RC4 WEP encryption
	  algorithm protecting a wireless network and to expose the shared
	  key. <b> AirSnort </b> and <b> WEP
	  Crack </b> are two such specialized applications. To protect
	  against this, administrators should adhere to strict policies
	  regarding usage of wireless methods to access sensitive
	  information. Administrators may choose to augment the security of
	  wireless connectivity by restricting it only to SSH or VPN
	  connections, which introduces an additional encryption layer above the
	  WEP encryption. Using this policy, a malicious user outside of the
	  network that cracks the WEP encryption has to additionally crack the
	  VPN or SSH encryption which, depending on the encryption method, can
	  employ up to triple-strength 168-bit DES algorithm encryption
	  (3DES), or proprietary algorithms of even greater
	  strength. Administrators who apply these policies should restrict
	  plain text protocols such as Telnet or FTP, as passwords and data can
	  be exposed using any of the aforementioned attacks.
	  </p></p> <div><h2>  A.1.4. Network Segmentation and DMZs</h2><p>  For administrators who want to run externally-accessible services
	  such as HTTP, email, FTP, and DNS, it is recommended that these
	  publicly available services be physically and/or logically segmented
	  from the internal network. Firewalls and the hardening of hosts and
	  applications are effective ways to deter casual intruders. However,
	  determined crackers can find ways into the internal network if the
	  services they have cracked reside on the same logical route as the
	  rest of the network. The externally accessible services should reside
	  on what the security industry regards as a <i> demilitarized
	  zone </i> (DMZ), a logical network segment where inbound
	  traffic from the Internet would only be able to access those services
	  and are not permitted to access the internal network. This is
	  effective in that, even though a malicious user exploits a machine on
	  the DMZ, the rest of the Internal network lies behind a firewall on a
	  separated segment.</p></div> <p><p>  Most enterprises have a limited pool of publicly routable IP
	  addresses from which they can host external services, so
	  administrators utilize elaborate firewall rules to accept, forward,
	  reject, and deny packet transmissions. Firewall policies implemented
	  with  or dedicated hardware firewalls allow
	  for complex routing and forwarding rules, which administrators can use
	  to segment inbound traffic to specific services at specified addresses
	  and ports, as well as allow only the LAN to access internal services,
	  which can prevent IP spoofing exploits. For more information about
	  implementing , refer to <a href="ch-fw.html" target="_blank"> Chapter 7  </a><i> Firewalls </i>.
