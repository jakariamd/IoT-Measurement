In any case, when the data transfer is not necessary for the execution of the payment transaction or any other purpose as provided in this Policy, Segpay will inform you of the purpose of processing and the identity of the potential third parties so that you may permit or refuse the transfer depending on its purpose. In general, the third-party providers used by Segpay will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us and the merchant.

Segpay does not sell or rent your personal data.</p></div> <div><h3>  6. Where is your data kept?</h3><p>  Your personal information may be transferred outside of your country or region (such as the European Economic Area), to other countries including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. This could happen if you make a purchase at a merchant that is not based within your country or region or if any third party Segpay uses is based outside of your country or region. For any US non-residents: If you are accessing the Service, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where Segpay’s servers are located and Segpay’s central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. To comply with EU data protection laws around international data transfer, Segpay only allows third parties outside the European Economic Area to process your personal data if they apply the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (Article 46.2(c) GDPR). For more information on where and how the relevant document may be accessed or obtained, please contact us. By using Segpay’s services, you acknowledge that your information may be transferred to Segpay’s facilities and those third parties with whom Segpay shares it as described in this Policy.</p></div> <p><p>  Appropriate safeguards. Segpay will take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your personal information remains protected to the standards described in this Policy. Segpay’s affiliated companies in the US are bound to Standard Contractual Clauses. For any other third parties, Segpay will either ensure that: (i) the transfer is permitted as their country of residence is designated by competent authorities as providing an adequate level of protection, similar to your rights under European data protection legislation; or (ii) other sufficient measures are put in place to ensure that such third party provides the appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses which shall include the ability for you to exercise your rights as set forth in the next section 7. As part of such appropriate safeguards, such parties that receive your personal information (if you pay with card) will at all times adhere to the Payment Card Information Data Security Standards as set by the card schemes.</p></p> <div><h3>  7. What rights do you have about how Segpay uses and discloses your information?</h3><p>  Segpay provides you the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding its collection, use, and sharing of your personal information at all times. In accordance with local law, your controls and choices include all of the following: access your personal information, rectification or erasure (right to be forgotten) of personal information and objection to such processing. Further, you retain the right to request restriction of processing (if for instance you objected to our processing or you contest the accuracy of the personal information).</p></div> <p><p>  Finally, you may also contact Segpay and exercise your right to data portability. This means you may receive your personal information which you have provided to Segpay, giving you the right to transmit this to a third party, provided that the processing by Segpay has been carried out by automated means and such transfer is technically feasible (right to data portability).</p></p> <p><p>  Specific to Segpay’s profiling activities, please note your right to object thereto. However, any decisions made on your (risk) profile are not solely based on automated processing. If this is the case though, you retain the right to not be subject to such decisions solely based on automated processing.</p></p> <p><p>  Segpay will inform you about any rectification or erasure of your personal information or restriction of processing carried out pursuant to your request. In the event Segpay does not conform to your request, for justifiable reasons, Segpay will inform you without delay and clarify the reasons for not taking action.

Segpay encrypts all payment transactions using TLS technology as required by PCI standards.</p></div> <p><p>  No Security Guarantees. The transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure.

Nor does Segpay guarantee against all unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction of personal information.</p></p> <div><h3>  10. Data Retention</h3><p>  Your personal information will not be stored longer than necessary for the provision of the Service to the merchant or to you and for as long as required by applicable law. The exact retention period is determined on the basis of the following criteria: the continued use by you of the Service for any other trials or subscriptions you select from merchants and to provide you with support for any future purposes (for instance for new trials or subscriptions of merchants). Segpay’s retention of your personal information will ensure a continuous and improved use of the Service and your management of trials and subscriptions history. In order to comply with applicable anti-money laundering (AML) laws, we are required to hold transaction records, including your personal information, also after the business relationship with the merchant has ended. You maintain the right to require erasure of your personal information. If you exercise your right to erasure, we will assess which data is required to ensure AML compliance. Any other data will be deleted.</p></div> <div><h3>  11. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3><p>  Segpay will post any changes it makes to this policy on this page.
