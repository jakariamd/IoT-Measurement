                        When more than one (1) digital photo frame is added to cart, a checkbox will appear on the cart slider/cart page.
                    </p><p>  
                        This option will allow you to order 2 or more frames and send them to different locations at the same time through the same checkout experience without having to enter different shipping addresses one by one.
                    </p></div> <p><p>  <b> The multi-shipping option is not showing up / greyed out. Why is that? </b></p></p> <div><p>  
                        This can happen due to 3 reasons:
                    </p><ul>  <li>When only one (1) digital photo frame is added to cart.</li><li>When a print store product is added to cart. Please note print products are not supported for delivery through multi-shipping and need to be ordered separately.</li><li>When Nixplay Plus subscription is added to cart together with more than one (1) digital photo frame.</li></ul><p>  
                            At this step, the multi-shipping option will show as “Not applicable - Learn More”. To avoid this:
                        </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Simply purchase the Nixplay Plus subscription separately first and activate your account.</li><li>Next login to your account directly at Nixplay store and enjoy 25% off the digital photo frames and you will notice the multi-shipping option is now available.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <b> Why can’t I order both the Nixplay Plus subscription and use multi-shipping option at the same time? </b></p><p>  
                        This is because the multi-shipping option cannot recognize subscription-based products and therefore the Nixplay Plus subscription needs to be ordered separately. 
                    </p><p>
