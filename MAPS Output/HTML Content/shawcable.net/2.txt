Frequently Asked Questions </h3></div> <div><h4>   3.1 What type of Personal Information does Shaw collect? </h4></div> <div><h4>  3.1.1 Customer's Personal Information:</h4><p>  <strong> General: </strong> If you wish to obtain any of Shaw's products and/or services, Shaw will collect information about you when you subscribe for any of these products and/or services. The type of information we collect varies based on the service you have requested. The Personal Information most often collected and maintained in a Customer file may include (but is not limited to) name, address for service, mailing address, phone number(s), a piece of acceptable identification, alternate contact information, banking information for payment, non-Shaw email address (i.e. if you are an eBill user or if you are a Shaw Direct customer subscribing to one of our newsletters), credit card information for payment, credit rating/score. In order to conduct credit checks, we will collect one or more of the following: driver's license number, Social Insurance number, credit card number and/or date of birth. If we need to know about your credit history we may also receive information from third parties.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Collection and Use of Television Set-Top Box Data: </strong> Certain digital set-top boxes used by Customers who subscribe for video services, and the FREERANGE TV mobile app, automatically collect raw household tuning data (the "Tuning Data"). Tuning Data is used for billing purposes, diagnostic purposes, for the tuning of recommendation engines and to measure television viewership. Shaw creates a database of anonymized and/or aggregated viewing behaviour by pairing Tuning Data with non-sensitive information in Customer files. This helps Shaw understand Customer reactions to television content and advertising. The collection of Tuning Data is critical to operating our video services and cannot be disabled. However, you can choose to opt-out of Shaw's use of Tuning Data in an anonymized and aggregated database by using the process described in Subsection 3.3 below. You can also disable the delivery of recommendations via your set-top-box settings.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Collection and Use of Personal information in connection with Shaw Go WiFi: </strong> In order to access Shaw Go WiFi, you will be requested to provide your Shaw User ID, password and certain other information that may be requested from time to time. Shaw will also automatically collect certain information such as device location, device type, and general usage information associated to the Media Access Control (“MAC”) address associated with your device (the “Device Information”). The Device Information is used to deliver the Shaw Go WiFi service, monitor and improve network traffic, improve your Customer experience and for research and statistical purposes. Shaw may from time to time use the Device Information to deliver advertising to the browser you are using to access the Internet as outlined in our Terms of Use for Shaw Go WiFi. In certain instances, Shaw will rely on a third party to deliver Shaw Go WiFi services at a specified location (for example, certain airports, universities or other locations). The relationship with the third party is governed by strict privacy provisions, in compliance with PIPEDA. As part of the delivery of the Shaw Go WiFI services, the third party may have access to the Device Information, which can only be used for limited network monitoring and improvement purposes.</p></p> <div><h4>  3.1.2 Web Site User Personal Information</h4><p>  The Personal Information that may be collected in relation to Web Site Users through an online form typically includes (but is not limited to) name, phone number, email address.</p><p>  <strong> Collection and Use of anonymous web information through the use of Cookies: </strong> During a Web Site User’s interaction with one of Shaw's websites, Shaw may use a browser feature called a "cookie" to collect information anonymously and track user patterns on Shaw's websites. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies a Web Site User’s browser – but not the Web Site User personally – to Shaw's computers each time a Web Site User visits one of the Shaw websites using cookies. Cookies tell Shaw which pages of its websites are visited and how many people visited each web page. This helps Shaw understand consumer interests and enhance the on-line experience of visitors to the Shaw websites. Cookies also serve to identify your computer so that your preferences can be saved for future visits and advertising displayed based on your previous interaction with the site. and Shaw works with third parties that use these cookies to help us with such traffic management, research and analytics.</p></div> <p><p>  The use of cookies is an industry standard and many major browsers are initially set up to accept them. You can reset your browser to either refuse to accept all cookies or to notify you when you have received a cookie. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features available on Shaw's websites.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Third Party Cookies and Advertisements: </strong> Some of the advertisements you see on the Shaw websites are delivered by third party advertisers, Internet advertising companies that work on Shaw's behalf or ad networks. These third parties may use cookies or other technology to help deliver ads that are tailored to your interests and track their performance. This is commonly known as "behavioural" or "interest-based advertising".</p></p> <p><p>  You can opt-out of several third-party ad servers' and networks' cookies simultaneously using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative located at <a href="//www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"> http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp </a>. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and usage patterns.</p></p> <div><h4>   3.2 Why does Shaw collect and use Personal Information? </h4></div> <div><h4>  3.2.1 Customer Personal Information</h4><p>  Shaw collects and uses Customer's Personal Information for the following purposes, to:</p><p>  a)	establish and maintain a responsible commercial relationship with you; b)	for research and statistical purpose, to understand your needs as a Customer and your eligibility for products and services; c)	recommend particular products, services and opportunities to you. d)	provide information to you about developments and new products; develop, enhance and market products and services and/or provide products and services to its Customers; e)	process billing and collect fees for the Shaw products and services you have purchased and/or subscribe to; f)	perform or order credit checks; g)	deliver to you the products, services and third-party applications included in your subscription, including providing you with the programming content and advertising corresponding to your postal code; h)	to administer and manage our business and operations, including the protection of the security and integrity of our services and our website; i)	provide customer support; and j)	meet Shaw's legal and regulatory requirements.</p></div> <div><h4>  3.2.2 Web Site Users Personal Information</h4><p>  Shaw collects and uses Web Site User's Personal Information for purposes generally identified on the Shaw website at the time of collection.
