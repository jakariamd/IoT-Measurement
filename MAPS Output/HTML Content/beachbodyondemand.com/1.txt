	This Privacy Policy applies whenever we collect information from or about you when you visit, access, use or otherwise interact with any of our websites, mobile or device applications, equipment interfaces, content, products, services, software, technology and any other materials (including when you make a purchase, stream content, use our products, goods or services, take part in promotions, contact us, or otherwise interact with us) (collectively, “<b> Services </b>”). Some of this information may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” and some of which may be considered “sensitive,” under various applicable laws.</p></div> <p><p>  
	This Privacy Policy also applies to information we may receive from our parent and affiliated companies in connection with providing Services to you.</p></p> <p><p>  
	This Privacy Policy applies to any person or entity providing personal information to us, including customers, Preferred Customers who are members of the Preferred Customer Club and receive exclusive benefits such as product discounts; and BODi Partners (each, a “<b> Partner </b>”) who are members of the <a href="" target="_blank"> BODi </a> community and help others succeed with their health and wellness goals by selling BODi products and services.</p></p> <div><p>  What Information Is Collected About You Through BODi Services?</p><p>

If we combine non-personal information with personal information, then we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.</span></div> <p><p>

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie is a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device and can contain other information as well. We use cookies to recognize your device, store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide internet-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze our products, and perform and fulfill other legitimate purposes.</p></div> <p><p>         <u> Pixel Tags </u>: Certain Services and websites contain electronic images known as pixel tags (also called web beacons or gifs) that we use to help deliver and recognize cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include pixels in our emails to tell if you open and act on them.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Embedded Scripts: </u> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Mobile device IDs: </u> Our mobile apps may use device IDs to help conduct analytics and deliver ads. Apple and Android-based and other mobile devices may generate a mobile advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites.</p></p> <div><p>  Third Party Advertising and Analytics Providers and Similar Third Parties</p><p>  
	The Services include pixel tags and cookies and mobiles IDs from third parties (such as analytics companies, network advertisers, ad agencies, and others) who provide us with information about the Services, users, and our advertisements, and who serve our advertisements on the Services and elsewhere online. In some cases, a third party uses cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, third parties use cookies and pixel tags or mobile IDs to track interaction with and the effectiveness of content and advertising (such as videos, news content) and target ads to you. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content or pixel tags, that third party is able to set or read its own tracking technologies (including cookies and web beacons) on your device and otherwise use those technologies to collect or have access to information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. We may also share (or permit third parties to collect) certain information, such as Usage Information, aggregated, de-identified, pseudonymized, or hashed information (including email addresses), with these third parties for similar purposes.</p></div> <div><p>  
	Here are ways you can opt-out of and/or control the tools described above:</p><p>         <u> Opt-out </u> To opt-out from third party collection or use of cookie data for online advertising purposes, please navigate to the bottom of our website, click the “Do Not Sell My Info” hyperlink, turn on the toggle switch and click “Save.” Please note, if you use different computers or browsers, you may need to indicate your opt-out choices again on those computers and browsers.</p><p>         <u> Industry opt-out </u> Many of these companies are also members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:</p></div> <div><p>     United States:</p><p>     Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (<a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank"> https://youradchoices.ca/ </a>)</p><p>         <u> Browser cookie controls </u><u> :  </u>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p></div> <p><p>         <u> Pixel </u><b> Tag Controls </b> You can disable pixel tags in emails by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Mobile Ad ID controls </u> Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.

You may opt-out from interest-based advertising on your mobile device through your mobile device settings.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Google Analytics: </u> We may also use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the site and provide other reports. This service may also collect information regarding your use of other websites, apps, and online resources.

Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals, except as specifically required by law. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank"> http://www.allaboutdnt.com/ </a>.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Global Privacy Control: </u> Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking.

	We share personal information we collect as described below:</p><p>         <u> Third-Party Service Providers </u> We disclose any of the categories of personal information described in this policy to third party companies and individuals for business purposes performed on our behalf to better serve you. For example, we use third parties to help us make our products and services available to you, fulfill orders you may have placed, process credit card payments, provide customer service, ship postal mail, deliver your packages, conduct market research or information analysis, manage promotions, and contact you in connection with various BODi Services. In these instances, we may need to provide your information to these third parties for such purposes.</p></div> <p><p>         <u> Customers, Preferred Customers and the BODi Community </u> To maximize the benefits of our products and services, we assign an independent BODi Partner to all customers and Preferred Customers who purchase a product through BODi or who consent to be contacted by a Partner. Your assigned Partner is available to assist you in understanding and using the products you ordered, and help give you the motivation you need to help you achieve your fitness goals. To help you both get in contact and for other business purposes, we may disclose to your assigned Partner certain information you provided during your purchase process, such as your contact information (your name, address, phone number, email address) and transaction history and order information. Your Partner may contact you to offer support, and provide general information and marketing materials. Please note that BODi will never provide your assigned Partner your credit or debit card information or, if you provided it, your Social Security number/Social Insurance number. Customers and Preferred Customers may opt-out of further sharing their information with Partners </p></p> <span><span>   by visiting their Preference Center which is accessible through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from BODi.</span></span> <p><p>         <u> Partners and the BODi Community </u> Individuals who join the BODi community as a Partner are joining a business to help others succeed with their health and wellness goals. As part of that mission, Partners will have access to certain information of certain other Partners to help them engage and collaborate with other Partners and grow their business. This includes information such as name, address, phone number, e-mail address, transaction history and order information, and Partner-related sales, performance, volume, and team information (upline and downline). Partners may opt-out of further sharing information with their upline Partners by visiting their Preference Center which is accessible through links at the bottom of e-mails you receive from BODi.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Customers, Preferred Customers, Partners and the BODgroups Community </u> To assist individuals through their health and wellness journey, many of our Partners run engaging groups through our community-based platform known as BODgroups, which help their participants stay motivated, accountable, and supported to achieve lasting results. If you join a BODgroup, then the Partner(s) running the group will have access to certain information you provide through BODgroups, such as your name, email, goal, and workouts and supplement intake. If you enabled sharing, then you can also share your activity, progress photos and body measurements with your Partner. If you post a message or picture within the group, then other participants in the group can also see your post. You are always free to stop sharing certain information through the Privacy tab within your group.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> Parent, Affiliates and Subsidiaries </u>Since BODi supplies products and services that may be used in connection with equipment and services provided by our affiliated and subsidiary companies, BODi may share information with those companies (such as, by way of example, with our subsidiary company Myx Fitness, LLC when you purchase a Myx fitness bike, and related BODi companies). In these cases, your information may be accessible to these related companies and used for business, operational, and marketing purposes in accordance with each of those entities’ privacy policies.</p></p> <div><p>         <u> When You Agree to Receive or Direct Us to Share Your Information </u></p><span>   We may share information when you direct us to do so. For example, you may choose to take advantage of third-party warranty, financing or other offers, or integrate third party services with the Services; or engage with social media features or other third-party applications or features. In each of these instances, information about you and/or your transactions may be shared. Please note that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you must contact that third party directly.</span></div> <p><p>         <u> Administrative and Legal Reasons; Protection of BODi and Others </u>We may share your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of BODi, or the legal rights of our customers, Partners, business partners, employees, agents, and contractors; (ii) protect the safety and security of our customers, Partners or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) detect and protect against fraud and identity theft or to conduct risk management; (iv) comply with laws, legal process, or legal requests from any governmental or regulatory body; or (v) to enforce or apply our website Terms and Conditions and/or other agreements.</p></p> <p><p>         <u> De-identified or Pseudonymized Data Disclosures </u> We may also disclose de-identified or pseudonymized information, such as aggregated or hashed information with third parties in our discretion (such as business partners, advertisers, and others) and as allowed by law, including for targeted advertising purposes. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized data as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed under applicable law.</p></p> <div><p>  What About Third-Party Content and Links</p><p>  
	At various points and pages on our websites or mobile applications, you may be able to access or utilize services offered by or in conjunction with third parties. This includes services in connection with third-party "social media" and other sites that would allow personal information to be transferred to such third parties (for example, Facebook Connect), Partners, and others. In addition, certain purchases that you make through the BODi Services may be completed by or through our authorized reseller (“Reseller”), such as Apple or Google. You will be required to provide your personal information to the Reseller who will charge your payment card or other payment method for any BODi products or services you wish to purchase. When this happens, we will notify you of the name of the Reseller or it will be apparent, and you will see their terms and conditions and privacy policy for your review.</p></div> <p><p>  
	These third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, so please review their privacy policies to understand your rights. For this reason, BODi cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy practices.</p></p> <div><p>  How Secure is Information About Me?</p><p>  
	BODi has implemented and uses reasonable security measures designed to help prevent the loss and unauthorized access of your information. Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or our online services.

You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity.
