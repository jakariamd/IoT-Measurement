For example, your PlayStation username will be displayed on leaderboards if you are a top player in a certain Activision game, whether or not you have an Activision account. If you have synced a third party account with your Activision account, we, or our third party partners or licensees, may make your username available to be searched by other users if you have not opted out of this feature. You may unlink the third party account or prevent it from being searched or your information from being shared with third party partners or licensees at any time through your Activision profile settings.    </p></p> <p><p>  To provide fair gaming experience to all players, Activision uses anti-fraud, anti-cheat, and anti-toxicity technologies to prevent any cheating and bad behavior in our games.

In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information.
