<div><h1>  Privacy & Terms</h1><ul>  <li>Privacy Policy</li></ul></div> <div><h1>  Google Privacy Policy</h1><p>  When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</p><p>  This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.</p><p>  Privacy Checkup</p><p>  Looking to change your privacy settings?</p></div> <div><h2>  Contents</h2><p>  We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p><ul>  <li>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</li><li>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</li><li>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps</li></ul><p>  You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p></div> <p><p>  To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for <a href="privacy/key-terms?gl=US&hl=en-US#key-terms" target="_blank"> key terms </a>. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/policies?p=privpol_privts&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> contact us </a>.</p></p> <div><h1>  Information Google collects</h1><p>  We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p><p>  We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-useful-ads" target="_blank"> ads you’ll find most useful </a>, <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-people-online" target="_blank"> the people who matter most to you online </a>, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p></div> <p><p>  When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-unique-id" target="_blank"> unique identifiers </a> tied to the browser, application, or <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-device" target="_blank"> device </a> you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.</p></p> <p><p>  When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-personal-info" target="_blank"> personal information </a>.</p></p> <div><h2>  Things you create or provide to us</h2><p>  When you create a Google Account, you provide us with <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-personal-info" target="_blank"> personal information </a> that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-phone-number" target="_blank"> phone number </a> or <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-payment-info" target="_blank"> payment information </a> to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.</p></div> <p><p>  We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p></p> <div><h2>  Information we collect as you use our services</h2></div> <div><h3>  Your apps, browsers & devices</h3><p>  We collect information about the apps, browsers, and <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-devices" target="_blank"> devices </a> you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.</p><p>  The information we collect includes <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-unique-id" target="_blank"> unique identifiers </a>, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-ip" target="_blank"> IP address </a>, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-referrer-url" target="_blank"> referrer URL </a> of your request.</p></div> <p><p>  We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-android-device" target="_blank"> Android device with Google apps </a>, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9021432?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> device type and carrier name </a>, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> other information about how you’re using your Android device </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  Your activity</h3><p>  We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:</p><ul>  <li>Terms you search for</li><li>Videos you watch</li><li>Purchase activity</li><li>People with whom you communicate or share content</li><li>Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</li><li>Chrome browsing history you’ve <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-chrome-sync" target="_blank"> synced with your Google Account </a></li></ul></div> <p><p>  If you use our <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-calls-messages" target="_blank"> services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages </a>, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.</p></p> <p><p>  You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.</p></p> <div><h3>  Your location information</h3><p>  We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your general location.</p><p>  Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p><ul>  <li>GPS and other <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-sensor-data" target="_blank"> sensor data from your device </a></li><li>Activity on Google services, such as your searches and places you label like home or work</li><li><a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-near-device" target="_blank"> Information about things near your device </a>, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices</li></ul></div> <p><p>  The types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_location&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> turn your Android device’s location on or off </a> using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_lochistory&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Location History </a> if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about <a href="technologies/location-data?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> how we use location information </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-sources" target="_blank"> publicly accessible sources </a>. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google’s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-against-abuse" target="_blank"> protect against abuse </a>. We also receive information from advertising partners to provide <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-ad-services" target="_blank"> advertising and research services on their behalf </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  We use various technologies to collect and store information, including <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-cookies" target="_blank"> cookies </a>, <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-pixel" target="_blank"> pixel tags </a>, local storage, such as <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-browser-storage" target="_blank"> browser web storage </a> or <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-application-data-cache" target="_blank"> application data caches </a>, databases, and <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-server-logs" target="_blank"> server logs </a>.</p></p> <div><h1>  Why Google collects data</h1><p>  We use data to build better services</p><p>  We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p></div> <div><h3>  Provide our services</h3><p>  We use your information to <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-deliver-services" target="_blank"> deliver our services </a>, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p></div> <div><h3>  Maintain & improve our services</h3><p>  We also use your information to <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-ensure-working" target="_blank"> ensure our services are working as intended </a>, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-make-improvements" target="_blank"> make improvements </a> to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p></div> <div><h3>  Develop new services</h3><p>  We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p></div> <div><h3>  Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3><p>  We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-customized-search" target="_blank"> customized search results </a>. For example, <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Security Checkup </a> provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p></div> <p><p>  Depending on your settings, we may also show you <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-personalized-ads" target="_blank"> personalized ads </a> based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in <a href="https://myadcenter.google.com?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> My Ad Center </a>.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-sensitive-categories" target="_blank"> sensitive categories </a>, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li><li>We don’t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.</li><li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  Measure performance</h3><p>  We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-link-info" target="_blank"> link information </a> about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.</p></div> <div><h3>  Communicate with you</h3><p>  We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p></div> <div><h3>  Protect Google, our users, and the public</h3><p>  We use information to help improve the <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-safety-reliability" target="_blank"> safety and reliability </a> of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-the-public" target="_blank"> the public </a>.</p><p>  We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-detect-abuse" target="_blank"> detect abuse </a> such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-algorithm" target="_blank"> algorithms </a> to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p></div> <p><p>  We may <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-combine-info" target="_blank"> combine the information we collect </a> among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-other-sites" target="_blank"> your activity on other sites and apps </a> may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p></p> <p><p>  If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p></p> <p><p>  We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <div><h1>  Your privacy controls</h1><p>  You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p><p>  This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?utm_source=pp&utm_medium=Promo-in-product&utm_campaign=pp_body&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Privacy Checkup </a>, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our <a href="technologies/product-privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> Product Privacy Guide </a>.</p></div> <div><h2>  Managing, reviewing, and updating your information</h2><p>  When you’re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use. For example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you’ve saved with Google.</p><p>  We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account. Your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Google Account </a> includes:</p></div> <div><h3>  Privacy controls</h3></div> <div><h3>  Activity Controls</h3><p>  Decide what types of activity you’d like saved in your account. For example, if you have YouTube History turned on, the videos you watch and the things you search for are saved in your account so you can get better recommendations and remember where you left off. And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/54068?hl=en_US#zippy=%2Cinfo-about-your-browsing-and-other-activity-on-sites-apps-and-devices-that-use-google-services" target="_blank"> information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services </a>, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.</p></div> <div><h3>  Ad settings</h3><p>  Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-partner" target="_blank"> partner with Google </a> to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services <a href="privacy?gl=US&hl=en-US#footnote-rely-on-cookies" target="_blank"> rely on cookies to function properly </a>, for things like remembering your language preferences.</li><li>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect.

For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p><p>  When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_endorse&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting </a>.</p></div> <div><h2>  When Google shares your information</h2><p>  We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:</p></div> <div><h3>  With your consent</h3><p>  We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent.

It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.</p></div> <div><h3>  Browser web storage</h3><p>  Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.</p></div> <div><h3>  Cookies</h3><p>  A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about <a href="technologies/cookies?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> how Google uses cookies </a> and how Google uses data, including cookies, <a href="technologies/partner-sites?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> when you use our partners' sites or apps </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Device</h3><p>  A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.</p></div> <div><h3>  Google Account</h3><p>  You may access some of our services by signing up for a <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Google Account </a> and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password). This account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others. You can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.</p></div> <div><h3>  IP address</h3><p>  Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.</p></div> <div><h3>  Non-personally identifiable information</h3><p>  This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.</p></div> <div><h3>  Personal information</h3><p>  This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.</p></div> <div><h3>  Pixel tag</h3><p>  A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p></div> <div><h3>  Referrer URL</h3><p>  A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page. The Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.</p></div> <div><h3>  Sensitive personal information</h3><p>  This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</p></div> <div><h3>  Server logs</h3><p>  Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p><p>  A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:</p><ul>  <li> is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.</li><li> is the date and time of the query.</li><li> is the requested URL, including the search query.</li><li> is the browser and operating system being used.</li><li> is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Unique identifiers</h3><p>  A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p><p>  Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about <a href="technologies/cookies?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> how Google uses cookies </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be <a href="technologies/ads?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> managed </a> in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p></p> <div><h2>  Additional Context</h2></div> <div><h3>  ads you’ll find most useful</h3><p>  For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> about Google ads </a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> why you may see particular ads </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  advertising and research services on their behalf</h3><p>  For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.</p></div> <div><h3>  Android device with Google apps</h3><p>  Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions.

In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p></div> <div><h3>  devices</h3><p>  For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.</p></div> <div><h3>  ensure and improve</h3><p>  For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.</p></div> <div><h3>  ensure our services are working as intended</h3><p>  For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p></div> <div><h3>  Information about things near your device</h3><p>  If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_androidloc&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  legal process, or enforceable governmental request</h3><p>  Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/overview?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Transparency Report </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  make improvements</h3><p>  For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p></div> <div><h3>  may link information</h3><p>  Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics?p=privpol_data&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  our users</h3><p>  For example, to prevent abuse and increase transparency and accountability over our online content moderation practices, Google shares data about requests for removal of content from our services with Lumen, which collects and analyzes these requests to facilitate research to help Internet users understand their rights. <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/answer/12158374?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  partner with Google</h3><p>  There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_controlads&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  payment information</h3><p>  For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.</p><p>  We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_agereq&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  personalized ads</h3><p>  You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  phone number</h3><p>  If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_phone&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  protect against abuse</h3><p>  For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).</p></div> <div><h3>  publicly accessible sources</h3><p>  For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s AI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.</p></div> <div><h3>  rely on cookies to function properly</h3><p>  For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. <a href="technologies/cookies?gl=US&hl=en-US#types-of-cookies" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  safety and reliability</h3><p>  Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:</p><ul>  <li>Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</li><li>The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail?p=privpol_signinactivity&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></li></ul></div> <div><h3>  sensitive categories</h3><p>  When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy?p=privpol_p13nad&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> require the same from advertisers </a> that use our services.</p></div> <div><h3>  Sensor data from your device</h3><p>  Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.</p></div> <div><h3>  servers around the world</h3><p>  For example, we operate data centers located <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> around the world </a> to help keep our products continuously available for users.</p></div> <div><h3>  services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages</h3><p>  Examples of these services include:</p><ul>  <li>Google Voice, for making and receiving calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail</li><li>Google Meet, for making and receiving video calls</li><li>Gmail, for sending and receiving emails</li><li>Google Chat, for sending and receiving messages</li><li>Google Duo, for making and receiving video calls and sending and receiving messages</li><li>Google Fi, for a phone plan</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  show trends</h3><p>  When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. <a href="https://support.google.com/trends?p=privpol_about&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  specific Google services</h3><p>  For example, you can delete <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger?p=privpol_blog&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> your blog </a> from Blogger or <a href="https://support.google.com/sites?p=privpol_delete&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> a Google Site you own </a> from Google Sites. You can also delete <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay?p=privpol_review&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> reviews </a> you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.</p></div> <div><h3>  specific partners</h3><p>  For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. <a href="privacy/google-partners?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a> about these partners and how they use your information.</p></div> <div><h3>  synced with your Google Account</h3><p>  Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome?p=privpol_chrsync&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  the people who matter most to you online</h3><p>  For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you <a href="https://contacts.google.com?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> contact most frequently </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  the public</h3><p>  For example, we process information about <a href="https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?visit_id=637939486089565735-343938859&hl=en_US" target="_blank"> requests to remove content </a> from our services under Google's content removal policies or applicable law to assess the request, and to ensure transparency, improve accountability and prevent abuse and fraud in these practices.</p></div> <div><h3>  third parties</h3><p>  For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.</p></div> <div><h3>  U.S. state privacy laws</h3><p>  These laws include:</p><ul>  <li>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA);</li><li>Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA);</li><li>Colorado Privacy Act (CPA);</li><li>Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (CTDPA); and</li><li>Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Views and interactions with content and ads</h3><p>  For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.</p></div> <div><h3>  Voice and audio information</h3><p>  For example, you can choose whether you want Google to save an audio recording to your Google Account when you interact with Google Search, Assistant, and Maps. When your device detects an audio activation command, like “Hey Google,” Google records your voice and audio plus a few seconds before the activation. <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6030020?hl=en_US#zippy=%2Chow-audio-recordings-are-saved" target="_blank"> Learn more </a></p></div> <div><h3>  your activity on other sites and apps</h3><p>  This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US" target="_blank"> account settings </a> and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.</p></div> <p><p>  <a href="technologies/partner-sites?gl=US&hl=en-US" target="_blank"> Learn more </a> about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p></p> <div><label>  Change language:</label></div>
