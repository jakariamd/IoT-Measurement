The end page is part of the SurveyMonkey website. We may include our own <a href="/mp/legal/survey-research-privacy-notice/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline" target="_blank"> research surveys </a> and polling on this end page.

These cookies are used to ensure that the full functionality of our survey service is operational, to ensure the survey operates appropriately and optimally. For more information please read our <a href="/mp/legal/privacy/#cookies" target="_blank"> Cookies section below </a> and our <a href="/mp/legal/survey-page-cookies/?ut_source=legal&ut_source2=privacy&ut_source3=inline" target="_blank"> Respondent Cookies Notice </a>. After completion of a survey, in most cases, you will be re-directed to our website and treated as a website visitor where other cookies may be used so you should read our Website Visitor section if this is of interest to you.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Examples</li></ul><p>  We use page tags to allow the email sender (for a survey or form for example) to measure the performance of email messaging and to learn how to improve email deliverability and open rates. We also use cookies to ensure a respondent can only take a survey once (where the Creator has set this function) and to track completion rates of surveys.</p><ul>  <li>How you use our services.</li></ul><p>  We use information about how you use our services to improve our services for you and all users.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Examples</li></ul><p>  We collect information about the types of questions you answer. This data will be aggregated and deidentified so we can examine patterns in terms of respondent preferences when submitting responses (see further below in Information for Survey Respondent <a href="/mp/legal/privacy/#two-one-respondents" target="_blank"> section </a>). We collect and use all this data for our legitimate interests like helping us improve the experience for respondents (so that questions are easier to answer), for training purposes and to understand industry trends in and to help improve the completion rates on surveys/forms.</p></div> <p><p>  We will also use usage information such as the type of survey, form, questionnaire or application that you answered to personalize products we show you on completion of a survey when you are re-directed to our website and to make recommendations to our customers about usage of our services.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Device and browser data.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use device data both to troubleshoot problems with our service and to make improvements to it. We also may infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Other Examples</li></ul><p>  We collect this to ensure that service experience works well across all possible devices and to infer geographic location to produce aggregated data around Respondent location trends. We also want to use this information to provide an additional data layer to Creators so that they can filter responses by e.g. inferred geographic location. Note however, that we do not collect precise GPS co-ordinate location. We just infer location from IP address. Finally we will use this information to compare and look at trends on how our service operates and how you interact with surveys, on different browsers and devices.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Log data.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  We use log data for many different business purposes including the following:</p><ul>  <li>To monitor abuse and troubleshoot;</li><li>To create new services, features, content or make recommendations;</li><li>To track behavior at the aggregate/anonymous level to identify and understand trends in the various interactions with our services; and</li><li>To fix bugs and troubleshoot product functionality.</li><li>Examples</li></ul><p>  Your IP address is used to ensure that you do not complete the same survey, form, application or questionnaire twice if the creator has included settings to avoid this (ballot stuffing), for abuse monitoring purposes (so we can identify a Respondent who abused the survey taking experience in a manner contrary to our usage policies or to facilitate the Creator in complying with their own legal obligations). We also collect log data to collate aggregated data and metrics on activity at a non-identifying level and so that we can identify trends in survey taking over time.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Third parties and integrations.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We will collect and use information from third parties and integration partners to facilitate Creators in sending surveys/forms/applications/questionnaires to you.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Machine learning.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We will use machine learning techniques on response data, metadata (as described above) and cookie data, in order to provide Creators with useful and relevant insights from the data they have collected using our services, to build features, improve our services, for fraud detection and to develop aggregated data products. You can read more about this in relation to surveys below.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To manage our services we will also internally use your information and data, for the following limited purposes:</li><li>To enforce our agreements where applicable;</li><li>To prevent potentially illegal activities; and</li><li>To screen for and prevent undesirable or abusive activity. For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud.</li><li>Aggregated use cases.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In general survey responses are controlled and managed by the Creator (the person who sent or deployed that survey). But in limited instances SurveyMonkey may use data about Respondents in an aggregated, anonymous, or pseudonymous way. A Creator has some controls over how we use responses in their Account settings and may have turned off our ability to apply machine learning to responses where it is <a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Automatic-Insights" target="_blank"> linked to a specific product feature </a> in some cases.</p></p> <div><p>  The data impacted by this section includes:</p><ul>  <li>Survey type, question type and responses (at an aggregated and anonymized/pseudonymized level only)</li><li>Device data</li><li>Log data</li></ul><p>  <strong> SurveyMonkey will use automated processes and machine learning, to analyze survey responses, which in turn helps us to </strong>:</p><ul>  <li>Aggregate response data and activity:</li></ul><p>  We will do this so that we can identify trends, build product features that optimize responses, make product recommendations and provide guidance on which products and services work best in different scenarios.
