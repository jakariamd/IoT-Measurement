<div><h1>  Advertising Platform Privacy Policy</h1><p>  This policy explains how Magnite, Inc. (“Magnite,” we” or “us”) collects, uses and discloses information about you when you interact with Digital Media Properties (defined below) that use our advertising technology platforms and related services to deliver you ads (collectively, the “<strong> Services”) </strong>. </p><p>  Please note:This privacy policy does not govern (i) the collection and use of information about visitors to our website, <a href="https://www.magnite.com/" target="_blank"> https://www.magnite.com/ </a>, (ii) information collected in the course of our sales and marketing activities  – that information can be found <a href="https://www.magnite.com/legal/magnite-website-privacy-policy/" target="_blank"> here </a> (iii)  The activities of our affiliate SpringServe Inc. — that information can be found <a href="https://springserve.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"> here </a>  (iv) the collection, use and disclosure of information by our clients through their Digital Media Properties, which is governed by their own privacy policies and practices; or (iv) any activities where we act as a service provider to our clients rather than a data controller.  </p></div> <div><p>  <strong> About Us </strong></p><p>  Magnite provides Services that connect buyers of advertising inventory (advertisers) with sellers of advertising inventory (publishers) (in other words, the opportunity to display a buyer’s advertisement on a seller’s Digital Media Property).  In this policy, we refer to our buyers and sellers collectively as “<strong> clients </strong>”.</p><p>  For example, advertisers use our technology to buy inventory to display advertising across publishers’ websites and applications on Internet-connected devices and platforms, including mobile devices, computers and internet-connected TVs (which we collectively refer to as “<strong> Digital Media Properties </strong>”).</p></div> <p><p>  When an advertiser serves an advertisement on a publisher’s Digital Media Property, the advertisement will be displayed to you in connection with the content that you view. For example, if you visit a video-streaming Digital Media Property and click on a video that you want to stream, then an advertisement may appear before the video is shown because the advertiser successfully purchased the opportunity to display an advertisement before that video.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Information We Collect </strong></p><p>  When you visit a Digital Media Property that uses our Services, we collect certain information about you and your device (collectively, “<strong> User Information </strong>”). User Information does not include information that directly identifies an individual, such as name, address, phone number, or email address. However that information may be considered “personal data” or “personal information” under applicable privacy or data protection laws.</p></div> <p><p>  In particular, we collect identifiers such as your IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and device identifiers, and may also assign identifiers to your device based upon these identifiers and other device-related information we collect as described below. These identifiers help us to recognize a particular browser, computer, mobile device, Internet-connected television or other device without knowing the identity of the user of that device. We also collect information about the web page URL or app in which you are viewing content and other data that the Client makes available to us, which helps us, our clients, and our partners (such as third party advertising platforms) select appropriate advertisements to display to you.</p></p> <p><p>  When you visit Digital Media Properties that use our technology, we collect the following  information about you: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Usage Information: </strong>  including information about the domain, topic or name of the property, the date/time of visits, the search terms you enter, visitor activities and actions, viewability data, the video title, video player size, description or category being displayed, click data, types of advertisements viewed</li><li><strong> Log Information: </strong> including information about the type of browser you use, app version, access times, pages viewed, and the page you visited before navigating to the Digital Media Properties</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Device Information </strong>: including information about the computer or mobile device you use, including, device make, device model, device operating system, device operating system version, and data connection type;</li><li><strong> Location Information: </strong> We may derive the approximate location of your device from your IP address (geographic region or state). In accordance with your device permissions, we may also receive information about the precise location of your device but only if our clients pass it to us. Precise location may be deemed as sensitive personal information in some jurisdictions. Please see <a href="#Additional-Information-for-California-Residents" target="_blank"> Additional Information for California Residents </a>below to learn more about how we process sensitive personal information should it be passed to us; </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Internet service information </strong>: including information about which Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use; </li><li><strong> Deidentified information </strong>: We may process certain other deidentified data that enables us to serve you with advertisements, such as encrypted or hashed forms of your email address if our clients pass these to us;  </li><li><strong> Derived information </strong>: We may also receive information from third parties at the instruction or for the benefit of our clients that provide user demographics and information with respect to a user’s preferences, patterns, click and video interactions, behaviors or interests, as well as advertisers and advertising platforms that provide information to us in order to match an ad opportunity offered by our clients with the right advertisement.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Magnite and our clients may collect and store inferences about user activity using our Services.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> How We Collect User Information </strong></p><p>  We (and our service providers) use different technologies (collectively “Tracking Technologies”) to collect information, including cookies and other similar technologies to collect information automatically from your device when you visit with a Digital Media Property that uses our technology. </p><p>  Tracking Technologies help to match client’s advertising opportunities with the right advertisements. To do so, we may perform cookie syncing between publisher client cookies, Magnite cookies, third party data provider cookies and/or advertiser client cookies. This cookie synching process allows the parties to map their respective cookie information (for example, if publisher A sets a cookie on a user’s device with an ID 12345 and advertiser B sets a cookie on the same user’s device with an ID 67890, cookie synching would enable publisher A and advertiser B to recognize that ID 12345 and ID 67890 relate to the same user’s device). In the case of advertisers, the cookie sync may influence its decision to bid on advertising opportunities, because it may recognize that the cookie ID sent to it as an opportunity to bid on relates to a user they already know (perhaps because they already targeted advertising to the user when they previously visited a Digital Media Properties in the past).</p></div> <p><p>  We also use Tracking Technologies for frequency capping, i.e., to ensure that the same user is not served the same advertisement repeatedly, to assist with the delivery of ads, provide reporting to our Clients, and to understand and measure the user’s interactions with ads and their effectiveness.  </p></p> <p><p>  Please review our <a href="https://www.magnite.com/legal/platform-cookie-policy/" target="_blank"> Platform Cookie Statement </a> for more information.</p></p> <p><p>  Services provided by others: We also work with third-party for analytics and advertising services that separately collect and use User Information to enable our Clients and their customers to deliver targeted advertisements using our advertising technology. As an example, we work with third-party advertising companies that use information about your visits to various websites or applications across multiple devices in order to provide you with content and ads of interest across devices that they think are associated with you or your household, including web browsers, mobile apps, and internet-connected televisions. We, and our advertiser clients may use this third-party data in combination with the User Information we collect to deliver you targeted ads across multiple devices or our publisher clients may use this third-party data in combination with the User Information we collect to offer groupings of audiences, commonly known as audience segments, on the Digital Media Properties as advertising opportunities.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Use of User Information </strong></p><p>  We and our clients use User Information in order to inform their decisions regarding buying and selling advertising space on Digital Media Properties. In particular, we and  our clients use information we collect, in conjunction with other information they have independently collected or received from third-party advertising platforms, to deliver end users targeted advertising that our clients believe will be of particular interest to those users. This processing may constitute “targeted advertising” under some laws and the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information under other laws.

Advertisers may use this information in conjunction with other information they have independently collected to provide you targeted advertising and to help them evaluate whether a particular ad campaign may be of interest to you.</li><li><strong> Magnite Affiliates: </strong> We disclose User Information with other companies in the Magnite group of companies to use for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Business Transfers </strong>: We may disclose User Information in connection with an actual or proposed sale or transfer of all or a part of our business or assets, corporate merger, consolidation, or bankruptcy.</li><li><strong> Vital interest, legal rights and compliance with laws </strong>.
