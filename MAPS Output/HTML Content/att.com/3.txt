Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally among <a href="#" target="_blank"> AT&T affiliates </a></p><span>  Button Icon , such as DIRECTV and Cricket.

We may also combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.</span></div> <div><h5>  Sharing information with non-AT&T companies that provide services for us or for you</h5><p>  We share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing with our vendors for these purposes. We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.</p></div> <div><h5>  Sharing information with non-AT&T companies to enable Identity Verification</h5><p>  We may share information with non-AT&T companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. We do not allow those non-AT&T companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.

Reasons to share include:</p><ul>  <li>Complying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits. You can find out more about this in our <a href="https://about.att.com/csr/home/governance/transparency.html" target="_blank"> Transparency Report </a>.</li><li>Detecting and preventing fraud.</li><li>Providing or obtaining payment for your service.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Routing your calls or other communications.</li><li>Ensuring network operations and security.</li><li>Notifying, responding or providing information (including location) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.</li><li>Alerting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services. </li><li>Enforcing our legal rights, protecting our network and property or defending against legal claims.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Complying with legal requirements to share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services.

This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.</li></ul></ul> <div><h5>  Sharing Aggregate Metrics Reports with non-AT&T companies</h5><p>  Sometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to places where we provide Wi-Fi services.  In such cases, we aggregate the data before we use or share it with our business customers and service suppliers, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally. We require that these metrics reports only be used for aggregate insights and that no one attempt to identify any person or device using this information.  Consistent with this Policy, we also require that our metrics reports be handled in a secure manner and that the information included be used only for aggregate insights to enable the marketing or improvement of Products and Services.</p></div> <div><h5>  Sharing Aggregate Insights</h5><p>  We may share insights with non-AT&T companies about AT&T’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally).</p></div> <div><h5>  Sharing information for research</h5><p>  We may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information, and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.</p></div> <div><h5>  Sharing information with AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing programs</h5><p>  We may share information with AT&T affiliates and with non-AT&T companies to deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as described in Privacy Choices and Controls.</p></div> <div><h5>  Sharing information to support location services</h5><p>  Location services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the service. Location services may collect and use or share location information to power applications on your device (those that are pre-loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps, or other location services you subscribe to.  AT&T will not share your location information for location services without your consent (to us or a company providing you service), except as required by law. If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device company, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this Policy. In other cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.</p></div> <p><p>  You can manage your privacy choices about how we contact you and how we use or share your information. You also have choices about how certain non-AT&T companies and advertisers use your information, including how we use and share your information for advertising and marketing.</p></p> <div><h5>  Communication preferences</h5><p>  Sometimes we have offers or programs that may interest you.

                within

                left off, remember your registered username, preferences and other customizations.
</li></ul></div> <div><p>  There are a couple of important things to remember about cookies:

                    or

                    in
                    a user’s web browser. Local storage on
                    ATT.com is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from our domains. Local storage
                    data

</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Flash Cookies </b> (also called Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") are similar to cookies, except
            that they can store more complex data. They are used to remember your settings, preferences and usage,

            other similar services. Flash
            cookies allow functionality and availability of certain services. If disabled, these services may not

            like
            recording the pages and advertisements that users click on, or tracking how well an e-mail marketing
            campaign performs.</li><li>A <b> widget </b> is a small program or application that can be embedded in a web page. It can provide
            real-time information, such as stock quotes or weather reports. Widgets are often provided by a third

            improving web page performance and introducing new features. For example, it may record which search
            terms
            you’ve entered, or the links you’ve
