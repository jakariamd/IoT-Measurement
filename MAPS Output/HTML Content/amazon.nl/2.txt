Any person or entity that participates or attempts to participate in our associate marketing program (the “<strong> Associates Program </strong>” and such person or entity, “<strong> you </strong>”, or an “<strong> Associate </strong>”) must accept this Associates Program Operating Agreement (this “<strong> Agreement </strong>”) without change. By registering for or using the Associates Site, you agree to this Agreement, including the <a href="https://partnernet.amazon.nl/help/operating/policies" target="_blank"> Program Policies </a> (defined in Section 12), which are incorporated by reference (for example, our Associates Program Participation Requirements, Associates Program IP License, Associates Program Commission Income  Statement, and Associates Program Trademark Guidelines.) Please read them carefully.
</p></p> <div><h3>  1.Description of the Associates Program</h3><p>  When our customers click through or engage with the Special Links to purchase an item sold or services offered on the Amazon Site or take other actions, you can receive commission income for qualifying purchases, as further described in (and subject to the limitations in) the <a href="https://partnernet.amazon.nl/help/operating/policies" target="_blank"> Associates Program Commission Income Statement </a>. In order to facilitate your advertisement of these items or services, we may make available to you data, images, text, link formats, widgets, links, marketing content, and other linking tools, application program interfaces, Alexa functionality, and other information in connection with the Associates Program (“<strong> Program Content </strong>”). Program Content specifically excludes any data, images, text, or other information or content relating to product offerings on any site other than the Amazon Site.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.Associates Program Compliance Requirements</h3><p>  
You must promptly provide us with any information that we request to verify your compliance with this Agreement. </p><p>  
If you violate this Agreement, or if you violate terms and conditions of any other applicable Amazon marketing agreement, then, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to us, we reserve the right to permanently (to the extent permitted by applicable law) cease payment of (and you agree you will not be eligible to receive) any and all commission income otherwise payable to you under this Agreement, whether or not directly related to such violation without notice and without prejudice to any right of Amazon to recover damages in excess of this amount.   
</p></div> <div><h3>  3.Amazon Customers</h3></div> <div><h3>  4.Warranties </h3><p>  
We do not make any representation, warranty, or covenant regarding the amount of traffic or commission income you can expect at any time in connection with the Associates Program, and we will not be liable for any actions you undertake based on your expectations.
</p></div> <div><h3>  5.Identifying Yourself as an Associate</h3></div> <div><h3>  6.Term and Termination</h3><p>  
In addition, we may terminate this Agreement or suspend your account immediately upon written notice to you for any of the following: (a) you are in material breach of this Agreement, (b) you otherwise fail to cure within 7 days of our notice to you regarding any other breach of this Agreement (including any Program Policy); (c) we believe that we may face potential claims or liability in connection with your participation in the Associates Program; (d) your participation in the Associate Program has been used for deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; (e) we believe that our brand or reputation may be tarnished by you or in connection with your participation in the Associates Program; (f) we believe that we are or may become subject to tax collection requirements in connection with this Agreement or the activities performed by either party under this Agreement; (g) we have previously terminated this Agreement (or suspended your account) with respect to you or other persons that we determine are affiliated with you or acting in concert with you for any reason, or (h) we have terminated the Associates Program as we generally make it available to participants. For the avoidance of doubt and without limitation for purposes of the foregoing subsection (a) any violation of Section 5 and as specified in the Program Policies will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.</p></div> <p><p>  
We may hold accrued unpaid commission income for a reasonable period of time following termination to ensure that the correct amount is paid (for example, to account for any cancelations or returns). </p></p> <p><p>  
Upon any termination of this Agreement, all rights and obligations of the parties will be extinguished, including any and all licenses granted in connection with this Agreement, except that the rights and obligations of the parties under Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 of this Agreement and as specified in the Program Policies, together with any payable but unpaid payment obligations under this Agreement, will survive the termination of this Agreement.

You acknowledge and agree that (a) we and our affiliates may at any time (directly or indirectly) solicit traffic on terms that may differ from those contained in this Agreement, (b) we and our affiliates may at any time (directly or indirectly) operate sites or applications that are similar to or compete with your Site, (c) our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement, and (d) any determinations or updates that may be made by us, any actions that may be taken by us, and any approvals that may be given by us under this Agreement can be made, taken, or given in our sole discretion and are only effective if provided in writing by our authorized representative. </p></div> <p><p>  
You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our express prior written approval.

This Agreement incorporates, and you agree to comply with, the most up-to-date version of all policies, appendices, specifications, guidelines, schedules, and other rules referenced in this Agreement or and any other policies that apply to tools, subprograms and features made available to you under the Associates Program (“<strong> Program Policies </strong>”), including any updates of the Program Policies from time to time. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any Program Policy, this Agreement will control. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and your agreement with an Amazon affiliate under a separate affiliate marketing program that agreement will control with respect to such separate program. This Agreement (including the Program Policies) is the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Associates Program and supersedes all prior agreements and discussions.</p></p> <p><p>

Any information relating to Amazon or any of its affiliates that we provide or make accessible to you in connection with the Associates Program that is not known to the general public or that reasonably should be considered to be confidential is Amazon’s “<strong> Confidential Information </strong>” and will remain Amazon’s exclusive property. You will use Confidential Information only to the extent reasonably necessary for your performance under this Agreement and ensure that all persons or entities who have access to Confidential Information in connection with your account will be made aware of and will comply with the obligations in this provision. You will not disclose Confidential Information to any third party (other than your affiliates bound by confidentiality obligations) and you will take all reasonable measures to protect the Confidential Information against any use or disclosure that is not expressly permitted in this Agreement. This restriction will be in addition to the terms of any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement between the parties and will apply for the term of the Agreement and 5 years after termination. </p></p> <p><p>  
You and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between you and us or our respective affiliates. You will have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on our or our affiliates’ behalf. If you authorize, assist, encourage, or facilitate another person or entity to take any action related to the subject matter of this Agreement, you will be deemed to have taken the action yourself.
</p></p> <p><p>  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement will, or will be interpreted or construed to, induce or require any party hereto to act in any manner (including taking or failing to take any actions in connection with a transaction) which is inconsistent with or penalized under any U.S. laws, regulations, rules or requirements that apply to any party to this Agreement.</p></p> <div><h3>  13.Modification</h3><p>  

If you have concluded this Agreement with Amazon France Services SAS, or the Agreement has been assigned to Amazon France Services SAS, any future changes to this Agreement will be deemed to apply between you and Amazon France Services SAS, despite the remaining reference in Schedule 1 to Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l.</p></div> <div><h3>  SCHEDULES</h3><p>
