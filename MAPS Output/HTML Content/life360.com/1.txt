If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with our Services or is using our Products without your consent, please alert us immediately by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com" target="_blank"> privacy@life360.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  By enabling your child to create a member account and/or permitting your child to use the Products or Services, you expressly agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your child’s personal information as described herein.</p></p> <div><h4>  <strong> A. Setting up a Child Account </strong></h4><p>  If a parent wishes to add a member who is a child to our Services, we request the parent provide verifiable consent when required by COPPA, through one of several methods, such as by verifying the parent’s driver’s license or by submitting a parental consent form (available <a href="https://www.life360.com/pdf/consent.pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>) via mail or email.

By providing the Products to a child, you represent and warrant to Life360 that you consent to such child’s use of our Products and Services and further consent as a parent to enable and permit Life360’s collection and use of the information from the Products and Services used by the child as stated in this Privacy Policy and the <a href="https://www.life360.com/terms_of_use/" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a>. </p></div> <div><h4>  <strong> B.

The child’s profile information and location will be shared with other members of any Circle the child joins. Please note the child will be able to share his or her location with other members of that Circle and may exchange messages with those Circle members. <strong> You are responsible for monitoring your child’s account and location-sharing activity through our Products and Services and for blocking or permitting location-sharing features. </strong></p></div> <div><h4>  <strong> D.
