South Korea). Qualcomm Location Service may enable your device to determine its location more quickly and accurately – even when your device is unable to get a strong GPS signal. Qualcomm Location Service may also help your device conserve battery power when you use applications or services requiring location data. If you use location-enabled applications, your device may send its location to such application providers. Location information provided to application providers is governed by their terms and privacy policies. We recommend you refer to the terms and privacy policies of those application providers.</p></div> <p><p>  If your device includes Qualcomm Location Service, you must opt-in to enable it. If you do not opt-in to Qualcomm Location Service, your device will not benefit from the benefits from the service including slower location calculations and greater battery consumption when using location-based apps.</p></p> <p><p>  Qualcomm Location Service works by periodically downloading data to your device regarding the locations of nearby cellular towers and Wi-Fi access points. This data may be combined with data from the sensors on your device such as the gyroscope or accelerometer to help your device determine its location and conserve battery power.
Qualcomm Location Service periodically sends us a unique software ID, the location of your device (longitude, latitude and altitude, and its uncertainty) and nearby cellular towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, signal strength, and time (collectively, “Location Data”). As with any Internet communication, we also receive the IP address your device uses. We use the data we collect to help us evaluate, maintain, and improve the performance of our systems.</p></p> <p><p>  Qualcomm Location Service uses a variety of reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the data we collect. In addition, we do not permanently store Location Data with your software ID or IP address, nor do we attempt to personally identify users of Qualcomm Location Service. To evaluate, maintain and improve system performance, your software ID and IP address are associated with your Location Data for thirty days from receipt after which time it is permanently deleted. After removing IP addresses and software IDs, we aggregate the Location Data to create an anonymous database regarding the locations of cellular towers and Wi-Fi access points. We may retain and use the de-identified and/or anonymous data collected from Qualcomm Location Service for our business purposes. We do not sell (as that term is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act) the full IP address or unique software ID collected from Qualcomm Location Service; and we share personal data only under the limited circumstances described in this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are in the Republic of Korea, Qualcomm Location Service complies with the Location Information Protection Act (“Act”) and you are entitled to relevant rights under the Act. For questions or comments about our practices in Korea, please contact us at:</p></p> <p><p>  Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (Korea) YH

QTR may collect: (i) the names of the apps installed and/or running on the device, (ii) configuration information (such as make, model, operating system and version, firmware and versions, wireless carrier, mobile country code and network code, anonymous QTR software identifier, and chipset serial number (which does not identify you)), and (iii) device performance statistics (such as CPU, GPU, or modem performance).</p></div> <p><p>  QTR uses a variety of reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the data we collect. QTR typically uses Wi-Fi, but may, in limited circumstances, upload via your cellular network.</p></p> <p><p>  As with any internet connection, we will receive the IP address the device used to send us data and we use the IP address to help us evaluate, maintain, and improve the performance of our systems and to determine general location (such as country, state, city, or zip code, but not specific geolocation). If we determine that QTR has sent us any data not identified in this Policy that could be personal data, we promptly delete such data after receipt. Some versions of QTR also have the capability of collecting the device’s international mobile equipment identifier (IMEI), but this capability is not currently being used. If, in the future, we collect IMEI, it will be collected for disclosed, necessary purposes, and in accordance with all applicable data protection and privacy laws. Finally, some versions of QTR also have the ability to allow you to opt in to send device location data. If you opt in to send location data, we may periodically collect the location of your device to help us, for example, to identify areas with low wireless signal coverage.</p></p> <p><p>  We use the data QTR collects for the purposes described in this Policy, including to help us develop next generation mobile technologies to improve wireless performance, conserve battery power, develop advanced security, and improve our business operations. We do not sell (as that term is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act) the full IP address, unique software ID, or chipset serial number collected from QTR; and we share personal data only under the limited circumstances described in this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  QTR offers a choice to opt out of data collection in the Android settings menu under the heading, “Qualcomm Technologies Reporting”. Opting out will not negatively affect your device performance.
We retain the IP address for the purposes described in this Policy for up to ninety (90) days, after which we de-identify the IP address. The de-identified IP address and the other data collected by QTR are anonymous to us and we retain and use such data for our business purposes.</p></p> <div><h3>  Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service</h3><p>  The Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service (formerly “XTRA”) is a service offered by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. in the US and QT Technologies Ireland Limited in the European Economic Area (collectively “QTI”) to its original equipment manufacturer customers. The Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service reduces the time and power required for on-device location calculation. The Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service downloads to your device a data file from QTI containing the predicted orbits of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites. The Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service also uploads a small amount of data to us comprised of: a randomly generated unique software ID that is not associated to you or to other IDs, the chipset name and serial number, the Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service software version, the mobile country code(s) and network code(s) (allowing identification of country and wireless operator), the type of operating system and version, device make and model, the date and time of connection to the server, the time since the last boot of the application processor and modem, and a list of QTI software on the device.</p></div> <p><p>  As with any internet connection, we will also receive the IP address the device used to send us data. We use the data we collect to evaluate, maintain, and improve the performance of our systems and to determine general location (but not specific geolocation). We do not sell (as that term is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act) the full IP address, unique software ID, or chipset serial number, and we share personal data only under the limited circumstances described in this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service uses a variety of reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the data we collect.</p></p> <p><p>  We retain the IP address for up to ninety (90) days to evaluate, maintain, and improve the performance of our systems after which we de-identify the IP address. The de-identified IP address and the other data uploaded by Qualcomm GNSS Assistance Service is anonymous to us and we retain and use such data for our business purposes.</p></p> <div><h3>  Qualcomm Voice Assist (QVA)</h3><p>  QVA is an Android system app that helps your voice-enabled applications (e.g., voice assistants) recognize your voice commands. You may update QVA through the Google Play store. QVA is not supported on all devices or for all voice-enabled applications.</p><p>  When you first enable QVA, you may be asked to speak a few phrases or repeat a specific word (a “wake word”) to train QVA to recognize you from others by creating a template of your voice. QVA stores the template on your device to recognize when you are giving a command, such as “what is the weather today?” QVA uses the template to help determine it was you who spoke the command and, if confirmed, sends the wake word detection to your voice-enabled application. Your template is retained on your device and not collected or shared with others.</p></div> <p><p>  If you have granted permission to a voice enabled application, each time you speak the wake word, QVA may send a recording of it to the applicable voice enabled application.</p></p> <p><p>  To delete your template, follow the instructions of the applicable voice-enabled application. You can uninstall QVA updates through Google Play or in system settings. You can also disable QVA in the system settings. If you uninstall the QVA updates or disable QVA, your voice-enabled applications may not function properly.</p></p> <div><h3>  Related</h3><span>  Other Languages</span><p>  Qualcomm is enabling a world where everyone and everything can be intelligently connected.
