<div><h2>  ExpressVPN takes your privacy seriously</h2><p>  Our commitment to your privacy means we never keep sensitive information and eliminate both activity logs and connection logs. Our systems are built around <strong> NOT </strong> knowing how customers use our services. ExpressVPN cannot answer questions like “Which users were connected to a given IP address at a specific time?” or “Which users accessed a particular website?” because we simply never possess that data.</p><p>  Other VPN providers claim “no logs” on their privacy policies without going into much detail. Do they know if customers manage to use their apps successfully? Can they enforce a limit on simultaneous usage from more than eight devices?</p></div> <p><p>  If a provider claims to “know nothing” but won’t answer simple questions about what they specifically do or don’t know, then it would be reasonable to question their claims of “no logs.” Unfortunately, most providers lack transparency when it comes to what matters most to VPN users: your privacy.</p></p> <p><p>  To protect our customers’ privacy, ExpressVPN only keeps the bare minimum information required to operate a highly reliable VPN service at scale. For more details, please review ExpressVPN’s <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  In addition, we’ve engaged independent audit professionals to exhaustively examine our systems to confirm whether our VPN servers are in compliance with our privacy policy, including our policy of not collecting activity logs or connection logs. Our TrustedServer technology has also been audited to verify that it operates as we’ve described.</p></p> <div><p>  Learn more about the third-party reports surrounding our no-logs policy and TrustedServer:</p><ul>  <li><a href="/blog/kpmg-privacy-policy-cure53-trustedserver-audit/" target="_blank"> An audit by KPMG of our no-logs policy </a> (September 2022)</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  ExpressVPN supports the fight for digital rights</h2><p>  ExpressVPN is committed not only to providing a private VPN service to help people all over the world be more anonymous, but also to <strong> supporting the cause of privacy itself </strong>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Advocates for digital freedom</h3><p>  ExpressVPN is proud to support the following non-profit digital privacy advocacy groups financially:</p><p>  Privacy isn’t a privilege; it’s a universal human right.
