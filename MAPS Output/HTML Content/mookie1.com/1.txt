He puts it into his shopping basket. When he puts the book in the shopping basket the product code and quantity he wants to purchase (1) are stored as a cookie. Every time John adds or removes items from his basket the information in the cookie is updated accordingly. John decides not to purchase the book.</p><p>  After visiting some other websites, John comes back and sees his item is still in the shopping basket. The basket remembers what he placed inside throughout his browsing session, thanks to the cookie which was generated earlier. John goes through with the transaction, and purchases the book.</p></div> <p><p>  When John added the book to the shopping basket, a piece of code was generated. This piece of code is associated to the online shop, and can only be read by this shop.
</p></p> <p><p>  Today John is looking at a mobile provider website and checking out handsets and tariffs. At the bottom of the webpage is a small piece of code that used by an interest-based advertising company to log that John's computer has visited this page. </p></p> <p><p>  After visiting the page, John's computer is assigned a unique reference number, so that we never need to know anything about John as an individual.</p></p> <p><p>   When John visits a website his computer is recognised by the unique reference number.  Down the side of the page, adverts appear from the mobile provider website he visited earlier. This advertising is selected on the basis of the prior visit to that website. </p></p> <div><h3>  Example One</h3></div>
