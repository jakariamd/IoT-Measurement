Such legitimate interests will include where Poshmark sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, or where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention. Poshmark will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> A Legal Obligation. </strong> A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Poshmark to comply with a legal obligation.</li><li><strong> Consent. </strong> Finally, in certain situations Poshmark relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data, such as marketing communications.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> Sharing Your information </strong></p><p>  We share your Information with third parties in the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Business Partners, Affiliates, Advisors and Transfer Participants. </strong> We may share your Information with our channel partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, professional advisors (such as financial, insurance, legal accounting, or otherwise), joint ventures, or any other company, to fulfill obligations and requests, to deliver provide users information about Poshmark and other purposes in Poshmark’s sole discretion in its provision of the Services. Poshmark does not control how a business partner may use your Personal Information. Our business partners are responsible for managing the use of Personal information collected in these circumstances.

Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others.
