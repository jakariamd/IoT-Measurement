<strong> Privacy Shield Principles </strong>

                                Xperi self certifies and commits to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, as described
                                in our Privacy Shield Policy, but we no longer rely on those Frameworks for its
                                transfers of Personal Data from the European Union (“EU”), the European Economic Area
                                (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”) to the US. The following Xperi subsidiaries
                                participate with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework:

If other methods for resolution of complaints relating to personal data transferred under the Privacy Shield Framework fail, in limited circumstances, you may invoke a binding arbitration option before the Privacy Shield Panel. The appropriate statutory body with jurisdiction to investigate any claims against Xperi Inc. regarding possible unfair or deceptive practices and violations of laws or regulations covering privacy is the Federal Trade Commission. Instead, at this time, Xperi relies on legal mechanisms such as the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses or your consent (in limited circumstances) for such transfers. Onward Transfer Since we share Personal Data with vendors and/or third parties ("Processors") as specified above, we comply with the notice and choice principles as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable steps designed to confirm that the vendor and/or third party processes the Personal Data we transfer to it in a manner consistent with the obligations we have as a participant under the Privacy Shield Principles. When we use Processors to perform processing tasks at our direction and instruction, we require that the processors utilize one of the following: <ul><ul>  <li>Privacy Shield Certifications and compliance with the General Data Protection
                                    Regulations or another adequacy finding (when the Processor is outside of the EU or

                                    protection as Xperi to the Personal Data.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
                                In cases of onward transfer to Processors, we may be liable for damages if the third
                                party (Processor) fail to comply with their contractual obligations.

                                when we interact with you, you may be informed of our legal basis for processing your

                                In addition to the terms of our global Privacy Policy, Xperi wants Individuals with whom

                                located in the European Union and European Economic Area (collectively “EU”),
                                Switzerland (CH) and the United

                                applicable (“EU Privacy Terms”). These EU Privacy Terms apply to Xperi’s processing
                                Personal Data related to
                                identified or identifiable individuals located in the EU, Switzerland and the UK (“EU

<strong> Controlling Law: </strong>

                                During your interactions with us, the collection and processing of your EU Personal Data
                                will occur as provided
                                in and under the terms of our Privacy Policy, as modified or supplemented by these EU
                                Privacy Terms.
                                
                                The Xperi entity responsible for the processing of your EU Personal Data will depend on
                                the unique
                                circumstances of your interactions with us and applicable privacy rules, including as
                                from 25 May 2018, the
                                General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). Xperi has adopted internal
                                policies and implemented
                                measures to ensure that the applicable legal requirements are met and that your EU
                                Personal Data is processed
                                with respect and care using the appropriate technology.
                                
<strong> Legal Basis: </strong>

                                We will only process your EU Personal Data as permitted by applicable law and our
                                policies. Applicable law and
                                policies may require Xperi to have a “legal basis” for the processing of your Personal
                                Data. In many instances
                                when we interact with you, you may be informed of our legal basis for processing your EU
                                Personal Data as
                                described in these EU Privacy Terms. The applicable legal basis often depends on the
                                types of data and the
                                specific context in which it is processed. We typically rely on ‘legitimate interest,’
                                ‘consent,’ ‘contract
                                performance’ and ‘ legal compliance’ as our primary legal bases to process your Personal
                                Data.
