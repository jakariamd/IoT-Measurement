<div><h2>  tzulo</h2><span>  Legal</span><p>  Terms of Service, Acceptable Use, Privacy Policy</p><ul>  <li>1<strong> Fees and Billing. </strong>
</li><li>1.1<strong> Service Charges. </strong> Customer agrees to pay the monthly charges for Services and any set up and other charges indicated on the Service Order(s) or otherwise due hereunder (collectively, “Service Charges”). Service Charges do not include any applicable taxes, which may be billed to Customer in addition to the Service Charges. If a Service Order provides for deferred payment of set-up costs over time, Customer acknowledges that it is responsible for paying in full the remaining balance of such set-up costs in the event of any early termination of the Service Order or this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>1.2<strong> “Burst” Bandwidth.  </strong> Billing for connectivity beyond the committed level ("burst" bandwidth) will follow the "95th percentile" rule: Usage samples will be collected and sorted from highest to lowest and the top 5% discarded. The next highest sample (the 95th percentile number) will then be used as the basis in computing the charge for the month for bandwidth beyond the committed level. See “Addendum: Tzulo, Inc. Bandwidth Terms” for further details</li><li>1.3<strong> Billing and Payment Terms. </strong> Beginning on the date of commencement of the Services, as set forth in the Service Order or otherwise documented, Customer will be billed monthly in advance for the contracted Services; except for specified one-time additional Services ordered by Customer and for “burst” bandwidth, which will be billed after the end of the month. All Service Charges and other fees will be due in U.S. dollars within fifteen (15) days of the date of invoice, or on such other terms as Tzulo may require if Customer has not met the criteria for an unsecured net-15-day line of credit. Late payments will accrue interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1 ½%) per month or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower. If Customer fails to make payments when due and does not cure such failure within (10) days after receipt of written notice of the same pursuant to the terms hereof, Tzulo will consider  Customer in default of its payment obligations hereunder, may suspend service to Customer and require payment in advance of further Services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>1.4<strong> Unmetered Bandwidth.  </strong> Unmetered Bandwidth maintains a no commit gurantee on ports speeds for services. Unmetered Bandwidth services allow customers to burst to the 
full speed of the service port for short time periods, but not to have sustained usage that is greater then 95% metric of 30% of the port. ie a 100mb port cannot be utilized and sustained beyond 30megabits without upgrading 
service to a dedicaed or Burst Bandwidth model. ie a 1gigabit port cannot be utilized beyond 30% or 300mbs of sustained usage (95th metric) without upgrading bandwidth options with tzulo. Tzulo has the right to cap, rate limit,
 or traffic shape your service to comply with our needs to maintain a fair and acceptable usage amongst other customers on this shared service. Unmetered Service is not gurantee of any port speeds or performance metrics. It is 
the ability to burst without metering for compensation. Tzulo reserverse the right to terminate services with customers when it sees an undue burden on its network or its other customers. Unmetered service is a shared service with no gurantee of bandwidth, MB transfereed or other metrics of any kind.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>1.5<strong> Payment Methods. </strong> Tzulo requires all customers to make 
payment via one of the following methods but not limited to: Credit Card, Paypal, Bank Transfer ACH/Wire 
Transfer, or BTC direct payments at the time of service due date. Failure to pay for services due may result in 
disconnection and/or termination of services. All customers that have a single or multiple services that equal 
to or greater then $5000/month will incur a 3% processing fee for all credit card/paypal transactions. It is the 
responsibility of the buyer to pay for services without fees to be paid by tzulo for services rendered. Payments

In the event Customer violates the Tzulo Acceptable Use Guidelines where Tzulo determines in its reasonable discretion that there is potential harm to its Network or business, Tzulo shall have the right to immediately suspend Service. In other cases of violation of the Tzulo Acceptable Use </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>1.<strong> Illegal Use.  </strong>Customer will cooperate in any investigation of Customer’s alleged illegal use of Tzulo’s facilities or other networks accessed through the Tzulo Network. If Customer fails to cooperate with any such investigation, Tzulo may suspend Customer’s Service. Additionally, Tzulo may modify or suspend Customer’s Service in the event of illegal use of the Tzulo Network or as necessary to comply with any law or regulation, including the Digital 
                Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, 17 U.S.C. 512, as reasonably determined by Tzulo. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>3.<strong> Other Networks.  </strong>Customer is responsible for paying any fees, obtaining any required approvals and complying with any laws or usage policies applicable to transmitting data beyond the Tzulo Network and/or through other public and private networks. Tzulo is not responsible or liable for performance or non-performance of such networks or their inter-connection points. </li><li>4.<strong> Bandwidth Billing. </strong> Tzulo’s customers are billed based on the 95th percentile adjustment of their bandwidth usage. The minimum monthly rate is dependent on the amount of space required to co-locate your servers and is available by the shelf, rack or cage.
                The purchase of space includes a minimum level of bandwidth usage, i.e. ¼ rack includes 256kbps of 95th percentile bandwidth. Any bandwidth used above that is billed on a per kbs rate. On average, this method of calculating bandwidth results in you paying for only 70% of your peak bandwidth usage. 95th percentile pricing is based on a plotted graph of 5 minute averages taken over a monthly period. The busiest 5% of the five minute samples (equivalent to the busiest 37 hours of usage every month) are discarded. The next highest sample is used to calculate the customer’s bandwidth charges. A detailed explanation of this 95th percentile billing can be described as follows.
                </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>4.1Traffic to and from a customer’s router is accumulated over a five minute period. The total amount of data transferred over this period is divided by 300 seconds to get a sample plot measured in bits per second, bps. </li><li>4.2The total of the input and output sample rates are used for this plotting point. </li><li>4.3Over a period of one month (i.e. 30 days) there are 8640 points plotted. The busiest 5% or 432 points are discarded, leaving you with 8208 points plotted. The largest of these points, measured in kbs, is used to calculate your bandwidth charge. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>4.4If your monthly billing program is based on 512kbs bandwidth and your busiest sample, after discarding the top 5% of the plotted points, is 540kbs, then you would be billed for an additional 28kbs for that month. Any month that has overages above the contractually committed transfer rate will be billed at 125% of the committed rate price. Here is a sample of what the graph will look. The top 5% of the highest points would be taken out and the next highest peak would determine the bandwidth used for billing purposes. The 95th percentile billed usually equates to about twice the average daily throughput, +/- 15%. Unless otherwise stated on the Service Order Form, bandwidth transfer over the committed amount will be billed at 25% over the committed rate. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>4.5<strong> Unmetered Bandwidth.  </strong> Unmetered Bandwidth maintains a no commit gurantee on ports speeds for services. Unmetered Bandwidth services allow customers to burst to the
full speed of the service port for short time periods, but not to have sustained usage that is greater then 95% metric of 30% of the port. ie a 100mb port cannot be utilized and sustained beyond 30megabits without upgrading
service to a dedicaed or Burst Bandwidth model. ie a 1gigabit port cannot be utilized beyond 30% or 300mbs of sustained usage (95th metric) without upgrading bandwidth options with tzulo. Tzulo has the right to cap, rate limit,
 or traffic shape your service to comply with our needs to maintain a fair and acceptable usage amongst other customers on this shared service. Unmetered Service is not gurantee of any port speeds or performance metrics. It is
the ability to burst without metering for compensation.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  TZULO reserves the right to make changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement upon thirty (30) days notice to the Customer, advising of the change and the effective date thereof, but with changes in service fees being effective only at the end of any period for which the Customer has prepaid. Utilization of the service by the Customer following the effective date of such change shall constitute acceptance by the Customer of such change(s). </p></p> <p><p>  The validity, interpretation, enforceability, and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois. </p></p> <p><p>  In the event it is necessary for TZULO to enforce its rights under this agreement, Customer agrees to pay all fees incurred by TZULO (including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees and collection agency fees) </p></p> <p><p>  Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not be amended except upon the written consent of Customer and an officer of TZULO. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, remedy, or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, or power provided herein or by law or in equity. The waiver by any party of the time for performance of any act or condition hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of the act or condition itself. </p></p> <p><p>  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Customer, TZULO and our respective successors, and assigns. Customer may not assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of NR SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

ACTIVATION OF SERVICE SHALL 
              INDICATE TZULO’S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. USE OF THE TZULO NETWORK CONSTITUTES 
              ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. CUSTOMER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT CUSTOMER HAS FULL AUTHORITY AND RIGHT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. CUSTOMER FURTHER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT CUSTOMER IS AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE. </p></p> <p><p>   *Note* Payments to tzulo are Non-Refundable.</p></p> <p><p>  As a provider of Internet access, web site hosting, and other Internet-related services, Tzulo offers its customers (also known as subscribers), and their customers and users, the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial, and non-commercial information. Tzulo respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information, however, when there are competing interests at issue, Tzulo reserves the right to take certain preventative or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, Tzulo has developed an Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP"), which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement and is intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations when utilizing Tzulo’s services. This AUP will be revised from time to time. A customer’s use of Tzulo’s services after changes to the AUP are posted on Tzulo’s web site, www.tzulo.com, will constitute the customer’s acceptance of any new or additional terms of the AUP that result from those changes. </p></p> <p><p>  One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet’s openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use the Internet, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others. When subscribers obtain information through the Internet, they must keep in mind that Tzulo cannot monitor, verify, warrant, or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information that subscribers may acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet is sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because Tzulo cannot monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, Tzulo cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers that results from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive, or illegal Internet communications. </p></p> <p><p>  When subscribers disseminate information through the Internet, they also must keep in mind that Tzulo does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may create. When users place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech. Also, because the information they create is carried over Tzulo’s network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers and non-subscribers of Tzulo, subscribers’ postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may harm Tzulo’s goodwill, business reputation, and operations. For these reasons, subscribers violate Tzulo’s policy and the service agreement when they, their customers, affiliates, or subsidiaries engage in the following prohibited activities: </p></p> <p><p>  Spamming—Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages over the Internet (known as "spamming"). It is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward Tzulo, but also because it can overload Tzulo’s network and disrupt service to Tzulo subscribers. Also, maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited. When a complaint is received, Tzulo has the discretion to determine from all of the evidence whether the email recipients were from an "opt-in" email list. Any Spam related abuse that results in listing on a Spam list such as Spamhaus, RBL, Barracuda, RATS, CYMRU, RSBL, SPAMCOP, etc. will result in immediate termination without refund, or data recovery.</p></p> <p><p>  Intellectual Property Violations—Engaging in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, software piracy, and patents held by individuals, corporations, or other entities. Also, engaging in activity that violates privacy, publicity, or other personal rights of others. Tzulo is required by law to remove or block access to customer content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement. It is also Tzulo’s policy to terminate the privileges of customers who commit repeat violations of copyright laws. </p></p> <p><p>  Obscene Speech or Materials—Using Tzulo’s network to advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material. Tzulo is required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through Tzulo’s network. </p></p> <p><p>  Defamatory or Abusive Language—Using Tzulo’s network as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language. </p></p> <p><p>  Forging of Headers—Forging or misrepresenting message headers, IP headers, whether in whole or in part, to mask the originator of the message or IP Packet will result in IMMEDIATE termination. NO refund will be issued. </p></p> <p><p>  Spoofing of Packets-Spoofing or forging of packet headers, MAC addresess spoofing, or any altercation of the normal TCP Stack of any kind is immediate grounds for termination. NO refunds will be issued.</p></p> <p><p>  Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks—Accessing illegally or without authorization computers, accounts, or networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security measures of another individual’s system (often known as "hacking"). Also, any activity that might be used as a precursor to an attempted system penetration (i.e. port scan, stealth scan, or other information gathering activity). </p></p> <p><p>  Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities—Distributing information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mail bombing, or denial of service attacks. Also, activities that disrupt the use of or interfere with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected network, system, service, or equipment. </p></p> <p><p>  Facilitating a Violation of this AUP—Advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available any software, program, product, or service that is designed to violate this AUP, which includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, flooding, mail bombing, denial of service attacks, and piracy of software. 
              Export Control Violations—Exporting encryption software over the Internet or otherwise, to points outside the United States. </p></p> <p><p>  Usenet Groups—Tzulo reserves the right not to accept postings from newsgroups where we have actual knowledge that the content of the newsgroup violates the AUP. </p></p> <p><p>  Other Illegal Activities—Engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards, and pirating software. </p></p> <p><p>  Other Activities—Engaging in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that Tzulo determines to be harmful to its subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill, or customer relations. </p></p> <p><p>  DDOS Mitigation / Server Hardening / etc - At no time should client engage in DDOS mitigation services that help to filter/scrub/block DDOS attacks as a service for clients. Doing so may result in termination without refund. </p></p> <p><p>  As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding the harmful activities just described rests primarily with the subscriber. Tzulo will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its subscribers to ensure that they comply with Tzulo policy or applicable law. When Tzulo becomes aware of harmful activities, however, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including but not limited to, removing information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or take any other action it deems appropriate. </p></p> <p><p>  Tzulo also is aware that many of its subscribers are, themselves, providers of Internet services, and that information reaching Tzulo’s facilities from those subscribers may have originated from a customer of the subscriber or from another third-party. Tzulo does not require its subscribers who offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or web sites created by customers of its subscribers. Tzulo has the right to directly take action against a customer of a subscriber. Also, Tzulo may take action against the Tzulo subscriber because of activities of a customer of the subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of the subscriber. Similarly, Tzulo anticipates that subscribers who offer Internet services will cooperate with Tzulo in any corrective or preventive action that Tzulo deems necessary. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures is a violation of Tzulo policy. </p></p> <p><p>  Tzulo also is concerned with the privacy of on-line communications and web sites. In general, the Internet is neither more nor less secure than other means of communication, including mail, facsimile, and voice telephone service, all of which can be intercepted and otherwise compromised. As a matter of prudence, however, Tzulo urges its subscribers to assume that all of their on-line communications are insecure. Tzulo cannot take any responsibility for the security of information transmitted over Tzulo’s facilities. </p></p> <p><p>  Tzulo will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail messages sent or received by its subscribers unless required to do so by law, governmental authority, or when public safety is at stake. Tzulo may, however, monitor its service electronically to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily. Also, Tzulo may disclose information, including but not limited to, information concerning a subscriber, a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation, or governmental request. Tzulo assumes no obligation to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been provided and in some cases may be prohibited by law from giving such notice. Finally, Tzulo may disclose subscriber information or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect Tzulo and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of the system. </p></p> <p><p>  Tzulo expects that its subscribers who provide Internet services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy of on-line communications. A subscriber’s failure to comply with those laws will violate Tzulo policy. Finally, Tzulo wishes to emphasize that in signing the service agreement, subscribers indemnify Tzulo for any violation of the service agreement, law, or Tzulo policy, which results in loss to Tzulo or the bringing of any claim against Tzulo by any third-party. This means that if Tzulo is sued because of a subscriber’s or customer of a subscriber’s activity, the subscriber will pay any damages awarded against Tzulo, plus costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. </p></p> <p><p>  We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet users, including Tzulo and its subscribers, as responsible members of the Internet. Any complaints about a subscriber’s violation of this AUP should be sent to <a href="mailto:abuse@tzulo.com" target="_blank"> abuse@tzulo.com </a>. Any client found violating our TOS/AUP will result in termination without refund.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Collection and use of Information </strong>

Customer is responsible for following and ensuring its agents and representatives follow these Data Center Rules and Regulations concerning use of and access to the Tzulo Data Center. Tzulo reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate service if Customer or Customer’s representative violates the Rules and Regulations set forth below. </p></p> <p><p>  The Tzulo Data Center has a restricted access policy.
