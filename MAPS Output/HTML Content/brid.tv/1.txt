Our customers are businesses that use the BridTV Technology to host, embed, stream, and deliver advertising to, digital video over the web (collectively, “<strong> BridTV Services </strong>”).</p><p>  BridTV has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe our practices regarding the information we collect from:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Visitors to our website located at <a href="https://www.brid.tv/" target="_blank"> www.brid.tv </a>(the “<strong> Corporate Website </strong>”), including all subdomains,</li><li>Users who watch our customers’ videos on websites, apps, mobile apps, and other software powered by BridTV Technology (each, a “<strong> Customer Property </strong>”) using a desktop or laptop PC, mobile phone, tablet, connected TV, set-top box, kiosk, virtual reality hardware, or other devices, and</li><li>Visitors to our other owned-and-operated websites (each, a “<strong> BridTV Website </strong>”), including <a href="https://adiq.brid.tv/" target="_blank"> adiq.brid.tv </a> and <a href="https://developer.brid.tv/" target="_blank"> developer.brid.tv, </a></li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Visitors to our white-labeled operated websites (each, a <strong> “BridTV White Label Website </strong>“), including cms.a-2.tv, player.a-2.tv, adhunters.tv and vidssp.com.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy does <em> not </em> describe the information collection practices of our customers that use BridTV Technology on their Customer Properties. We are a third-party service provider to our customers. We recommend that you refer to our customers’ privacy policies to learn about their information collection practices.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Changes to this Privacy Policy. </strong> BridTV will update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices. We will post all Privacy Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice. The Privacy Policy posted on this page will say when that version went into effect. If you visit the Corporate Website or view a video on a Customer Property after a change, then you will have accepted BridTV’s new Privacy Policy. You are advised to review our Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p></p> <div><h2>  A. Corporate Website at <a href="https://www.brid.tv/" target="_blank"> www.brid.tv </a></h2><ul>  <li><strong> INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE CORPORATE WEBSITE </strong></li></ul><p>  Our Corporate Website provides information about our company, business, and the services we provide. It is also the portal used by our customers to sign into the customer dashboard for BridTV Services.</p><p>  The Corporate Website collects Personal Data, Usage Data, and Tracking Data when you visit the site at <a href="https://www.brid.tv/" target="_blank"> www.brid.tv </a>. As used in our discussion about the Corporate Website in this Section A:</p></div> <p><p>  “<strong> Personal Data </strong>” is the information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual. If you access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we use a different definition of Personal Data to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p></p> <p><p>  “<strong> Tracking Data </strong>” is the information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixel tags, web beacons, or scripts) that we use to keep track of visitor activity on the Corporate Website. (Note that the Tracking Data collected by BridTV Technology is different, and is discussed in Section B.)</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cookies </strong> are small files that contain a small amount of data, typically including a unique identifier. They are generally placed on your browser by a website or other browser-based service. Our Corporate Website uses cookies.</li><li><strong> Other tracking technologies </strong>, in the context of the Corporate Website, include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used to track usage and performance. (See Section B below for the tracking technologies used by BridTV Technology.)</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  “<strong> Usage Data, </strong>” in the context of the Corporate Website, is the information that your browser sends to BridTV servers when you visit the Corporate Website.</p></p> <p><p>  As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time your browser or device interacts with the Corporate Website, and store that information in “log files.” The information stored in our web servers’ log files includes information that we call Personal Data, Usage Data and Tracking Data, and that we describe more fully in the following sections.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Note for visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK: </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Personal Data. </strong> In the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, Personal Data is defined differently than in the U.S., and means a variety of data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device (e.g., names, addresses, cookie identifiers, mobile device identifiers, precise location data and biometric data). For visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data – such as a visitor’s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) – are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Legal grounds for processing your Personal Data when accessing the Corporate Website. </strong> For visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section A.2. on one or more of the following legal grounds:</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  2. <strong> ABOUT PERSONAL DATA </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Personal Data Collected by the Corporate Website. Personal Data includes your name, email address, postal address, and telephone number.
