</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
				Data portability - where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal data is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.
			</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
				Right to restriction of processing - you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data (that is, allow only its storage) where:
				</li><li>
						you contest the accuracy of the personal data, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;
					</li><li>
						where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal data;
					</li><li>
						where we no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
					</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
						where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below), pending verification as to whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
