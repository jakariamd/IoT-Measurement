                                Whether at home or on public Wi-Fi, Avast SecureLine VPN encrypts your internet connection with the click of a button, securing your connection and preventing employers, advertisers, governments, and internet providers from seeing what you do online.

                                Avast Secure Browser includes several layers of privacy protection that mask your digital identity while you browse. This prevents websites from identifying you online and blocks third parties from tracking your data and activity. Secure Browser also gives you a faster browsing experience by automatically blocking ads to improve website load time.

                                Additionally, built-in security protects your data from hackers, prevents malicious downloads, and ensures websites encrypt your data. We’ll also alert you if your login credentials are ever compromised.

                                Your online habits can be tracked to create a digital ‘fingerprint’ made up of everything from your search history to the goods you’ve bought and the places you traveled. This highly sensitive information may be sold to third parties who can use it to target you with ads or even raise prices on products they know you will be interested in.

                                Avast AntiTrack gives you greater online privacy by disguising your digital fingerprint to keep your true identity private and  exposing and blocking attempts to track you.
