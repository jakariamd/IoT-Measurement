        affiliates and subsidiaries), how we collect that information, how that
        information may be stored and used, and with whom it may be shared. By
        accessing or using our website, http://www.tapresearch.com (the “Website”
        or “Platform”), participating in our surveys, or using other products or
        services we provide (collectively, “Services”), you accept and consent to
        the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.
      </p></div> <p><p>  
        If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, then you must not access or
        use the Services. Please note that our Services may be offered through or
        in connection with third-party mobile applications or third-party websites.
        This Privacy Policy governs your use of the Services and not your use of
        such third-party applications or websites.

        Definitions
      </h4><p>  
        “Personal Information” means information that identifies, relates to,
        describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be
        linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household;
        provided, however, that as applicable “Personal Information” shall have the
        definition given to “Personal Data” under the General Data Protection
        Regulation (“GDPR”).
      </p><p>  
        “Separate and Independent Controller” means each party is a distinct
        Controller with regard to Personal Information and determines its
        independent legal basis for the processing of Personal Information
        received.
      </p></div> <div><h4>  
        Information Collected and Method of Collection
      </h4><p>  
        Information (including Personal Information) collected is relevant for the
        purpose for which it is to be used and, to the extent necessary,
        TapResearch takes reasonable steps to ensure that data is reliable for
        intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
      </p></div> <div><h4>  
        Technical Data
      </h4><p>  
        When you use the Services, we automatically collect and store information
        about your computer or mobile device and your online activities (“Response
        Metadata”), which we transfer and store in accordance with the provisions
        contained in this Privacy Policy. Response Metadata may include:
      </p><ul>  <li>
            Device Information/Specifications: Technical information about your
            computer or device (e.g., type of device, web browser or operating
            system, IP address, etc.).
          
</li><li>
            Geographic Location: We use your IP address to derive your computer or
            device's approximate geographic location.
          
</li><li>
            Time, Length and Extent of Usage: When you use the Services, how long
            you use a Service for (e.g., how long it takes you to answer a survey
            question) and which Services feature(s) and/or function(s) you use.
          
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
            Cookies: We may use cookies to keep track of some types of information
            while you are using the Services. Cookies are very small files placed
            on your computer, which allow us to perform analytics, such as counting
            the number of users of the Services and distinguishing repeat users
            from new or unique users. Cookies help provide additional functionality
            to the Services and help us analyze usage of the Services more
            accurately, such as user preferences or trends (e.g., the Services may
            set a cookie on your browser allowing you to bypass engagement with a
            survey due to your previous completion of a survey). We rely on cookies
            for the proper operation of the Services; therefore, if your browser is
            set to reject cookies, the Services may not function properly. If you
            refuse cookies from the Services, you assume all responsibility for any
            resulting loss of functionality or benefits with respect to the
            Services. Our Cookie Policy can be found here:
            <a href="/legal/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.
          
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
            Mobile Device ID: We collect mobile device identifiers, such as Apple’s
            Identifier for Advertising ID (IDFA) or Google’s Android Advertising ID
            (AAID), to help us identify you within a mobile application and match
            you with appropriate survey opportunities.
          
</li><li>
            Web Beacons: We may use web beacons in email communications in order to
            understand the behavior of our users. “Web beacons” (also known as
            “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small transparent graphic images
            that are often used in conjunction with cookies in order to further
            personalize the Services for our users and to collect a limited set of
            information about our users.
          
</li></ul></ul> <div><h4>  
        Personal Information You Provide to Us
      </h4><p>  
        We collect information that you submit to us voluntarily through the
        Services. In these instances, you know what information we collect because
        you provide it directly to us.
      </p></div> <div><h4>  
        Profile and Respondent Screening Data
      </h4><p>  
        If you choose to register for an account, we collect the following
        information from you:
      </p><ul>  <li>
            Name
          
</li><li>
            Email address
          
</li><li>
            Username and password
          
</li><li>
            Other demographic data
          
</li></ul><p>  
        Before you fill out a survey, we ask that you also create a user profile to
        help us match you with a survey. When you fill out a user profile, we
        collect additional information from you, including demographic information
        such as postal code, gender, marital status, education, ethnicity/race
        (where permitted by applicable law), employment related information, and
        non-personally identifiable information on household members, household
        income, age, etc.
      </p></div> <p><p>  
        When you consent to our collection of your Personal Information, we act as
        a Controller of that data whether collected on our Websites and Platform,
        through our other Services, or received from our customers. Customers may
        receive Personal Information collected pursuant to your participation in
        surveys either independent of our Websites or Platform, and in such cases
        our customer is a Separate and Independent Controller of that data.
      </p></p> <p><p>  
        We contractually limit the usage and sale of Profile and Technical Data by
        our third-party partners or customers involved in the survey experience.
        You would need to directly consent for any further resale by those
        third-parties.
      </p></p> <div><h4>  
        Survey Data
      </h4><p>  
        Occasionally, we host surveys for our survey partners and collect the
        information submitted through these surveys. We do not own this information
        and any information you choose to provide is used in accordance with the
        survey partner’s privacy practices and direction to us. In this scenario,
        TapResearch acts a Processor. Please note that in such cases you will be
        presented with terms and conditions of the survey partner before
        proceeding, and your participation in that survey is governed separately by
        those terms and conditions.
      </p></div> <div><h4>  
        User Feedback
      </h4><p>  
        If you provide us with comments, suggestions, recommendations or other
        feedback pertaining to our Services (collectively “Feedback”), you
        understand that we may (although we have no obligation to do so) retain,
        disclose, use, or otherwise commercially exploit that Feedback in
        connection with any or all of our Services without any compensation or
        consideration to you.
      </p></div> <div><h4>  
        Developer Information
      </h4><p>  
        We may collect certain information from our developer partners at the time
        of registration and in connection with your use of the Services, including
        your name, email address, company name, app title(s), as well as financial
        information such as Tax ID, VAT or sales tax registration number or any
        other relevant tax number and payment information (e.g., bank account and
        routing number for ACH purposes).
      </p></div> <div><h4>  
        How We Use Your Information
      </h4><p>  
        Pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we may use the information we
        collect from you for the following purposes:

        We may ask you to provide additional information, such as your name, email
        address, or other basic Personal Information about you that we already have
        on file, in order to verify who is making the request. Please note that any
        requested disclosures will only apply to the 12-month period preceding the
        request, and you are entitled to request disclosure regarding your Personal
        Information twice in any 12-month period.

        Your Right to Opt out of the “Sale” of Your Information
      </h4><p>  
        We will never disclose Personal Information such as your name or address to
        third parties in exchange for monetary consideration without your consent.
      </p><p>  
        However, under CCPA’s broad definition, “Personal Information” may also
        include, in addition to names, addresses, and the like) unique identifiers,
        IP addresses, biometric information, internet or other network, geolocation
        data, audio/visual data, and even inferences which may be drawn from any of
        the above.
      </p></div> <p><p>  
        CCPA also defines the term “sell” broadly. Its meaning includes “renting,
        releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, [and]
        transferring…for monetary or other valuable consideration.”
      </p></p> <p><p>  
        Under these broad definitions, certain information we provide to our
        clients as part of survey results may arguably be deemed a “sale” of
        “Personal Information” under CCPA. You have the right to opt out of this
        “sale.” For more information on how to opt out, please click here:
