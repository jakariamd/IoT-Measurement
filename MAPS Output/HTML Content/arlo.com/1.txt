privacy personally.</h1></div> <div><h3>  Our commitment.</h3><p>  At Arlo, we’re as passionate about privacy as we are about safeguarding your home and family. We support industry standards for data protection designed to keep your personal information private and in your control. After all, we’re here to bring you peace of mind and you shouldn’t have to give up your privacy to feel secure.</p></div> <div><h2>  Trust.</h2></div> <div><h4>  We believe your personal data belongs to you.</h4></div> <div><h4>  We don't monetize your
personal data.</h4><p>  Our business is delivering Arlo services and Arlo functionality, and any related services or functionality that you choose. Arlo was founded as a security company first and foremost. Our products were designed to help protect your home and provide peace of mind by letting you keep an eye on your home, your business, and your loved ones, not by utilizing your personal information as a commodity to make money.</p></div> <div><h4>  Your personal information
should be yours.</h4><p>  Our products and services are designed to protect your privacy and give you control over your information. As part of delivering our products and services, we must at times disclose certain information to partners as described in our <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank"> privacy policy </a>. We won’t share your videos or account information with law enforcement, unless there’s a legally enforceable search warrant or court order, and we never share your videos for private litigation matters without your consent.</p></div> <div><h2>  Control.</h2></div> <div><h4>  Your data is for your eyes only.</h4></div> <div><h4>  We provide enhanced control of your data.</h4><p>  With Arlo’s Privacy Center, you can adjust your settings at any time to easily manage devices with access to your account, modify smart home apps linked to your account, erase cloud content and reset your Arlo devices. When you choose to store your videos in the Arlo cloud, they are stored for the duration of your chosen Arlo plan. After that, your videos are automatically deleted and unrecoverable. Manually deleting videos using your Arlo Secure App or web browser will also delete your videos from the Arlo cloud.</p></div> <div><h4>  We support transparency.</h4><p>  We want people to have a clear understanding of our privacy practices. Our privacy policy outlines how we collect and use personal information as well as how we comply with applicable privacy legislation. We want product users to feel empowered to make decisions about their data and who has access to it.

We also inform you when you change certain information in your account settings. Beyond that, we monitor our cloud systems and utilize multiple data protection technologies and methodologies to actively look for security threats.</p></div> <div><h4>  We made security part of
our culture.</h4><p>  We implemented strict company-wide information security policies and procedures intended to protect your privacy and enhance the secure use of our products by you.
