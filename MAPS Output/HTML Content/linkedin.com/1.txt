                Notice for California Consumers
              </p><p>  Last revised December 12, 2022</p><p>  This notice describes the rights of Californians under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (together, “CCPA”). The CCPA requires businesses like us to provide certain information to California consumers. We fully describe our practices to all our members and visitors in our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a>, but use this separate notice to ensure that we meet the CCPA’s requirements. This notice contains the following four parts:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>You Can Opt Out of Our Sharing Your Personal Information. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information.</li><li>Your CCPA Rights</li><li>The CCPA Categories of Personal Information We Collect and the Sources</li><li>The CCPA Categories of Personal Information We Disclose for a “Business Purpose”</li><li>1. You Can Opt Out of Our Sharing Your Personal Information. We Do Not Sell Your Personal Information.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> If you are a LinkedIn member, </em> <em> click here to opt out of sharing </em><em> . Guests can opt out by visiting </em> <em> guest controls </em> In addition to these controls, in the U.S. we will automatically opt you out of sharing if we receive a Global Privacy Control signal from you that reflects your choice to opt-out of sharing.</p></p> <p><p>  The CCPA requires us to disclose if we share your personal information. We may share your personal information, including information about your visits to LinkedIn, with our partners in order to market LinkedIn’s services to you on other platforms. If you are a member, we may also share your personal information with Microsoft to personalize the ads you see when you use Microsoft services.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not sell your personal information.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>2. Your Rights Under the CCPA</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  The CCPA provides Californians with the following rights:</p></div> <div><h3>  2.1 Requests for Information</h3><p>  Like all of our members, you (or your authorized agent) can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50191" target="_blank"> request a copy of your personal information </a>. Under the CCPA, you can also request that we disclose how we have collected, used, and disclosed your personal information over the past 12 months, including the categories of personal information we collected and our purposes for doing so; the categories of sources for that information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared it or disclosed it for a business purpose and our purposes for doing so. Companies that sell personal information (we do not) must make additional disclosures.</p></div> <p><p>  If you are not a LinkedIn member, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DCR" target="_blank"> you can submit your request </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/TS-DCR" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  2.2 Your Right to Opt Out of Sales</h3><p>  We do not sell personal information, so we don’t have an opt out.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.3 Your Right to Opt Out of Sharing</h3><p>  Under the CCPA, you can opt out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. You can direct us not to share your personal information as described in Section 1.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.4 Your Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information</h3><p>  Under the CCPA, you can limit a business’s use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information to certain purposes specified by law (e.g., providing you with services you request or preventing fraud, or for other purposes that don’t involve deriving your attributes). We only use sensitive personal information for such permitted purposes, so we don’t have an opt-out.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.5 Your Right to Notification</h3><p>  Under the CCPA, a business like LinkedIn cannot collect new categories of personal information or use them for materially different purposes without first notifying you.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.6 Nondiscrimination for Exercising Your CCPA Rights</h3><p>  The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or quality of services, or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services as a result of exercising your rights.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.7 Your Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information</h3><p>  Like all of our members, you can edit much of your personal information through your LinkedIn account (such as your profile information). You can also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/93560" target="_blank"> request that we correct inaccurate personal information </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.8 Your Right to Delete Personal Information</h3><p>  Like all of our members, you can request that we delete your personal information <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63" target="_blank"> by closing your LinkedIn account </a> or by requesting that we <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/93500" target="_blank"> delete specific information </a> about you. We honor such requests unless an exception applies, such as when the information is necessary to complete the transaction or contract for which it was collected or when information is being used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, comply with laws, identify and repair bugs, or ensure another consumer’s ability to exercise their free speech rights or other rights provided by law.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.9 LinkedIn Annual CCPA Metrics</h3><p>  Please visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/california-privacy-disclosure-annual-metrics" target="_blank"> LinkedIn's CCPA Annual Metrics page </a> to view metrics required by CCPA regulations for the past calendar year.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.10 Statement Regarding Selling or Sharing the Personal Information of Consumers Under Age 16</h3><p>  CCPA regulations require us to state whether we have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. As stated in our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank"> user agreement </a>, LinkedIn services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly provide services to anyone under the age of 16 nor do we have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.
