currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA requires us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser), and we are not technically able to perform such process unless the requestor visits our web form  (where we also collect additional information about the requestor’s TV viewing and household as part of our verification process for such requests).  Therefore, if you submit such a request via either the telephone number listed above or the email address listed above, it will require more time and at least one more step than if you were to submit your request via web form. We will respond to both telephone and email requests by sending you a link to the web form. The web form will prompt you to confirm your request and submit the additional information described above. </p></p> <p><p>  Please note that the process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA also requires a service provider to recognize or place its cookie ID on your browser when you visit our web form; such service provider may use the information it collects during performance of this service (which collected information consists only of Identifiers (cookie IDs)) only on our behalf in connection with this process.  We use the information that we collect to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA (which information includes Identifiers (such as email addresses and cookie IDs) and Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as TV viewing information)) only in connection with such purposes and for security and/or fraud-prevention purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that, if you are opted out of targeted advertising on the web browser you are using when you visit our web form, or if your browser is configured to block cookies, we may not be able to verify or process your “Right to Know” request or your “Right to Delete” request, since we may have no reasonable method of connecting your request with the Licensed Data we have collected about you. </p></p> <p><p>  If you are a California consumer, you have the right, at any time, to direct us not to sell your personal information; you may exercise such “Right to Opt Out” under CCPA by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link below, which takes you to the web form listed above, or via any of the other methods described above:</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION </strong></p><p>  The process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA requires us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser), and we are not technically able to perform such process unless the requestor visits our web form. Therefore, if you submit such a request via either the telephone number or the email address listed above, it will require more time and at least one more step than if you were to submit your request via the web form. We will respond to both telephone and email requests by sending you a link to the web form. The web form will prompt you to confirm your request. Please note that the process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA also entails a service provider recognizing or placing its cookie ID on your browser when you visit our web form; such service provider may use the information it so collects (which consists only of Identifiers (cookie IDs)) only on our behalf in connection with our CCPA request processes.  We use the information we collect to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA (which information includes Identifiers (such as email addresses and cookie IDs)) only in connection with such purpose.</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that, if you are opted out of targeted advertising on the web browser you are using when you visit our web form, or if your browser is configured to block cookies, we may not be able to process your “Right to Opt Out” request, since we may have no reasonable method of connecting your request to opt-out under CCPA with your Licensed Data. However, as (i) Licensed Data originates from TV viewing information and (ii) we receive Licensed Data from data licensors (who may be considered “data brokers” under California law) that have contractually agreed to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, we believe that you should also be able to exercise CCPA rights, including the right to opt out under CCPA (i.e., to elect “Do Not Sell”), with respect to your personal information through your smart TV(s), MVPD device(s), and/or OTT box/device(s).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Authorized Agents </strong>If you are a California consumer, you may use an “authorized agent” (as defined by CCPA) to submit a “Request to Know”, a “Request to Delete”, and/or a “Request to Opt-Out” under CCPA on your behalf.  Your authorized agent will need to provide us with a copy of a written permission that is signed by you and indicates that you have provided such authorization.  Also, as both (i) the process we currently use to verify and process “Requests to Know” and “Requests to Delete” under CCPA and (ii) the process we currently use to process “Requests to Opt-Out” under CCPA require (a) us to recognize the requestor’s VideoAmp cookie ID (and if one cannot be found, to place a VideoAmp cookie ID onto the requestor’s browser) and (b) the requestor to visit our web form, your authorized agent will also need to use your device in connection with any such CCPA request.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Recordkeeping Information </strong>VideoAmp will maintain records of consumer requests made pursuant to CCPA and how we responded to those requests in accordance with CCPA.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> CCPA Metrics for Calendar Year 2022 </strong></p><p>  Pursuant to § 999.317(g)(1) of the CCPA Regulations the following metrics have been compiled:</p><p>  <strong> Requests to Know: </strong></p><td>  Received</td><td>  Complied</td><td>  Denied</td><td>  Average Response Time</td><td>  6.6</td><p>  <strong> Requests to Delete: </strong></p><td>  Received</td><td>  Complied</td><td>  Denied</td><td>  Average Response Time</td><td>  11</td><td>  11</td><td>  8.6</td><p>  <strong> Requests to opt-out: </strong></p></div> <div><td>  Received</td><td>  Complied</td><td>  Denied</td><td>  Average Response Time</td><p>  If you are a California consumer and have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies or If you are a California consumer and have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies or practices, please email us at <a href="mailto:CCPAPrivacy@VideoAmp.com" target="_blank"> CCPAPrivacy@VideoAmp.com </a>.</p><p>  Last Modified: July 18, 2023</p></div> <div><h2>  Explore our culture</h2></div> <div><h3>  People</h3></div> <div><h3>  Technology</h3></div> <div><h3>  Health & Wellness</h3><p>  Stay in The Know</p><ul>  <li>Email address</li><li>Name</li></ul><p>  © VideoAmp, Inc.
