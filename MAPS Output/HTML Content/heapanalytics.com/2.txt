This means that we determine and are responsible for how your personal information is used. Heap’s Data Protection Office (“</p></div> <div><span>  <strong> DPO </strong></span><span>  ”) may be contacted at </span><span>  dpo@heap.io</span><p>  <strong> Personal Data </strong></p><span>  : When we use the term “personal data” in this section, we mean information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</span><p>  <strong> 1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU WHEN YOU USE THE HEAP EUROPEAN SERVICES, AND HOW WE USE IT </strong></p><p>  We collect the categories of personal data that you voluntarily submit directly to us when you use the European Services, as set forth in our Privacy Policy under the section entitled </p></div> <div><span>  <strong> Information We Collect and Our Use </strong></span><span>  . The table at </span><span>  <strong> Annex 1 </strong></span><span>   sets out in detail the categories of personal data we collect about you and how we use that information when you use the European Services, as well as the legal basis which we rely on to process the personal information and recipients of that personal information.</span><p>  <strong> 2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AUTOMATICALLY </strong></p><p>  We also automatically collect personal information indirectly about how you access and use the European Services, and information about the device you use to access the European Services. For example, we may collect: (a) information about the features you use and the pages you view on the European Services; (b) information about your device (such as your IP address, device identifier, device type, model and manufacturer); and (c) information about your usage patterns (such as how often you use the Heap European Services and your language settings). We use this information to provide you the features and functionality of the European Services, to monitor and improve the European Services and to develop new services.</p></div> <div><p>  The table at </p><span>  <strong> Annex 2 </strong></span><span>   sets out further information about the categories of personal information we collect about you automatically and how we use that information. The table also lists the legal basis which we rely on to process the personal information and recipients of that personal information.</span><p>  We may link or combine the personal information we collect about you and the information we collect automatically.</p><p>  We may anonymise and aggregate any of the personal information we collect (so that it does not directly identify you). We may use anonymised information for purposes that include testing our IT systems, research, data analysis, improving the Heap European Services. We may also share such anonymised and aggregated information with others.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> 3. HOW LONG WILL WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We will usually store the personal information we collect about you for no longer than necessary for the purposes set out in Annex 1 and Annex 2, in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.</p></p> <div><p>  The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:</p><ul>  <li>(a) Legitimate Interests. Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time based on the particular interest, taking into account the fundamental interests and the rights and freedoms of data subjects.</li><li>(b) Consent. Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain the information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfill the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>(c) Contract. Where we are processing personal information based on contract, we generally will retain the information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from the contractual relationship.</li><li>(d) Legal Obligation. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain the information for the period of time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>(e) Legal Claim. We may need to apply a “legal hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim.  In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In all cases, in addition to the purposes and legal bases, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, as well as the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4. RECIPIENTS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></p></p> <p><p>  In addition to the recipients listed in Annexes 1 and 2, we may also share your personal information with the following (as required in accordance with the uses set out in Annexes 1 and 2):</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>(a) </li></ul><span>  <strong> Service providers and advisors </strong></span><span>  : we may share your personal information with third party vendors and other service providers that perform services for us or on our behalf, which may include providing professional services, such as legal and accounting services, mailing, email or chat services, fraud prevention, web hosting, or providing analytic services.</span><ul>  <li>(b) </li></ul><span>  <strong> Affiliates </strong></span><span>  .
