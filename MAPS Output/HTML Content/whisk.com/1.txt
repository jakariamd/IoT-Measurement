If you have a Whisk account, we may verify your identity by requiring you to sign in to your account. If you do not have a Whisk account, or an email address or phone number on file with us, or if the information you provide does not match what is in our records, then we may not be able to process your request, as there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA. Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file, and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we may not be able to process your request at this time.  If you are an authorized agent or parent/guardian making a request on behalf of a consumer or your child, we may require and request additional information to verify that you are authorized to make that request.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Additional Information </strong>: To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. We reserve the right to deny your request if we cannot verify your identity or an exemption applies.  In addition, depending on the nature of your request and the risk of fraud, we may not be able to fulfill it.  Where we deny your request in whole or in part, we will inform you of the denial, provide an explanation of our actions, and the reason(s) for the denial.  In the event your request is incomplete or deficient, we will endeavor to inform you how it may be corrected.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Do Not Track </strong>: California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Do Not Track (“DNT”) features that allow you to tell a website not to track you.  Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p></p> <p><p>
