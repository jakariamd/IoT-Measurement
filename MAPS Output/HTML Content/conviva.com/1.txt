These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p></p> <p><p>  We use cookies, for example, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference) and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Site may be limited. We and our third party service providers  may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Site. Our Site currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals and operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  Please read more about how we use cookies and what information is collected using cookies in our cookie policy found at <a href="https://www.conviva.com/legal/" target="_blank"> www.conviva.com/legal </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Personalized Advertising </em>:  We may allow third parties, such as ad exchanges, web analytics vendors and data analytics vendors to integrate with the Site to help target or retarget ads to you (for instance, if you have shown interest in working with us), to measure the effectiveness of those ads, or simply to better understand how you interact with our Site or our advertising (including our emails).  When ads are based on your activities across various websites or apps, over time, or tied to other information about you, this is sometimes known as “personalized” or “interest-based” advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also engage in “cross-device” advertising or CRM “onboarding” in order to market our own services to you.  Cross-device advertising is when third party vendors (or we) tie an identifier (such as a cookie ID or IP address) to information related to other devices that you may use (e.g., your computer, tablet or device) in order to measure and target advertisements tailored to your interest across devices, and to try to identify you across multiple browsers or devices. CRM “onboarding” is when third party vendors serve you ads by associating deidentified and “hashed” codes derived from your email address to cookies when you browse the web or log into other devices or websites.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Opting Out of Personalized Advertising. </em><strong>    </strong>If you are interested in more information about personalized or “interest-based” advertising and how you can generally control cookies and other tracking devices from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link </a> or the <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN#!%2F" target="_blank"> Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link </a> to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank"> Google Ad Settings page </a>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that even if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you may continue to receive advertisements — for example, ads based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browser (like some Safari browsers) is configured to reject “opt out” cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt-out may not be effective in all cases.</p></p> <p><p>  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and you use the Site and Services at your own risk.</p></p> <p><p>  Conviva limits the access to your Personal Information about you to Conviva employees who are required to handle that information to provide services to you or in order to perform their jobs.</p></p> <p><p>  Conviva does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 16. If you become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information without the consent of their parent or guardian, you should contact us. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files or take other appropriate action.</p></p> <p><p>  Your Personal Information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other government jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to provide your Personal Information to Conviva, please be advised that we transfer all information including Personal Information to the United States and process it in the United States. If you are using the Services in the European Economic Area (the <strong> “EEA” </strong>), or in the United Kingdom (<b> UK </b>), then we will transfer your Personal Information outside of the EEA or UK, respectively, in accordance with applicable law, through the use of data transfer agreements authorized by the European Commission or other applicable supervisory authority.</p></p> <p><p>  You have certain rights under laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to the extent you act as the “business” (as opposed to a service provider) or the “controller” (as opposed to a processor), under those respective laws.  To the extent provided for by such laws and subject to applicable exceptions, this includes rights in relation to the Identification Information, Internet Activity Information, and Administrative and Contact Information we collect:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>the right to reasonable access to find out what Personal Information (if any) we process about you and how we are processing such Personal Information.

You may designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above. We may take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise the rights listed above and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf. This includes (depending on the request) providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney, and where appropriate requiring the person holding such rights to verify their own identity.</span></span> <p><p>  Please note that we may require you to verify your login credentials before you can submit a request in order to protect your Personal Information. If you do not have an account with us, or if we suspect fraudulent or malicious activity, we may ask you to provide additional Personal Information for verification.

The Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America.</p></p> <p><p>  Subject to the Arbitration Agreement below, for all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California. Use of the Website Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Use, including without limitation, this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> a. Agreement to Arbitrate </strong></p></p> <p><p>  This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Use as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Company, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Website Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> c. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Company is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at support@conviva.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Company should be sent to 989 East Hillsdale Boulevard, Suite 400, Foster City, CA 94404, Attn: Legal Department (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Company and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Company is entitled.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> d. Arbitration Procedures </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p></p> <p><p>  Unless Company and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Company agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> e. Costs of Arbitration </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Company will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Company will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. The prevailing party in the arbitration will be entitled to recover the Arbitration Fees it has paid or owes and its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> f. Confidentiality </strong></p></p> <p><p>  All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> g. Severability </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> h. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, Company agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Website Services, you may reject any such change by sending Company written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Integration and Severability. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Unless otherwise stated on the Site, the Terms of Use are the entire agreement between you and Company with respect to the Website Service and use of the Sites, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Company with respect to the Sites. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Miscellaneous. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). The Terms of Use are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Company’s prior written consent. Company may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All notices under the Terms of Use will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Copyright and Trademark Notices. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Unless otherwise indicated, the Terms of Use and all Content provided by Company are copyright © 2008-2023 Conviva Inc.
