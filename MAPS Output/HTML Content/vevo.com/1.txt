</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Other Third Parties.  We may share personal information with a third party if you specifically authorize it, or it is required to complete a transaction, service or activity that you initiated or requested.  In such case, the collection and processing of your personal information may be subject to the privacy policy of such third party.  Please note that we are not responsible for the actions of third party distributors or platform or service operators (including those on which the Vevo Service is made available) or others.  The third party distributors of the Vevo Service and the third-party platform or service operators on which the Vevo Service is made available may independently process your information.

 </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Access or modify your personal information;
 
</li><li>Object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal information if the legal ground we are relying on is our legitimate interest or in the public interest;

</li><li>Under certain circumstances, have your personal information transferred to another company; or
 
</li><li>Withdraw any consents that you have previously provided to allow us to process your personal information.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vevo.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vevo.com </a>.  Please note that some requests may require you to verify your identity.</p></p> <p><p>  C. Notice to Consumers in the United States. If you are a resident of California or jurisdictions with similar laws (e.g., Colorado, Virginia Connecticut, Utah), you may have certain additional privacy rights under the applicable privacy laws in your state (“State Privacy Laws”).  This section generally describes those rights and how you can exercise them.</p></p> <p><p>  These rights are not absolute. In some situations we may not be able to process your request. This may include if a legal exception applies. We’ll let you know when or if a right doesn’t apply to you. You will not be discriminated against for exercising a privacy right. If you disagree with our decision you can contact us as described at the end of this policy. Those rights are:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Access:  to learn the categories of information we collect and use, and for those in California, the categories of sources of collection and disclosure and the business purpose for collection;
 
</li><li>Portability: a copy of the  specific pieces of Personal Information collected;
 
</li><li>Deletion: to have us delete information we collected from you; and
 
</li><li>Correction: asking us to fix your information..
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Please note that if we delete your personal information, some of our services will not work the same. For example, your previous opt out requests will not be saved and saved preferences and information will no longer be available.</p></p> <div><p>  Exercising your Rights:</p><p>  To exercise your rights, submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p><ul>  <li>Clicking HERE; or
</li><li>Emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vevo.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vevo.com </a>.
</li></ul><p>  Your verifiable consumer request must:</p><ul>  <li>Provide sufficient identifying information (including full name and email address) to allow us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected and retained Personal Information, and/or your authority to make such request on behalf of the data subject, and
</li><li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
 
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Note that we will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request or to review and comply with the request.</p></p> <p><p>  You may authorize someone to act as your agent and submit a request on your behalf. Due to the sensitivity of such requests, you must verify the agent’s authorization before we will act.  Accordingly:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>You or your agent must supply proof that the agent is registered with the Secretary of State to act on your behalf; or
</li><li>You or your agent must supply other written permission for a specific agent to act on your behalf, and will use your email address to connect directly with you to verify agent identity and authority.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm with a level of confidence appropriate to the sensitivity of the information that the personal information we have collected and retained in our systems and databases relates to you.</p></p> <p><p>  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us, but if you have an account with us, we may require you to log-in to such account in order to verify your identity or authority or to provide or delete your information.</p></p> <div><p>  Right to Opt out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information</p><p>  Residents of certain jurisdictions have the right to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of their personal data, as such terms are defined under State Privacy Laws.</p><p>  Under California law, “share” means disclosing your personal information by us to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, in exchange for money or anything else of value. Thus, when we use the term “share” under this section, we are using it in the narrow meaning of how it is defined under California law. Other State Privacy Laws do not use the term “share,” but describe the concept as using personal information for targeted advertising.</p></div> <p><p>  The term “sell” has a different meaning under certain State Privacy Laws.  For example, under the laws of California and Colorado, “sell” means exchanging your personal information by us with a third party for money or anything else of value. Under Virginia law, “sell” is the exchange of personal information for money only.</p></p> <p><p>  Currently, we participate in digital advertising networks to deliver advertising that is tailored to your interests. The participation in certain ad networks can constitute a “sale” or “sharing” of personal data under State Privacy Laws. Vevo also participates in certain data co-ops where we disclose your information to our marketing partners.  Although we never received monetary compensation for your data, this activity may constitute a “sale” under State Privacy Laws.  The categories of third parties to whom information may be disclosed in these contexts is our third party partners (e.g., advertisers and marketing partners and data analytics providers).</p></p> <div><p>  We may “sell” the following categories of Personal Information:</p><ul>  <li>Online identifiers;
</li><li>Demographic information;
</li><li>Geolocation information;
</li><li>Internet/electronic activity; 
</li><li>Commercial information; and
</li><li>Inferences drawn from the categories described above in order to create a profile about you to reflect your preferences, characteristics, preferences, behavior and attitudes.
</li></ul><p>  You can opt-out of being tracked by these third parties by clicking the “DO NOT SELL OR SHARE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION” link at the bottom of our Website.</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that your opt-out preferences are website/device specific.</p></p> <p><p>  You can also opt-out  by broadcasting an Opt-Out Preference Signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC) (on the browsers and/or browser extensions that support such a signal).  Note that we will only apply the request to that specific device or browser and only for cookie or pixel based selling and sharing.  Thus, you will need opt out on each browser and device where you use our services. If you clear your cookie history on a particular browser or device, your opt out request will no longer be saved.</p></p> <p><p>  To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising of your personal data, please visit </p></p> <span><span>  <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"> https://www.networkadvertising.org/ </a> to optout. You can also opt out of the re-sale of your personal information by other participants in these digital advertising networks by visiting this site and opting out of each participant’s digital property.</span></span> <div><p>  Right to Opt out of Profiling</p><p>  Residents of some jurisdictions—subject to certain exceptions—may have a right to opt out of forms of automated processing performed on Personal Information to evaluate, analyze or predict personal aspects related to your economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements (“Profiling”). </p><p>  We engage in cookie-based or digital advertising-based Profiling.  To opt out of this practice, please follow the instructions detailed above regarding opting out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information.</p></div> <div><p>  Right to Limit Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</p><p>  Residents of some jurisdictions may have a right to limit the processing of your Sensitive Personal Information (as defined by California law).  We do not collect or process Sensitive Personal Information for inferring characteristics or use or disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those permitted by law.</p><p>  Right to Appeal</p><p>  Residents of some jurisdictions (e.g., Virginia or Colorado) have a right to appeal our decision on a privacy rights request.   If  we were unable to fulfill your request, you may appeal our request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vevo.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vevo.com </a> within fourteen days of our decision, and provide a detailed reason for your appeal, as well as your state of residence.</p></div> <div><p>  Notice to Nevada Residents/Your Nevada Privacy Rights</p><p>  If you are a Nevada resident, please note that Vevo does not sell for monetary consideration the Personal Information of Nevada consumers for the purpose of resale to other entities.</p><p>  7.</p><p>  Data Collection From Children</p><p>  Vevo recognizes the need to adequately protect the privacy of all of its users, especially children.  The Vevo Service is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 16.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 16, we will promptly delete it, unless we are legally obligated to retain such information.  If you believe that we have mistakenly or unintentionally collected information from someone under the age of 16, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vevo.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vevo.com </a>.  For users in the United States, please also visit <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/" target="_blank"> https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/ </a> for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children's privacy online.</p></div> <p><p>  8.</p></p> <div><p>  Security</p><p>  While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information that we collect, use and/or store, which are consistent with applicable privacy and security laws.  These policies and measures are designed to prevent against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, modification and disclosure and unlawful destruction of your personal information.</p><p>  We also limit access to the Vevo Service to our own employees, contractors, operators, service providers and those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of and have a business need to access such information. We request that our third party contractors and service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality as those followed by Vevo. However, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications despite our efforts to prevent same and we therefore make no guarantees regarding the security of user information. While we are dedicated to securing your personal information and our systems and the Vevo Service, you are responsible for securing and maintaining the privacy of your credentials (e.g., user name and password) and verifying that personal information we maintain about you is accurate and current.</p></div> <p><p>  9.</p></p> <div><p>  Integration of Third Party Platforms and Services</p><p>  The Vevo Service may be linked to, rely on and/or be integrated with Third Party Platforms and other websites, applications, interfaces, services and/or platforms operated by other companies. The Vevo Service will also feature advertisements from third parties. Vevo is not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites, applications, interfaces, services and platforms operated by third parties that are linked to, rely on and/or integrated with the Vevo Service or for the privacy practices of third party advertising companies. Additionally, we are not responsible for protecting any personal information shared with a third party (e.g. OTT software platforms) through your use of the Vevo Service.</p></div> <p><p>  10.</p></p> <div><p>  Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</p><p>  This section provides you with information about how Vevo uses cookies or similar technologies on the Vevo Services, and information about how third parties may use such technologies in connection with the operation of the Vevo Services. We may use cookies and similar technologies to enable us to understand how you interact with our products, to improve your experience, and to allow you to use certain features. Cookies are small text files that are placed in your browser or on your device. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your device until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser or application). The Vevo Service may also use web beacons, pixels and other “tracking technologies”, which are small strings of code placed on a web page or in an email or advertisement.  These technologies allow your browser or device to recognize and store certain types of information (such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page with the beacon and a description of that page).</p></div> <p><p>  We share the Device information we collect with third party service providers. We cannot reasonably identify you based on this Device information; however, these third party service providers may combine the information with their own data to make inferences about what ads may be relevant to you. For example, we share your IP address so that advertisers can determine which region you live in and provide you ads in the language of that region. We receive revenue for ads served on the Vevo Service. Sometimes we get paid only for the placement of those ads and sometimes we get paid based on how they perform, for example, how many times an advertisement was viewed. We generally use aggregate, statistical data to find out more about how well ad campaigns have performed, and we may provide the results of these studies with third party service providers. To find out more information about ads and your information contact us at </p></p> <p><p>  Some web browsers have a setting that requests that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user (also known as a “Do Not Track” request).  Unfortunately, due to technological limitations, our Vevo Service does not recognize such “Do Not Track” requests.</p></p> <div><p>  The categories of cookies that may be used on the Vevo Services are as follows:
 </p><ul>  <li>Functionality cookies: These cookies allow the Vevo Service to remember the choices you make and your account preferences and to provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies are set by us or by our third party service providers.

</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Targeting or advertising cookies: These cookies are set by us and our advertising partners to record your visit to the Vevo Service, the sections of the Vevo Service or pages you have visited and the advertisements you have viewed.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Nielsen:  We and/or our advertising partners may use Nielsen’s measurement services, which contribute to market research.  Nielsen’s pixel may be in some of the ads on the Vevo Service to track whether or not you viewed the ad and gather related information.  Nielsen uses the data it collects to create ratings reports for advertisers and publishers. To learn more about the data Nielsen collects via such pixels and your choices, please see the Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/." target="_blank"> https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/. </a>
