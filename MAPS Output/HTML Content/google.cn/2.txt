When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,”  and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-affiliates" target="_blank"> affiliates </a>.</p></div> <div><h2>  What you can expect from us</h2></div> <div><h3>  Provide a broad range of useful services</h3><ul>  <li>apps and sites (like Search and Maps)</li><li>platforms (like Google Shopping)</li><li>integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)</li><li>devices (like Google Nest)</li></ul><p>  Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.</p><p>  Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.</p></div> <div><h3>  Develop, improve, and update Google services</h3><p>  We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p></div> <p><p>  If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the <a href="terms?hl=en#taking-action" target="_blank"> Taking action in case of problems </a> section.</p></p> <div><h3>  Permission to use your content</h3><p>  Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content" target="_blank"> your content </a>. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide.

Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.</p></div> <p><p>  We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.

There are two exceptions:</p><ul>  <li>If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.</li><li>If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.</li></ul></div> <div><h1>  Using Google services</h1></div> <div><h2>  Your Google Account</h2><p>  <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en" target="_blank"> If you meet these age requirements </a> you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en" target="_blank"> create a Google Account </a> for your convenience. Some <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a> require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.</p></div> <p><p>  You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en" target="_blank"> Security Checkup </a>.</p></p> <div><h2>  Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business</h2><ul>  <li>an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms</li><li>your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you.

The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.</p></div> <div><h1>  Software in Google services</h1><p>  Some of our <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a> include downloadable software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.</p><ul>  <li>worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world</li><li>non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others</li><li>royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license</li><li>personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else</li><li>non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.</p></p> <p><p>  You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.</p></p> <div><h1>  In case of problems or disagreements</h1></div> <div><h2>  Warranty disclaimer</h2><p>  We built our reputation on providing useful, reliable services like Google Search and Maps, and we’re continuously improving our services to meet your needs. However, for legal purposes, we offer our <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a> without <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-warranty" target="_blank"> warranties </a> unless explicitly stated in our <a href="terms/service-specific?hl=en" target="_blank"> service-specific additional terms </a>. The law requires that we explain this using specific legal language and that we use capital letters to help make sure you see it, as follows:</p></div> <p><p>  TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY WARRANTIES ABOUT THE CONTENT OR FEATURES OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THEIR ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.</p></p> <div><h2>  Liabilities</h2></div> <div><h3>  For all users</h3><p>  Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law allows us to limit certain <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-liability" target="_blank"> liabilities </a> — but not others — under these terms.</p><p>  These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p><ul>  <li>Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable <a href="terms/service-specific?hl=en" target="_blank"> service-specific additional terms </a></li><li>Google isn’t liable for:</li><li>loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings</li><li>indirect or consequential losses</li><li>punitive damages</li><li>Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) $200 or (2) the fees paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the dispute</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  For business users and organizations only</h3><ul>  <li>To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-indemnify" target="_blank"> indemnify </a> Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a> or violation of these terms or <a href="terms/service-specific?hl=en" target="_blank"> service-specific additional terms </a>. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-indemnify" target="_blank"> indemnification </a>, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Taking action in case of problems</h2><p>  Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless doing so would:</p><ul>  <li>cause harm or <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-liability" target="_blank"> liability </a> to a user, third party, or Google</li><li>violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order</li><li>compromise an investigation</li><li>compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a></li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Removing your content</h3><p>  If any of <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content" target="_blank"> your content </a> (1) breaches these terms, <a href="terms/service-specific?hl=en" target="_blank"> service-specific additional terms or policies </a>, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-intellectual-property-rights" target="_blank"> intellectual property rights </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Suspending or terminating your access to Google services</h3><p>  Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:</p><ul>  <li>you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, <a href="terms/service-specific?hl=en" target="_blank"> service-specific additional terms or policies </a></li><li>we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order</li><li>your conduct causes harm or <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-liability" target="_blank"> liability </a> to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you</li></ul></div> <p><p>  For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en" target="_blank"> Help Center page </a>.

If you do stop using a service, we’d <a href="https://www.google.cn/tools/feedback?hl=en" target="_blank"> appreciate knowing why </a> so that we can continue improving our services.</p></p> <div><h2>  Settling disputes, governing law, and courts</h2><p>  For information about how to contact Google, please visit our <a href="https://www.google.cn/contact?hl=en" target="_blank"> contact page </a>.</p><p>  California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, <a href="terms/service-specific?hl=en" target="_blank"> service-specific additional terms </a>, or any related <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a>, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p></div> <div><h1>  About these terms</h1><p>  By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p><p>  These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-organization" target="_blank"> organizations </a>, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</p><p>  We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-services" target="_blank"> services </a>.

If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove <a href="terms?hl=en#footnote-your-content" target="_blank"> your content </a> and stop using the services.
