</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    It is our policy not to use or share personal data about you in ways unrelated to those described in
                    this privacy policy without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out or otherwise object to
                    such unrelated uses. However, we may disclose personal data about you, or information regarding your
                    use of the services or the Website to third parties for any of the reasons set out hereinabove, or
                    if we are legally required to do so, or if we are authorized under our contractual and statutory
                    obligations. When we disclose your personal data to service providers, we will ensure that they are
                    bound by a contract requiring them to comply with their GDPR obligations. Under the circumstances
                    referred to above, recipients of personal data may be, for example:
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>members of our corporate group which operate partner websites to the extent this is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy and to enable you to have access to certain features;</li><li>service providers;</li><li>governmental and regulatory bodies, including law enforcement authorities, in connection with
                        enquiries, proceedings or investigations by such parties or in order to enable the Company to
                        comply with its legal and regulatory requirements. We specifically reserve the right to disclose
                        any and all information to law enforcement in the event that a crime is committed or suspected
                        or if we are compelled to do so by lawful criminal, civil or administrative process, discovery
                        requests, subpoenas, court orders or writs;
                    </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>buyers or other legal successors in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring,
                        reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a
                        going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal
                        information held by us about our Website Members and Browsers is among the assets transferred.
                        Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the entity
                        to which we transfer your personal data uses it in an manner that is consistent with this
                        privacy policy; and/or
                    </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>legal or other professional consultants.

                    We may also disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify
                    any individual, without restriction. We also may share aggregated information with third-parties for
                    conducting general business analysis. This information does not contain any personal data and may be
                    used to develop content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    Please note that we have never sold and will never sell your personal data to third parties.
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>8. Members' Profile 
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    Members should be aware that all information directly provided on the Website when they create an
                    account is public and can be viewed by all other Members and Browsers of the Website, unless
                    otherwise stated. Even if a Member's profile does not contain any personal information, there is a
                    possibility of identification by others through other information on the Member's profile.
                    Accordingly, Members should understand that they are in control of all of the information they
                    upload on the Website and/or display on their profile and are fully responsible for any consequences
                    arising out of such information.
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>9. Security of your personal data 
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to
                    safeguard your personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure. For instance, only authorized
                    employees are permitted to access personal data, and they may do so only for permitted business
                    functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your personal data between your
                    system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to
                    your personal data. However, please be advised that we cannot fully eliminate security risks
                    associated with the storage and transmission of personal data as we cannot guarantee that our
                    security measures will prevent third-party hackers from illegally obtaining this information.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at
                    all times. We are not responsible for circumventions of any privacy settings or security measures
                    contained on the Website.
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>10. Information we transfer
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") so the
                    processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    Whenever we transfer your data outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded
                    to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an
                        adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
                    </li><li>Where we use service providers outside the EEA, we may use specific contracts approved by the
                        European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in the European Union.
                    </li><li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the
                        Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between
                        the European Union and the US.
                    
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    We may additionally, in rare occasions, transfer your personal data to a party outside the EEA where
                    we have your prior explicit consent to do so or where such transfer is necessary for the provision
                    of our services to you.
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>11. Marketing information
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    We may process your personal data so as to inform you about existing and/or future services that may
                    be of interest to you by sending you periodic announcements with details on existing and/or new
                    services and/or programs.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    You have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for marketing
                    purposes, by clicking at the opt-out link at the bottom of any marketing emails we send you.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    We can only use your personal data to promote our services to you if we have your explicit consent
                    to do so, or in certain cases such as for example when you are a Member of our Website, if we
                    consider that it is in our legitimate interest to do so. You may also occasionally receive marketing
                    communications from our affiliates, but only provided you have given your explicit consent in
                    receiving such communications.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    Even if you inform us that you no longer wish to receive marketing material, you will still receive
                    from us system notices and other information specifically related to your account from time to time.
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>12. How long we keep your personal data for
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    We will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected
                    it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. We
                    may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably
                    believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect of our relationship with you.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and
                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of
                    your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                    those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    Where we no longer need to process your personal data for purposes set out in this privacy policy,
                    we will delete your personal data from our systems. However, we may keep your data for longer if we
                    cannot delete it for legal, regulatory or technical reasons. If we do, we will make sure that your
                    privacy is protected and that your data are only used for those purposes.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    If you have questions about our data retention practices, please contact us electronically by

</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>13. Your data protection rights
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    We want to make sure you are aware of your rights in relation to the personal data we process about
                    you. We have described those rights and the circumstances in which they apply further below.
                
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Access </strong>: This enables you to get access or receive a copy of the personal data
                        that we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
                    </li><li><strong> Correction </strong>: If you believe that any of the information that we hold about you
                        is inaccurate or incomplete, you have a right to request that we correct the inaccurate personal
                        information.
                    </li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>
<strong> Erasure </strong>: You may request that we delete your personal information if you
                            believe that:
                        
</li><li>we no longer need to process your information for the purposes for which it was
                                provided;
                            </li><li>we have requested your permission to process your personal information and you wish to
                                withdraw your consent; or
                            </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>we are not using your information in a lawful manner.
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                            As a result of deleting your personal information, you will lose access to most of our
                            services.
                        
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Right to object </strong>: You have the right to object to the processing of your
                            personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about
                            your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. If
                            you exercise your right to object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we
                            can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your
                            interests, rights and freedom or for the establishment, exercise and defense of legal
                            claims.
                        
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, then we
                            shall stop the processing of your personal data for such purposes.
                        
</div></div> <div><div>  Depending on the circumstances, we may need to restrict or cease
                            processing your personal data altogether or, where requested, delete your personal data.
                            Please note that if you object us processing your personal data, we may have to suspend the
                            services we provide to you.
                        
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Restriction </strong>: You have the right to request the restriction of processing of
                            your personal data. This enables you to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal
                            data if:
                        
</li><li>it is not accurate; or</li><li>it has been used unlawfully but you do not want us to delete it; or</li><li>it is not relevant any more, but you want us to keep it for use in possible legal
                                claims; or
                            </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>you have already asked us to stop using your personal data but you are waiting for us to
                                confirm if we have legitimate grounds to use your personal data.
                            
</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                            Please note that if you request us to restrict processing of your personal data, we may have
                            to suspend the services we provide to you.
                        
</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Right to portability </strong>: Where we have requested your permission to process
                            your personal data or you have provided us with information for the purposes of entering
                            into a contract with us, you have the right to receive the personal data you provided to us
                            in a portable format. You may also request us to provide it directly to a third party, if
                            technically feasible. We are not responsible for any such third party's use of your account
                            information, which will be governed by their agreement with you and any privacy statement
                            they provided to you.
                        

</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    If we ask for your consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
                    Please note that in case of a withdrawal of your consent you may no longer be able to use several
                    functionalities of our Website and our services.
                
</div></div> <div><div>  
                    Please note that some requests to delete certain personal data will require the deletion of your
                    account as a Member as the provision of Member accounts is inextricably linked to the use of certain
                    personal data (e.g. your email address). Also note that it is possible that we require additional
                    information from you in order to verify your authorization to make the request and to honor your

</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
                    As of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") provides California
                    residents ("Consumer(s)") certain rights with respect to their personal information, as this term
                    is defined under the CCPA. In addition to the rights we state under this policy and subject to the
                    exceptions found under the CCPA, Consumers have the right to:

                    </div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
                            opt-out of the sale of their personal information, should we sell their personal information;

                            be informed of certain information concerning our collection and use of their personal information;
                        </li><li>

                        </li><li>
                            appoint an agent to exercise their rights provided for by the CCPA, provided that a duly
                            executed notarized power of attorney is presented and provided that the agent has information
                            deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the identity of the Consumer in question and to
                            locate his/her information in our systems;
                        </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
                            Not be subjected to discrimination for the exercise of these rights. We will not deny

                        This Website does not sell nor has it sold in the past 12 months personal information to third

                        information with third parties, service providers and entities within our corporate group in
                        order to enable them to perform certain services on our behalf and namely to make the Website
                        work properly. Regardless, we respect the California residents' right to exclude personal
                        information from such sharing arrangements and to thereby opt-out of any future sale of their

                        preference, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:help@xhamster.com" target="_blank"> help@xhamster.com </a>.
