</div><div>  
Customer Interactions with Sonos

</div><div>  
To make the information in this Statement easy to understand, we have highlighted different occasions when Sonos could potentially collect personal information from customers. The relevant sections in the Statement apply to you to the extent you use certain Products and/or Services and they are made available to you in your region. The customer interactions with Sonos are broken down into the following segments:




</div></div> <div><div>  
Learning about Sonos

</div><div>  
As you gather more information about Sonos, you may virtually or physically visit a site that we own. Examples include browsing our website, calling our in-house sales representatives, physically visiting a Sonos-owned store or attending Sonos-sponsored events. To learn more about Sonos Products, you may voluntarily provide personal information, such as your name and email address during these interactions. We may also collect information about you online via <a href="#legal-privacy-cookies-container" target="_blank"> cookies or similar technologies </a> when you visit our websites.<strong> We collect: </strong> name, email address, IP address, and information provided by cookies or similar technology.<strong> Why: </strong> We use this information to share news about events and products offered by Sonos. Additionally, the IP address helps us to understand geographic information about our websites’ visitors better so that we can improve our website for everyone. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes.




</div></div> <div><div>  
Buying Sonos Products and Services

</div><div>  
Once you have decided to buy a Sonos Product and/or Service, we offer a way for customers to buy directly from us at www.sonos.com or at a Sonos retail store. When you buy from us, you will be asked to provide information so that we can complete your purchase.<strong> We collect: </strong> your name, phone number (optional), email address, delivery/shipping address, and payment information.<strong> Why: </strong> We use this information to complete your transaction, follow up with you about your purchase, help with any delivery issues, handle returns, and other issues related to the purchase of your Sonos Products and/or Services. Processing your personal data for this purpose is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. <strong> Please note, we do not store any payment or credit card information. We only use payment information in connection with the purchase of Sonos Products and Services. </strong>




</div></div> <div><div>  
Registering your Sonos System

</div><div>  
Once you receive your Sonos Products, you will be required to connect your Product to a network at home. Each Sonos Product needs to be connected to the internet for setup. As part of the initial setup, you will be asked to download the Sonos control app from either our website or a third-party website, such as the Google Play Store. The Sonos app allows you to control your Sonos system from the device of your choice (for example your phone or tablet). During the setup process, the Sonos app will ask you to set up an account and register your system with Sonos. <strong> You must register your Sonos Products in order for them to work. </strong>As part of registering your Sonos Product, the app will prompt you to enter information such as an email address and location data (country, postcode) which is required to provide this information to register your Sonos system. Your Sonos system will then establish a unique alpha-numeric identification number which we use to help identify your specific Sonos system in a less personal manner. This identification number will be associated with the email address that you provide along with the Product serial number and the IP address from where the Product connected. As part of registration, you will need to set up a Sonos account. We collect your password to your Sonos account which is only used for authentication and Sonos account access.<strong> We collect: </strong> your name, phone number, email address, location data, your password and IP address. Please note, your password is stored using one-way hash, which means that it cannot be recovered (or disclosed) by anyone, including Sonos.<strong> Why: </strong> We collect this information to help get your Sonos Product and/or Service working securely (which helps prevent unauthorized access to your Sonos Products, Services or home network) and to make sure that we enable you to select the right music service options based on your geographic location (e.g. radio stations available in your country). This processing is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you. We also use your email to send you Sonos-related notifications, such as promotional messages, software updates, information about Sonos Products and/or Services, and to share exciting Sonos news and Product offerings. It is our legitimate interest to process your personal data for these purposes.




</div></div> <div><div>  
Using Sonos Products and Services

</div><div>  
At Sonos we believe you can enjoy great Products and Services without compromising your privacy. Learn more about how we use your personal information <a href="#legal-2023-privacy-use-info-container" target="_blank"> here </a>.There are three main reasons we collect information from your Sonos Products: (1) to offer you music services or other audio content choices (e.g. radio, tv or games) which is necessary for the performance of the agreement we have with you, (2) to offer you control over your Sonos system (e.g. app, voice) which is necessary for the performance of the contract we have with you, and (3) to make your Sonos Products and Services better over time which is our legitimate interest.Using Sonos Products involves selecting audio content to play in the rooms or spaces of your choice. Although you can play free internet radio or music files stored locally on your home network (for example on your computer’s hard drive), most Sonos owners prefer to add a streaming music service for playback via their Sonos Products. Examples include Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, and other audio content services. The addition of any of these music services requires you to link your individual music service to your Sonos system. Once you have started playing music or other audio content on your Sonos Products, the data we receive is dependent on your preferences.When you use Sonos Products and/or Service, including but not limited to downloading a firmware/software update, connecting to third party product and/or service such as music streaming or voice control services, selecting audio content to play in the rooms or spaces of your choice and/or otherwise interacting with Sonos Products and/or Services we may collect, depending on your preference and/or settings, a variety of personal and non-personal information, including:</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Contact Information. </strong> Data such as name, email address, or other contact information.</li><li><strong> Sonos Account Information. </strong> Your Sonos account and related account details such as profile information, order history (if/when you buy Sonos products via sonos.com website), products, room names, applicable subscriptions to Services or Sonos Beta program, and other information described here.</li><li><strong> Product and Service Functionality and Usage. </strong> Certain Sonos Products, software (e.g. Sonos app) and Services (e.g. Sonos Radio and/or Sonos Voice Control) automatically collect, store and/or may otherwise process necessary information in order to operate and perform their basic functions in a secure way. This information may include product and third party device identifiers (e.g. device manufacturer and model, OS type and version), technical configuration data and other non-personal information. Some of this information may be transmitted to Sonos’ servers. When you use your Sonos Product(s), basic application installation information will also be collected automatically.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Functional Data. </strong> This data is absolutely necessary for your Sonos Product and/or Service, including Sonos Radio and Sonos Voice Control, to perform its basic functions in a secure way and <strong> you will not be able to opt out from this data collection, sharing and/or processing if you want to continue to use your Sonos Products and Services. </strong> Depending on your settings we may collect:</li><li>Registration data. This data includes your email address, location, language preference, Product serial number, IP address, and Sonos account login information (as described above).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>System data. This data includes things like Product type, controller device type, controller operating system, software version, content source (audio line in), signal input (e.g. whether your TV outputs a specific audio signal such as Dolby to your Sonos system), information about WiFi antennas, system settings (such as equalization or stereo pair), Product orientation, names of the music service(s) you added/enabled on your Sonos product, the names you have given your Sonos Product in different rooms, whether your Product has been tuned using Sonos Trueplay technology, system performance metrics (e.g. the temperature of your Product or WiFi signal strength) and error information.<strong> Why we collect Functional Data: </strong></li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Additional Usage Data. </strong> In order to improve your experience with Sonos Products and to offer better, personalized Sonos Products and Services, including Sonos Radio and Sonos Voice Control, that meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we collect the following Additional Usage Data. The processing of this information is in our legitimate interest as further set out below (under Why). You can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed <a href="#legal-privacy-rights-choices" target="_blank"> here </a>. Depending on your settings and/or the feature(s) which you enabled, we may collect:</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Performance Information. This includes things like the temperature of your Product, WiFi information like signal strength, how often you use music services you have connected to your Sonos system (including, for some services, your login username, but not password); the controller configuration data such as (1) app preferences which capture the state of different settings inside the Sonos app, information about how often you use the Sonos app versus other control mechanisms, flow of interactions within the Sonos app, and (2) controller device settings which capture the state of device-level (e.g. iOS, Android) settings that affect our app (e.g. the state of the system-level permission for Bluetooth, location, etc.); how often you use the physical controls on the unit; duration of Sonos Product use, and, as required for certain Services location-based data using GPS (or similar technology, where available) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi access points and cell tower locations collected from your third party device when the Sonos app is in use.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Activity Information. This includes duration of music service use, Product or room grouping information, command information (such as play, pause, change volume, or skip tracks), information about playlist or station container data including listening history (‘Recently Played’); and Sonos playlist or Sonos favorites information; each correlated to individual Sonos Products and your interactions with them. If you enable voice control or use Sonos Radio, we will additionally collect information about track data when using those features.<strong> Why: </strong> We collect this information so that we can help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalized experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products. Additionally, to provide Sonos Radio, we collect location-based information for licensing and reporting purposes. Collecting this data is our legitimate interest to support a user-friendly experience that meets your needs and help you with issues you may experience. It is your choice if you want us to collect this information, and therefore you can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed <a href="#legal-privacy-rights-container" target="_blank"> here </a>.<strong> Note: </strong> personalization services (e.g. Recently Played), Sonos Radio, Sonos Voice Control, third party Voice Control and Direct Control functionality require some of the Additional Usage Data to function. If you decide to use any of these features and/or Services, the Additional Usage Data becomes functional and you will not be able to opt out of it if you choose to use these features. You can always clear all Recently Played by following the instructions in the Sonos app.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Direct Control via Third Party App(s) and/or Third Party Voice Functionality Data. </strong> As the world and our homes become more connected, we realize that our customers may prefer to control their Sonos Products by means other than their Sonos app, for example by using a voice-enabled product (such as Amazon Alexa), through a home control mechanism (for example, a Lutron Pico remote), or through the app offered by their favorite music service.</li><li>To enable these functions, if available to you, you will be prompted to allow such devices to connect with your Sonos system (similar to the process you go through to connect a music service). Once a particular function is enabled, we collect and process the Functional Data, the Additional Usage Data and certain Audio Data. Sonos will share a subset of this data with the partner/s that provide/s the services you have requested.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Sharing your relevant data with these partners and further processing such data is necessary for the performance of the contracts with these partners for your benefit, in order to ensure that the voice or direct control function is working properly. This information is needed to fulfill the agreement we have with you, to ensure proper functionality and to help improve these features which is also our legitimate interest.</li><li>If you wish to object to any such processing, simply disable the feature (for example, disable voice control) or unlink the feature (for example, unlink your home automation remote) from your Sonos Products. The voice control function or other direct control functionality will not work unless you authorize us to collect and process the data as outlined in this section.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Audio Data. </strong> There are only two occasions when we will capture sound from within your home: (a) when you enable voice control technology on a voice-enabled Sonos Product (such as Sonos One or Beam); and (b) when you utilize our innovative Trueplay room tuning technology.</li><li><strong> Sonos Voice Control and Third Party Voice Control </strong></li><li>Please note, not all Sonos Products are voice enabled. If your Sonos Product is voice enabled, you will have to actively enable voice control for your Sonos Product for it to function. Voice control works by your voice-enabled Sonos Product 'listening' for a key wake-up word. In greater depth, this means that the voice-enabled Sonos Product continuously buffers (stores data for the time that it is being processed) locally, without transmitting or storing any information, unless it detects the word or phrase (such as “Hey Sonos” or “Alexa”) that triggers the device to begin actively recording. If the Product does not detect the wake-up word, it continues to record over itself in a never-ending loop lasting a few seconds. This is all done locally on your Sonos Product and is not sent to Sonos or any third party. If a wake-up word is detected, the Sonos Product begins recording. In other words, it does not record or retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is 'woken up.' You are notified that it is recording by a visual element, such as a light on the Sonos Product, and/or a specific sound.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If the detected wake-up word is “Hey Sonos”, your voice command is processed locally on your product and no audio data will be saved. <strong> Sonos does not retain a copy or transcript of your voice recording. </strong></li><li>If the wake word is the one of a Third Party Voice service you have activated, the actual recording of your voice command is then sent to the voice partner you have authorized to receive such recording (for example, Amazon). <strong> Sonos does not retain a copy or transcript of your voice recording. </strong> Use of any Third Party Voice service is subject to the third-party’s terms of use or service and their respective privacy notices. We encourage you to read these third-party terms carefully before you enable them on your Sonos Products.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Concurrent with the voice recording, Sonos Product will collect data (for example, decibel level at each frequency) about the ambient noise in the room. It is not possible to extract any speech from this type of data. We collect this data to help us improve our speech recognition technology which is our legitimate interest. If you are trying to state a voice command while music is playing, for example, Sonos may improve the technology by lowering the music so that your voice command can be understood properly.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Trueplay room tuning </strong></li><li>Trueplay analyzes acoustic factors that can impact sound quality in the room where your Sonos Product is placed. You will have to actively enable Trueplay. The purpose of the Trueplay analysis is to alter the audio output of Sonos Products in a manner that enhances the sound. To do this, a user goes through an interactive process (watch the video here) that gathers certain data about your speaker setup (for example, the number of speakers and speaker placement), including information about background noise levels and the room acoustics (for example decibel level at each frequency). This information is used to help make sure that the tuning gives you the best outcome possible. For example, if your dog barks during the Trueplay testing, the Sonos Product knows to ignore the background noise of a barking dog during the testing. The collection of this data is necessary for the fulfillment of the agreement we have with you if you activate Trueplay.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Auto Trueplay. Once enabled, some of the Products can automatically adjust their sound for your environment with Auto Trueplay (“Auto Trueplay”). Auto Trueplay starts tuning as soon as you begin playing audio. It automatically re-tunes as you play content and bring your Auto Trueplay enabled Product to different locations.</li><li><strong> Location Information. </strong> Your general geographic location as indicated by your IP address, your country and/or postcode when you register your Products to make sure that we enable you to select the right music service options based on your geographic location (e.g. radio stations available in your country, language). Learn more about location data used to enable Sonos Radio <a href="#legal-privacy-use-info-radio" target="_blank"> here </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Other Information you provide to us. </strong> Details such as the content of your communications with Sonos, including interactions with customer support and contacts through social media channels.You are not required to provide all personal data that we have requested. However, if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our Products or Services or respond to requests you may have.




</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  
Getting Help from Sonos

</div><div>  
From time to time, you may decide to contact our Customer Care group for assistance with your Sonos Products and/or Services. To be able to offer you the best service possible, we may collect certain data from you or your Sonos Products.<strong> We collect: </strong> This may include contact information, such as your name, email address, phone number, social media identifiers (if you contact us using a social media channel), and the content of your chats and other communications with Sonos Customer Care (including, in some cases, voice recording if you call Customer Care). In certain situations, it is useful for the Customer Care team to have a 'Diagnostic' of your Sonos system. This is essentially a technical system snapshot of all relevant information leading up to the incident and includes information such as the music service being used, volume level, Product configuration, WiFi signal and router information, error codes, device information (e.g. the operating system, and version of the Sonos app being used). Collecting the above described information is necessary to provide customer support. You will be informed in advance before we make a snapshot. We do not capture snapshots without telling you first. If you are a Beta tester, we take a daily diagnostic of your Sonos system automatically (per the terms of the Beta tester agreement).<strong> Why: </strong> We collect this information to give you the best and most efficient customer support possible. For instance, for customer inquiries and technical questions, we use the contact information to respond to the customer in their preferred channel (phone, email, social). For technical problems, we use system diagnostic data to effectively troubleshoot the issue. For product returns and/or exchanges, we use the contact information to ensure successful product receipt and/or delivery. Using these types of your data is necessary to fulfill the agreement we have with you.

Advertising and Modern Marketing Tools

To help more people listen to more music on Sonos, we use several modern marketing tools in support of our advertising efforts.Sonos may work with third-party advertisers that use <a href="#legal-privacy-cookies-container" target="_blank"> cookies and similar technologies </a> to provide more relevant advertising about Sonos Products and Services on our websites and across the internet. To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine information about your online activities acquired over time, which help cater advertising that we deliver to you.

We may obtain your consent to this process depending on local law.

Sale and Sharing of Personal Information

</div><div>  
During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Statement, we may have provided personal information (i.e., hashed email address and cookie related information) to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes, so that we can provide you with more relevant and tailored ads regarding our Products and Services, or use analytics partners to assist us in analyzing use of our services and our user/customer base. The disclosure of your personal information to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA, or the “sharing” of your personal information for purposes of “cross-context behavioral advertising.”The following chart lists the categories of personal information we have sold or shared over the last 12 months and the categories of third parties to which we have sold or shared:</div></div> <td><td>  Information about your computer or device, including IP address, time and date of visit, browser type and version, operating system, device make and model.</td></td> <div><ul>  <li>Advertising partners and advertisers</li><li>Unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes</li><li>Analytics providers</li><li>Advertising partners and advertisers</li></ul><td>  Contact information, such as hashed email address.</td><ul>  <li>Advertising partners and advertisers</li><li>Unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes</li><li>Analytics providers</li><li>Advertising partners and advertisers</li></ul><td>  IP address, zip code, Sonos device type (e.g. Beam, One, Arc, etc.), genre of the station you are currently listening to, listener ID, language</td></div> <div><ul>  <li>Advertising partners and advertisers</li><li>Unaffiliated third parties for their advertising purposes</li><li>Analytics providers</li><li>Advertising partners and advertisers

Your CCPA Right to Opt Out of “Sale” or “Sharing” of Personal Information

</div><div>  
Californians have a right to direct us not to “sell” or “share” certain personal information as those terms are defined in the CCPA. You can exercise that right by following the steps on our Your Privacy Choices page.Your browser may also offer a way to activate the Global Privacy Control signal (“GPC”). Our websites each treat qualifying browsers for which the user has activated the GPC signal as having opted out of what CCPA calls a “sale” of any California personal information that is collected on that site from that browser using cookies and similar technology. You can override that treatment for a GPC-enabled browser by using the cookie controls available from the website’s footer.Opting out of “sales” and “sharing” limits only some types of disclosures of personal information, and there are exceptions to all of the rights described in this section.Please note that we do not “sell” or “share” personal information (as those terms are defined under the CCPA) if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 16 years of age.RetentionWe retain your information only for as long as is necessary to provide the Services and to fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other necessary purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes (including complying with legal requirement to maintain records of deletion requests). If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. We may retain cached or archived copies of your information.Your CCPA Information, Correction, Deletion, and Other RightsThe CCPA allows you to request us to:</div></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Inform you about the categories of personal information we have collected about you in the preceding 12 months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we have disclosed certain personal information, and more specific detail about what categories of information were “sold,” “shared” or disclosed to particular categories of third parties, similar to the detail above this section of the Privacy Statement;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about you;</li><li>Correct certain personal information we have about you; and</li><li>Delete certain personal information we have about you.If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you may submit your request via email to privacy@sonos.com and through our toll free number at 1-800-680-2345.Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain information to provide our services to you, so we may reject a deletion request for that information while providing services to you.Verification of Requests to Exercise CCPA RightsWe may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before responding to your request, which may include, depending on the sensitivity of the information involved, the nature of our relationship with you, and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, and other information regarding your use of our services.Requests Made by AgentsYou can designate an authorized agent to make a CCPA request on your behalf. To do so, we must receive a legally sufficient power of attorney signed by you pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130, or other written authorization acceptable to us, for the agent to act on your behalf. You may still need to verify your identity and confirm the agent’s authority directly with us if we are not convinced of the validity of the agent’s request. For security and legal reasons, we may refuse to accept requests that require us to visit an agent’s website. Because opt-out requests for sales made through cookies and related technology must be performed from each browser that is used to access our services, it is easiest for the consumer to perform such opt-outs themselves. However, if you wish for an agent to perform browser-based requests on your behalf, you may arrange for the agent to your consumer’s browser to make such requests, but you may not share your login credentials or logged-in access to our websites with an agent or any other third party. We are not responsible for the security risks of giving an agent browser access or any other arrangements that you may have with an agent.NondiscriminationYou also have a right not to receive “discriminatory treatment” (within the meaning of the CCPA) for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA.NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVESWe may offer incentives, such as a coupon or discount on purchase in exchange for personal information (e.g., email sign-up). We may also offer a loyalty program that will provide certain perks, such as rewards and exclusive offers, as well as other programs like sweepstakes or contests. We generally do not assign monetary or other value to personal information. If, however, we are required by law to assign such value, we have valued the personal information collected and used based in part on the value of consumer trial of new products and sharing future offers tailored to your interest with competitive value. The value is a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal information collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the transferability of such personal information for us, (iii) the discounted price offered, (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our programs, and (v) the product or service to which the programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards.
