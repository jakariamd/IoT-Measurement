YOUR CHOICES</h4><p>  <strong> Email Marketing </strong>
You may unsubscribe from Simplifi’s promotional emails at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” on the emails you receive from us.</p><p>  <strong> Opting Out of Simplifi Targeted Advertising on Your Browser </strong>
Simplifi collects data on the Site and across non-affiliated websites and apps to deliver more relevant advertising to you. This process is called interest-based advertising. Simplifi also collects information about potential relationships among different devices for interest-based advertising. If you would like to stop receiving interest-based advertising on your browser from Simplifi, <a href="https://optout.simpli.fi/opt-out" target="_blank"> click here </a>. By doing so, Simplifi will replace your unique cookie with an “opt-out” cookie. An opt-out choice means that we no longer use or transfer data from the opted out browser for targeted advertisements, and we no longer use data collected on other devices to inform advertisements on that device. We will still collect and store information through such cookies for other purposes such as metrics and analytics and we may still serve you advertising but it will not be tailored for you. Because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser or device, you will need to make your opt-out choice on each browser or device that you use. To do so, point each browser that you use to this page, and click on the disable link above. Please note that you will need to set the Simplifi opt-out cookie again in some cases, for example, under the following circumstances: You buy a new device, delete cookies from your browser, or upgrade or change the browser of your existing computer or device.</p></div> <p><p>  Simplifi is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. Additional information on the NAI and its code can be viewed at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code" target="_blank"> http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Simplifi also licenses the AdChoices icon from the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) at <a href="http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/" target="_blank"> http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/ </a> and the DAAC at <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank"> http://youradchoices.ca </a> for the purpose of providing enhanced notice and to inform users when they are being behaviorally targeted and to provide an opportunity to opt out.</p></p> <p><p>  Simplifi makes every effort to ensure adherence to the self-regulatory principles of the DAA and the DAAC.
For information about opting out of Simplifi’s other interest-based advertising activities outside the Site, please see our Services Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> JavaScript </strong>
We also use JavaScript to assist us with the collection and use of browsing data, including IP address and cookie identifiers, for interest-based advertising activities.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Do Not Track </strong>
We currently honor Do Not Track signals transmitted by browsers by treating this signal as an opt out of interest-based advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Third-Party Targeted Advertising </strong>
We partner with one or more third parties to display advertising on our Site and/or to manage our advertising on other sites. Such third parties may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other unrelated sites over time in order to provide you with more relevant advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. This is called interest-based advertising. Simpli.fi complies with the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles and the NAI Code of Conduct in connection with this activity on our Site. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out with respect to companies participating in industry self-regulation by clicking <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank"> http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1 </a> or <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank"> http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/ </a>, or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank"> http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ </a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive ads, but they will not be targeted based on your browsing activity.</p></p> <div><h4>  7. ACCESSING YOUR INFORMATION</h4><p>  You may request to access your Personal Information that we hold, as well as to correct, amend or delete information when it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles or when otherwise required by law.

We will respond to these requests in accordance with the laws that apply to you and within a reasonable timeframe. You can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your information. We may deny a request in some cases when permitted by law, such as when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.</p></div> <div><h4>  8. INTERNATIONAL OR CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4><p>  By providing Personal Information and/or by communicating with us by email, you acknowledge and expressly consent to our processing and disclosure of your Personal Information outside your country.

EU DATA SUBJECTS: PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4><p>  We process Personal Information with your consent. On other occasions, we may process Personal Information when we need to do so to fulfill a contract (for example, for billing purposes) or where required to do this by law. If necessary, we may also process Personal Information when it is in our legitimate interests to do this (e.g., for auditing purposes or for fraud detection) and when these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.</p></div> <p><p>  EU data subjects may have rights to access, portability, to revoke consent, to correct, delete, and/or object to or restrict processing of the Personal Information you provide to us. You can email a request to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@simpli.fi" target="_blank"> privacy@simpli.fi </a>. We will respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with the law that applies to you. Sometimes a request in relation to your Personal Information may not apply to certain information, such as information we may keep to comply with legal requirements.</p></p> <p><p>  Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint against us. To do so, contact the supervisory authority in your country of residence.</p></p> <div><h4>  10.
