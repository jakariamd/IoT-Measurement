People use our services to enable their purchases and businesses of all sizes use our technology and services to accept payments, send payouts, and manage their businesses online. Stripe wants to be clear about our use of the Personal Data that is entrusted to us.</p><p>  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the “Personal Data” that we collect about you, how we use it, how we share it, your rights and choices, and how you can contact us about our privacy practices. This Policy also outlines your data subject rights, including the right to object to some uses of your Personal Data by us. Please visit the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal" target="_blank"> Stripe Privacy Center </a> for more information about our privacy practices.</p></div> <p><p>  “Stripe”, “we”, “our” or “us” means the Stripe entity responsible for the collection and use of Personal Data under this Privacy Policy. It differs depending on your jurisdiction. <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal#which-stripe-entities-are-involved" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  “Personal Data” means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and can include information that you provide to us and that we collect about you, such as when you engage with our Services (e.g. device information, IP address).</p></p> <p><p>  “Services” means the products and services that Stripe indicates are covered by this Policy, which may include Stripe-provided devices and apps. Our “Business Services” are Services provided by Stripe to entities (“Business Users”) who directly and indirectly provide us with “End Customer” Personal Data in connection with those Business Users’ own business and activities. Our “End User Services” are those Services which Stripe provides directly to people (rather than entities) for their own use. </p></p> <p><p>  “Sites” means Stripe.com and the other websites, apps and online services that Stripe indicates are covered by this Policy. Collectively, we refer to Sites, Business Services and End User Services as “Services”.</p></p> <p><p>  Depending on the context, “you” means End Customer, End User, Representative or Visitor:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>When you directly use an End User Service for your personal use (such as when you sign up for Link, or make a payment to Stripe Climate in your personal capacity), we refer to you as an “End User.”</li><li>When you do business with, or otherwise transact with, a Business User (e.g. when you buy a pair of shoes from a merchant that uses <a href="https://stripe.com/checkout" target="_blank"> Stripe Checkout </a> for payment processing) but are not directly doing business with Stripe, we refer to you as an “End Customer.”</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>When you are acting on behalf of an existing or potential Business User (e.g. you are a founder of a company, administer an account for a merchant who is a Business User, or receive an employee credit card from a Business User using Stripe Issuing), we refer to you as a “Representative.”</li><li>When you visit a Site without being logged into a Stripe account or otherwise communicate with Stripe, we refer to you as a “Visitor.” (e.g. you send Stripe a message asking for more information because you are considering being a user of our products).</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Depending on the activity, Stripe acts as a “data controller” and/or “data processor (or service provider)” and for more information about this and on the Stripe entity that is responsible under this Policy, see <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#is-stripe-acting-as-a-data-controller-or-a-data-processor" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <div><h2>  <strong> 1. Personal Data that we collect and how we use and share it </strong></h2><p>  Our collection and use of Personal Data changes depending on whether you are acting as End User, End Customer, Representative or Visitor and our different Services.  For example, if you are the sole owner of a business (i.e., sole proprietorship), we may collect Personal Data to onboard your business, but you may also be an End Customer that purchased goods from another Business User that uses Stripe’s Services for payment processing and you may also be an End User who uses Link to make those purchases.  </p></div> <p><p>  “<strong> Transaction Data </strong>” as used in this Privacy Policy includes Personal Data, and may include the following: your name, email address, billing address, shipping address, payment method information (such as credit or debit card number, bank account information or payment card image selected by you), merchant and location, purchase amount, date of purchase, and in some cases, some information about what you have purchased and your phone number and past purchases.</p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> 1.1 End Users </strong></h3><p>  We provide End User Services where we do not act as a service provider or processor to Businesses but instead provide the Services directly to you for your personal use (e.g. Link). We provide more information about our collection, use and sharing of Personal Data in our <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal" target="_blank"> Privacy Center </a>, including the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal#end-users" target="_blank"> legal bases </a> which we rely on for using (processing) your Personal Data.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> a. Personal Data that we collect about End Users </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Using Link or Connecting your Bank Account. </strong> Stripe offers you the opportunity to store your payment methods with Stripe so that you can conveniently use it across merchants who are our Business Users (“Link” was formerly known as “Remember Me”). When you opt in to Link, you agree to let us store your Personal Data such as your payment method so that you can more readily make purchases through Link with Business Users of our payment processing Business Services (e.g. name, contact information, payment method details (e.g. card number, cvc, and expiration date)). When you choose to pay with Link, we will also collect Transaction Data related to your transactions. <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal#link" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If you choose to share bank account information (including for use in Link) with us, Stripe will periodically collect and process your account information (e.g. bank account owner information, account balances, account number and details, account transactions and, in some cases, credentials). With your separate permission, we will share this Personal Data with Business Users that you choose.  You can ask us to stop collecting and sharing this information.  <a href="https://support.stripe.com/how-to-disconnect-a-linked-financial-account" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>.   </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>With your separate permission, we will share contact information (e.g. shipping address, billing address and phone number) with Business Users that you do business with. </li><li><strong> Paying Stripe. </strong> If you are buying goods or services directly from Stripe, we receive Transaction Data. For example, when you make a payment to Stripe Climate, we will collect contact information, payment method information, and information about that transaction.</li><li>I<strong> dentity/Verification Services. </strong> We provide an identity verification service that automates comparing an identity document with your image (e.g., selfie).  You may choose to opt-in to allow us to store that verification for future use across other merchants and/or separately consent to letting us use your biometric data to improve our verification technology. You can also ask us to stop providing you these services.  <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#verification-consent" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> More.  </strong>Please see <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy#2-more-ways-we-collect-use-and-share-personal-data" target="_blank"> below </a> for information about additional types of Personal Data that we may collect about End Users, including about your online activity and how you engage with our End User Services.  </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Users </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Services. </strong> We use your Personal Data to provide the End User Service to you, including security, sanctions screening, delivery, support, personalization (e.g. language preferences and settings choices) and messages related to the End User Service (e.g. communicating Policy updates and information about our Services). For example, we will use Personal Data to assess whether your use of Link to make a payment with a merchant is authorized by you (and not a bad actor) and likely to be successfully authorized by the payment method you choose to use when you choose to make purchases with Link.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Our Business Users. </strong> When you choose to connect your financial account with Stripe you may also choose to share account information with Business Users that you do business with. These Business Users will have their own privacy policies which describe how they use that information.</li><li><strong> Transactions. </strong> For payment transactions with Link, End User Personal Data is shared with others to enable or “process” the transaction. For example, when you choose to use a payment method for the transaction with Stripe or with Link (e.g. credit card, debit card, buy now pay later, or direct debit), the third party provider of your payment method will receive Transaction Data that includes your Personal Data. When you use Link, the merchant you choose to do business with will also receive Transaction Data that includes your Personal Data and, with your separate consent, your bank account information. Please review the privacy policies of your payment method and the merchants who you choose to learn more about their processing of your Personal Data.  </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention. </strong> We use your Personal Data collected across our Services (e.g. Stripe Radar) to detect fraud and prevent financial losses for you, us, and our Business Users and financial partners, including to detect unauthorized purchases. <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#from-where-does-stripe-collect-information-used-for-fraud-prevention-and-security-purposes" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>. We may provide Business Users and financial partners (including card issuers, payment methods and others involved in payment processing activities) that use our fraud Business Services with Personal Data about you (including your attempted transactions) so that they can assess the associated fraud or loss risk with a transaction. You can learn more about how we may use technology to assess the fraud risk associated with an attempted transaction and what information we share with Business Users <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/radar/reviews/risk-insights" target="_blank"> here </a>. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Advertising. </strong> We may use your Personal Data to assess your eligibility for, and offer you, other End User Services or promote existing End User Services. Where allowed by law (including with your opt-in consent where required), we use and share End User Personal Data with others so that we may market our End User Services to you, including through interest-based advertising. See our <a href="https://stripe.com/cookies-policy/legal" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>. </li><li>We do not sell or share End User Personal Data with third parties for marketing or advertising their products without your separate consent.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> More. </strong> Please see <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy#2-more-ways-we-collect-use-and-share-personal-data" target="_blank"> below </a> for information about additional ways in which we may use and share your Personal Data.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  <strong> 1.2 End Customers </strong></h3><p>  Stripe offers Business Services to our Business Users (e.g. payment processing through in-person or online checkout, or processing pay-outs for those Business Users). When we are acting as a Business User’s service provider (also known as a data processor), we will process Personal Data in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the Business User and the Business User’s lawful instructions (e.g. when we process a payment for a Business User because you bought a product from them) or they instruct us to send funds to you. </p></div> <p><p>  Business Users are responsible for making sure that their End Customers’ privacy rights are respected, including ensuring appropriate disclosures about data collection and use that happens in connection with their products and services. If you are an End Customer, please refer to the privacy policy or notice of the Business User you choose to do business with for information regarding their privacy practices, choices and controls.  We provide more information about our collection, use and sharing of Personal Data in our <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal" target="_blank"> Privacy Center </a>, including the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal#end-customers" target="_blank"> legal bases </a> which we rely on for using (processing) your Personal Data.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> a. Personal Data that we collect about End Customers </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Transaction Data. </strong> If you are an End Customer, when you make payments to, get refunds from, begin a purchase, make a donation or otherwise transact with a Business User that uses us to provide payment processing Business Services, we will receive Transaction Data. We may also receive your transaction history with the Business User. <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#end-customers" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>. Moreover, we may obtain information typed into a checkout form, even if you choose not to complete the form or purchase with the Business User. <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#promotional-emails-feature" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Identity/Verification Information. </strong> Stripe provides a verification and fraud prevention Service that allows a Business User to verify Personal Data about you, such as your age (when purchasing age restricted goods) or your authorization to use a payment method. As part of these Services, you will be asked to share Personal Data with us for this purpose (e.g., your government ID, your image (selfie), and Personal Data you input or that is apparent from the physical payment method (e.g. credit card image)). To protect against fraud, we may compare this information with information about you we collect from Business Users, financial partners, business partners, identity verification services, publicly available sources, and other third party service providers and sources so that we can assess whether the person is likely to be you or a person purporting to be you. <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal#stripe-identity" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> More. </strong> Please see <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy#2-more-ways-we-collect-use-and-share-personal-data" target="_blank"> below </a> for information about additional types of Personal Data that we may collect, including your online activity.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> b. How we use and share Personal Data of End Customers </strong></p></p> <p><p>  To provide our Business Services to our Business Users, we use Personal Data, and share Personal Data of a Business User’s End Customers with the Business User.  Where allowed, we also use End Customers’ Personal Data for Stripe’s own purposes to secure, improve and provide our Business Services and prevent fraud, loss and other harms as described below.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Payments and Accounting. </strong> We use your Transaction Data to provide our Payments related Business Services to Business Users, including to process online payment transactions, to calculate applicable sales tax, to invoice and bill, and to help them calculate their revenue, pay their bills and perform accounting tasks. <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/privacy-center#end-customers" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>. We may also use Personal Data to provide and improve our Business Services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>For payment transactions, your Personal Data is shared with a number of parties in connection with your transaction. Because we act as a service provider or processor, we share Personal Data to enable the transaction. For example, when you choose to use a payment method for the transaction (e.g. credit card, debit card, buy now pay later, or direct debit), your payment method will receive the Transaction Data that includes your Personal Data. Please review your payment method’s privacy policy to learn more about how they use and share this information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The merchant you choose to do business with will also receive Transaction Data that includes your Personal Data and the merchant may share that Personal Data with others. Please review your merchant’s privacy policy to learn more.</li><li><strong> Financial Services. </strong> Some of our Business Users use our Services in order to offer financial services to you, through Stripe or its financial partners. For example, they may provide a card product that enables you to purchase goods and services. These cards may carry the Stripe brand, bank partner brand and/or the brands of Business Users. In addition to any Transaction Data we may produce or receive when these cards are used for purchases, we will also receive and use your Personal Data in order to provide and manage these products. Please also see the privacy policies of the Business User and our bank partners, if applicable, associated with the financial service (whose brands may be shown on the card).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>I<strong> dentity/Verification Services. </strong> We use Personal Data about your identity, including information provided by you and our service providers, to perform verification Services for Stripe or for the Business Users that you are doing business with, to reduce fraud and enhance security. If you provide a “selfie” along with an image of your identity document, we will use technology to compare and calculate whether they match and you can be verified. <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity" target="_blank"> Learn More </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Fraud Detection and Loss Prevention. </strong> We use your Personal Data collected across our Services (e.g. Stripe Radar) to detect and prevent losses for you, us, our Business Users and financial partners.

This includes sharing Personal Data of End Customers with Business Users when a Business User authorizes a third party application provider to access its Stripe account using Stripe Connect. For example, when the Business User uses Identity Services to verify an End Customer’s identity, Stripe shares with the Business User the information, documents or photos provided by the End Customer to verify their identity. The Business Users you choose to do business with may further share your Personal Data to third parties they authorize (e.g. other third party service providers).
