Such third party business partner or affiliate may have their own privacy policies, and if Kuna discloses the third parties name to the user, it is your responsibility to read and adhere to such policies. However, if we disclose your Personal Data to a third party business partner or affiliate that you are reasonably unaware of, then Kuna will require that such third party’s privacy policy is at least as strong as Kuna’s; otherwise, users will be provided with a mechanism to opt-out of having their Personal Data viewed by such third parties.</p></div> <div><span>  Law Enforcement; Subpoenas</span><p>  Kuna may disclose Personal Data, including the information or data uploaded to the Service, with or without notice (i) if required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order, (ii) where required by law, or (iii) at our sole discretion, where we deem it necessary to protect the safety of any individual or the general public or to prevent violation of our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy or the rights of Kuna or any third party.</p><span>  Change of Ownership</span></div> <p><p>  In the event of a change in ownership (including through bankruptcy), or a merger, acquisition or sale of assets with or to another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of the Kuna user information, including Personal Data, to such separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on our site or an email to the email address you provide when you register) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of the Kuna Service assets by a third party, and you may choose to modify any of your registration information at that time.</p></p> <div><span>  Email Communications</span><p>  The circumstances under which Kuna may disclose user electronic communications are when: (i) it is necessary in order to provide the Service to the user; (ii) it is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Kuna, its users or third parties’; (iii) it is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants or other legal process that Kuna determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; and/or (iv) it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by Kuna and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime that, in Kuna’s reasonable opinion, has not yet been reported.</p></div> <div><span>  International Transfers</span><p>  Personal Data may be stored and processed in the United States, or in any other country in which Kuna or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using or accessing the Service, you consent to any such transfer of Personal Data outside of your country.</p><span>  Security</span><p>  Kuna uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, such as using SSL security measures, Kuna cannot guarantee complete security. Further, while we take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” or “crackers” from obtaining this information.</p></div> <div><span>  Updating or Removing User Information</span><p>  You may, at any time, choose to correct, update or remove the information you have submitted to Kuna by updating your account on our site.
