Some companies may provide "do not sell" or "do not share" choices and communicate those choices to Microsoft. Microsoft recognizes that the expected result of exercising either of these choices is to exclude third parties from accessing your data for personalized advertising on third-party sites. As a result, we will receive both signals as a valid opt-out triggering this control. Any user who opts out of all personalization also opts out of third-party data sharing.</span></div> <span><span>  This setting is available to signed-in users who set their country to the United States.
