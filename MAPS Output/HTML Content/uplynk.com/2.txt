<div><h1>  Privacy Policy</h1><p>  This Privacy Policy (“<strong> Policy </strong>”) describes what information Edgio and its subsidiaries collects, why we collect it, how we use it, the circumstances under which we disclose it, and how we store and protect it. This Policy also discusses how to contact us with any questions or comments concerning your personal data and the choices that we offer, including how to access and update your personal data. It also describes how we may change this Policy from time to time and provides other important details about privacy- and security-related information.</p></div> <div><h2>  1.   The Information We Collect</h2><p>  Edgio’s services are used by businesses seeking to deliver faster websites, more responsive applications, the highest quality video, and consistent game and software downloads to their customers’ devices. We collect information primarily to provide our services. Some of the information that we collect includes the following:</p><p>  <strong> Contact and registration information </strong>: this typically includes information that allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. If you are using our services, you may provide us additional information necessary for access to our customer portal, such as a user name and password to the portal.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Billing information </strong>: if we provide services to you, in addition to contact information, we also collect information related to your payments for those services, such as your payment and service history.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Network and traffic utilization information </strong>: we collect traffic logs to manage our global network and measure its performance, to investigate, respond to, and resolve service tickets, to analyze data in the aggregate to determine the trends, usage, and usage location of our services, as well as to administer our services generally. Traffic logs include IP addresses, which can identify a specific computer or network device on the Internet, and could, in combination with other data held by third parties, be used to identify individuals. However, Edgio does not identify individuals based on IP address, as identification is not necessary for the provision of our services.</p></p> <div><h2>  2.   How the Information About You Is Collected</h2><p>  We collect information about you in the following ways:</p><ul>  <li><em> Information that you directly provide </em>:</li></ul><p>  You may provide personal information (such as your name, business email address, postal mailing address, business / mobile telephone number) to us in order to use the features and functionality of our services or our website, to request service information, to provide a satisfied customer testimonial or endorsement, to respond to a survey, to participate in case studies, to enter into contests or sweepstakes, or to use Edgio services generally. </p></div> <p><p>  You may also provide to us demographic information, information related to your business website such as the name, description and primary language of the site, company name, telephone number, email address, mailing address, and contacts within your company.</p></p> <p><p>  Our website offers a number of features where you may register for or participate in product and industry conversations and blogs, complete forms for creating a service account, request customer service support, or request a trial. For each of these, you may provide information to us. We collect information about our prospective customers who attend trade shows with us, as well as from individuals who request our digital marketing materials (e.g., white paper downloads) from third parties authorized to distribute such materials on our behalf.</p></p> <p><p>  We provide an area for people looking for a job at Edgio. In applying for a job or asking for information about a job, we, or third parties on our behalf, may require personally identifiable information from you such as your name, address, or email address.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><em> Information that we collect from you indirectly or passively when you interact with us: </em></li></ul><p>  <em> Log Files </em>: When you visit a website, web servers automatically log your interaction with the site in something called a log file. Standard log files like ours contain basic information, such as the URL of the web page you are visiting, your browser type, your ISP, what date and time you requested digital content, and your IP address. The IP address, via geographic lookup, indicates the location of your computer on the Internet. When you consume digital content from our business customers using our network, your interaction with their content is captured in log files in our servers utilized to deliver that content to you. However, Edgio does not, nor can it on its own, link such IP addresses to an individual.</p></div> <p><p>  <em> “Cookies and Other Technologies” Information </em>: When you access our website or use our services, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer. Our cookies may be linked to personally identifiable information. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to help optimize your experience or to protect video content. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site(s). You can use your web browser “Help” feature located in the menu in the upper right corner of your browser to modify your cookie settings. You can also decline to accept cookies when you visit our website.</p></p> <p><p>  Our web pages contain electronic image requests (called a “single–pixel gif” or “web beacon” request) that allow us to count page views and to access cookies. Any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. Web beacons are typically 1–by–1 pixel files, but their presence can usually be seen within a browser by clicking on “View” and then on “Source.” We also include web beacons in HTML–formatted newsletters that we send to opt–in subscribers in order to count how many newsletters have been read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, or share any personally identifiable information about our website visitors. They are just the technique we use to compile anonymous information about website usage.</p></p> <p><p>  Some of our business partners (e.g. analytics providers) use cookies and web beacons on our websites and for our services (collectively referred to as “tracking technologies”). We have no access to or control over these tracking technologies. This Policy covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> “Flash Cookies” Defined </em>: Flash cookies are similar to the cookies described above, and are created when you use your flash-based video player. Flash cookies are stored in your video player’s cache memory. Flash cookies may or may not be removed the same way that cookies are removed. Please review your video player’s “Help,” “Tools” and or “Options” files to learn more about the proper way to modify your Flash cookie settings. Our Flash cookies may be linked to personal information. Some of our business partners (e.g. advertisers) use Flash cookies and other tracking technologies on our site. We have no access to or control over these Flash cookies and other tracking technologies. This Policy covers the use of Flash cookies by us only, and does not cover the use of Flash cookies by any third parties.</p></p> <p><p>  More information about Flash cookies is available on the Adobe <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank"> website </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Other "Automatically Collected" Information:   </em>When you open one of our HTML emails or utilize our Command Line Interface tools, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address, a unique user ID, operating system, version of software installed, system type, screen resolutions, color capabilities, plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, JavaScript enablement, the content and pages that you access on our website or through our services, and the dates and times that you visit, paths taken, time spent on sites and pages, and the commands that you actually run on the Command Line Interface, and the type of website or project that you are using the Command Line Interface tool for</p></p> <div><h2>  3.   How We Use the Information We Collect</h2><p>  We use the information that we collect to generally provide, maintain, enhance, and protect all of our services and features, to allow us to charge and invoice our customers, and to enforce our terms of service.

We do not disclose, release, publish, disseminate, rent, or sell your personal information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses.

If Edgio were to receive such a request, Edgio may disclose Personal Data to the extent required to meet a legal obligation, including national security or law enforcement obligations and applicable law, rule, order, or regulation.
