Through the use of cookies, we may automatically collect information about your online activity on our website, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Our website uses two types of cookies: (1) “session” cookies which are deleted from your computer when you leave the website and are used purely to help you navigate around the website; and (2) “persistent” cookies which remain on your computer so that the website can recognize you when you return. Plug-ins are pieces of software that users download to allow certain web-based software to operate. In order to use our website, you may be required to install certain plug-ins. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, see <a href="privacypolicy#11" target="_blank"> Your Choices </a> below.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3><p>  We may obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect directly from you. For example, we may collect information about you from third parties, including but not limited to identity verification services, credit bureaus, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information, and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.</p></div> <div><h2>  Use of Information</h2><p>  We use the information we collect to deliver the products and services you request and customize your experience with us, to administer your account, and to target advertisements based on users’ interests and to understand how users interact with ads.

We also provide our vendors, consultants, and service providers with our opt-out lists so that communications sent on behalf of Panasonic are not sent to opt-out participants.</p></p> <p><p>  During the past 12 months, we disclosed identifiers such as IP addresses, internet and other electronic network activity information, device information, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, conversion information, and data that may be deemed sensitive, such as precise geolocation information and payment information to our advertising partners, payment processors, platform partners, installers, distributors and resellers. This practice is discussed further below. Panasonic may disclose aggregated statistics about visitors to its website, along with anonymous information collected from other sources. We may also disclose aggregated or de-identified information with third parties (such as advisors, promotional sponsors, and investors), which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for various business purposes, including conducting general business analysis and developing website content and services.</p></p> <div><h2>  Social Sharing Features</h2><p>  The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.</p></div> <div><h2>  Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h2><p>  We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the web and in mobile applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information may be used by Panasonic and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity.

Your device may also include a feature (“Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS or “Opt Out of Interest-Based Ads” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.</p></div> <p><p>  Our Cookie Policy sets out details of the individual cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them. The Cookie Policy can be accessed here: <a href="https://na.panasonic.com/us/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</p></p> <div><h2>  Sales of Personal Information and Targeted Advertising</h2><p>  Panasonic allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow those companies to receive information about your activity on Panasonic that is associated with your browser or device for various purposes, including targeted advertising. The companies may use that data to serve you more relevant ads on our sites or others. Under some state laws, sharing data for online advertising like this is considered to be a “sale” of information.</p></div> <p><p>  You always have full control over whether these technologies work on your devices. You can disable them entirely by clicking the “Do Not Sell My Information” link on our websites.</p></p> <div><h2>  Data Retention</h2><p>  We store the information we collect on you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it, or for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. We may retain records related to:</p><ul>  <li>Invoices and payments for 7 years;</li><li>Job applications and other related documentation for 6 or more years;</li><li>System use for 3 years; and</li><li>Customer profiles, surveys and communications for 5 years.</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries</h2><p>  Panasonic is based in the United States and we process and store information in the U.S. Our websites are intended for users in the United States and its territories and possessions, but if you use the websites from any country outside the United States, the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries, and by visiting the Website, you consent to these transfers as required or permitted by applicable law.
