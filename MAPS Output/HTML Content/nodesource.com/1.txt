<div><h1>   Privacy Policy </h1><span>  Last updated Aug 10 2023</span><p>  <b> INTERACTIVE INSIGHTS PRIVACY POLICY </b></p><p>  <b> Revised: December 1, 2019 </b> </p><p>  Interactive Insights, Inc and its associated business unit Predictive Solutions and wholly owned subsidiaries NodeSource and ContexLink (collectively “Interactive Insights” or “we”, “us”, “our”) is a technology company that enables our clients to reach consumers with greater efficiency and more relevant messages across various digital channels, including online, mobile, email, and addressable TV.</p></div> <p><p>  This privacy statement (“Policy”) explains what kinds of information we collect and how Interactive Insights strives to collect, use and disclose information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which we do business. This Policy applies to our data platform (“Platform”) and our associated services (“Service(s)”) as well as our websites located at http://www.interactiveinsights.io/, https://www.contextlink.io/, http://www.predictive-inc.com/, and https://nodesource.com/ (our “Websites”). </p></p> <div><p>  <b> PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR WEBSITES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS </b></p><p>  <b> Personally Identifiable Information (PII) </b></p><p>  Interactive Insights collects Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) from its Websites when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, or by completing a form on the Websites. Interactive Insights uses this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry</p></div> <div><p>  <b> Non-Personally Identifiable Information </b></p><p>  Interactive Insights also collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) from visitors to the Websites. Non-PII is information that cannot by itself be used to identify a particular person or entity, and may include your IP host address, pages viewed, browser type, Internet browsing and usage habits, Internet Service Provider, domain name, the time/date of your visit to this Website, the referring URL and your computer’s operating system. In some places, such as the European Economic Area, certain Non-PII such as cookie IDs and IP addresses are considered personal data.</p></div> <div><p>  <b> Cookies and other Tracking Technologies </b></p><p>  Interactive Insights and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Websites, and track users’ movements around the Websites. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. For more information about cookies, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/.</p><p>  Our third party partners may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising from those partners, click here. Please note you will continue to receive generic ads.</p></div> <div><p>  <b> Third Party Websites </b></p><p>  The Interactive Insights Websites may contain links to and advertisements for websites operated by third parties whose privacy practices may differ from Interactive Insights’ policies. While the company endeavors to associate only with reputable entities, Interactive Insights cannot guarantee the privacy practices of other websites will reflect ours; we encourage you to check the privacy policies of all websites that you visit.</p><p>  <b> PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR PLATFORM AND SERVICES  </b>
</p></div> <div><p>  <b> Overview of Interactive Insights’ connectivity Services </b></p><p>  The Interactive Insights Connectivity and Context Services include data onboarding, linking, and distribution to companies and many of the players in the digital advertising industry to enable smarter targeting with more relevant messages and more accurate measurement. Onboarding is a service that loads 1st, 2nd and 3rd party data into the digital ecosystem (Customer Data Platform (CDP)), so it can be used for digital advertising purposes. The players include advertisers wishing to reach consumers, advertising supported websites, advertising supported apps, email marketing services, and addressable TV channels.</p></div> <p><p>  Today consumers interact with advertisers and brands through a variety of channels – offline and digital. This cross channel interaction is known as “omni channel.” Interactive Insights services are used to support these interactions for several types of entities in the digital advertising industry, including: Consumer Brands, Companies that enable the delivery of advertising and marketing messages, and Companies that provide consumer data and insights to brands to help them better understand their current and prospective customers. Brands are interested in understanding consumers anywhere: while online, while watching television, while using their mobile devices and virtually everywhere their customers are making purchasing decisions. All that requires lots of data. And Interactive Insights helps brands connect that data in order to help them make intelligent decisions.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> PII and Digital Identifiers uses on the Platform across channels </b></p><p>  Due to technical differences across the channels, Interactive Insights uses different approaches tailored specifically to each channel to provide our Connectivity Services. The common basis of these services is an ID that Interactive Insights assigns to an individual. The ID may be used in a personally identifiable state or in a manner that is not used to identify the individual, depending on the channel and the use.</p></div> <p><p>  ​Interactive Insights collects certain types of information in connection with our Connectivity Services. This includes personal data such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number if permitted by our partners and clients through policy notices they have provided to consumers. We also collect other data such as IP address, mobile device ID, and browser and operating system type and version. In addition, we handle, process, and share this data with our marketing platform partners in the course of performing our services; however we do not retain or use this data for our own internal business purposes unless permitted by our clients.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> Interactive Insights Cookie-based Connectivity Services </b></p><p>  Connectivity Services for cookie-based integrations are based on a Interactive Insights ID and a Interactive Insights cookie that together identify a browser. The cookie containing the ID is set when a consumer clicks on a offer, reward, or survey, visits the website of one of our cookie match partners as a registered user, or when a consumer opens certain emails from a cookie match partner. Because match partners know the consumer, they enable Interactive Insights to recognize the consumer as well and set the Interactive Insights cookie containing the appropriate ID.​</p></div> <p><p>  For example, our match partners may enable us to place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device, and our match partners may share personal data with us, such as your name, postal address, or email address. Interactive Insights uses the personal data to link an ID to information stored in LiveRamp, and add context to the profile. We also may collect information such as the device’s IP address and browser or operating systems type and version. We use this information to recognize consumers and add context across different channels and platforms over time for the purposes of facilitating online advertising, analytics, attribution, fraud detection, and reporting purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  For cookie-based integrations, three types of connections are maintained. The first is the connection between Interactive Insights cookies and marketing platform partner cookies, a sync that enables Interactive Insights to distribute advertising data to partners on behalf of our clients. In this case, the Interactive Insights cookies containing Interactive Insights IDs are synced with cookies set by our marketing platform partners.​</p></p> <p><p>  The second connection is between Interactive Insights cookies and LiveRamp and/or third-party data providers. In this case, LiveRamp and/or third party data providers onboard their data and Interactive Insights matches it to the appropriate Interactive Insights IDs, thereby connecting the data to the correct Interactive Insights cookie.​</p></p> <p><p>  Finally, the third connection is between a brand’s data and the Interactive Insights graph. When marketers onboard their data, Interactive Insights associates the brand’s data with the Interactive Insights ID, thus connecting this data to the LiveRamp cookies.</p></p> <p><p>  Once all these connections are made, a marketer can use them to understand the context and relationship between their customers to run offers, rewards, surveys, ad's or email marketing campaigns perform and deliver ads or offline marketing to specific individuals when they visit a website with ad inventory. For example, we may facilitate the delivery of an ad to an individual in his or her web browser based on a purchase he or she made in a physical retail store, or we may enable a brand to send a personalized marketing email to that individual based on the fact that he or she visited a particular website.​</p></p> <p><p>  Interactive Insights cookies are set with an RLCDN.com name and expire from Interactive Insights’s system after 90 days unless they are renewed or refreshed. Unlike web “tracking” cookies, Interactive Insights cookies do not “track” users’ behavior across websites. Instead, Interactive Insights cookies are used to recognize an individual so that relevant ads and email marketing can be delivered to the intended recipient.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> Interactive Insights Mobile Connectivity Services </b></p><p>  Connectivity Services for mobile ID integrations are similar to cookie integrations except they use the mobile advertising ID assigned to the device instead of a cookie – namely the Apple ID for Advertising (IDFA) and the Android Advertising ID (AAID). We associate the Interactive Insights ID with the mobile ID just like we would associate the cookie. Interactive Insights links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to mobile devices through the Interactive Insights ID.</p></div> <p><p>  Mobile advertising IDs do not expire like cookies. Instead the device gives the user the ability to change the ID at any time, thus breaking the connection between the old ID and the device. Consistent with our online policy, Interactive Insights IDs are used to recognize individuals so relevant ads and offline marketing can be delivered and campaigns can be measured.</p></p> <div><p>  ​<b> Interactive Insights Addressable TV Connectivity Services: </b></p><p>  Connectivity Services for addressable TV integrations are similar to online and mobile services except they use the subscriber ID assigned by the carrier to the set-top box instead of a cookie or a mobile ID. We associate the Interactive Insights ID with the subscriber ID just like we would associate the cookie or mobile ID. Interactive Insights links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to subscriber IDs through the Interactive Insights ID.</p></div> <p><p>  ​Addressable TV subscriber IDs do not expire like cookies. Instead the carrier gives the user the ability to determine if they wish to see targeted advertising on their TV. Consistent with our online and mobile policy, Interactive Insights IDs are used only to recognize individuals so relevant ads can be delivered and campaigns can be measured.</p></p> <div><p>  <b>  Pseudonymization Processes: </b></p><p>  Interactive Insights may recognize an online, mobile or addressable TV user in two ways. First when our match partner shares personal data with us, or second when they share other information with us that is not used to identify individuals. When they share personal data, we can recognize a consumer on an identifiable basis. However, to preserve user privacy, we create a unique Interactive Insights ID when we combine it with other anonymous data.</p></div> <p><p>  Interactive Insights values the preservation of consumer privacy, designing its systems and services to treat personal data and other information that is not used to identify individuals with utmost care. Interactive Insights chooses the appropriate Interactive Insights ID, either personal data or de-identified, based on the services it has been asked to perform; it does not mingle the two in any way that compromises user protections or choice.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES </b></p><p>  <b> Updating and Deleting Your Information  </b></p><p>  Upon request, and as required under applicable law, Interactive Insights will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your data. If you’d like to update, correct, delete, port or deactivate any data that you have provided to the company on the Websites or otherwise via our business operations, please send your request to privacy@interactiveinsights.com, and Interactive Insights will process your request. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe – for data subjects located in the EU, that time frame will be 30 days and Interactive Insights will honor such requests as they pertain to personal data.</p></div> <div><p>  <b> Choice Mechanisms </b></p><p>  Interactive Insights wants to make sure you are informed of the privacy choices that are available to you. We require that our partners meet the same high standards we have. We contractually require that our match partners employ notice and choice mechanisms, and we work with other information service providers and our partners to assist them in following their respective industry standards. While we only process data as directed by our clients with respect to the Platform and Services, we believe the following information may be helpful.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Opt-out from Interest Based Advertising from third-party companies </li></ul><p>  - Many of our partners that enable targeted advertising are members of one or more digital advertising industry self-regulatory programs. You may click below for the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and European Digital Advertising Alliance (“eDAA”) opt-out tools to learn more about targeted or interest-based advertising and to opt out of certain targeting programs.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</li><li>http://www.aboutads.info/choices</li><li>http://youronlinechoices.com</li><li>Mobile Application Choices</li></ul></ul> <p><p>   - Mobile operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) offer opt-out choice mechanisms applicable to mobile applications and these choice mechanisms may be found via your mobile device settings. Generally when advertising companies are able to detect that a user of a device has opted out via their mobile operating system, such companies won’t use your data to target ads on mobile applications for that device.</p></p> <p><p>  Interactive Insights doesn’t generally engage in the types of behaviors that would subject us to choice requirements via our Platform or Services. However, our clients may engage in such behaviors. As a result, we’ve configured our systems to recognize, manage and store signals from choice mechanisms in multiple channels so that our customers may take action (or refrain from taking action) in response to such signals.  </p></p> <div><p>  Privacy Shield</p><p>  Interactive Insights complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.

Interactive Insights shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless Interactive Insights proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p></p> <div><p>
