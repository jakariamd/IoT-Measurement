<strong> Information Your device provides passively about the device, the
			network it is on and the device's location. </strong>

			identifiers (IDs). Some of these IDs are generated by Your device and
			some of these are provided to Your device by Us or our Providers. These
			may be in the form or numbers or combinations of letters, numbers and
			other characters or other codes. These may be used to allow AccuWeather
			and its Providers and others who assist AccuWeather in the support of
			AccuWeather Sites to know Your device's location, web browsing movements
			or information about the environment near the device. When You use
			certain AccuWeather Sites, We allow You to choose when and how often to
			share Your device location data with Us and the purposes for which We or
			our Providers may use Your device location data. Basic AccuWeather app
			features will still function if You choose not to share Your device
			location data to receive personalized content and advertising.
		</p></p> <p><p>  
			When you use AccuWeather Sites, your device may send us some or all of
			the following:
		</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> GPS Coordinates </strong>. The GPS coordinates of a device. On
				many devices, enabling or disabling "Location Services" or a similar
				setting controls whether the device sends GPS coordinates.
			</li><li>
<strong> Internet Protocol (IP) Address </strong>. An IP Address is a
				number automatically assigned by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
				The IP address is the host computer a device uses to connect to the
				ISP's network to send information to Us or to our Providers and for a
				device to receive information back from Us or from our Providers.
			</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Device ID </strong>. A Device ID is a combination of letters
				and numbers that is unique to the device You are using. The Device ID
				identifies the device, regardless of who is using the device. On many
				devices, the Device ID is provided by the device manufacturer and
				stored permanently in the memory of the device. Depending on how the
				manufacturer configured the device, You may not be able to change it.
			</li><li>
<strong> Advertising ID (AAID) or ID for Advertising (IDFA) </strong>.
				These are combinations of letters and numbers that are unique to the
				device You are using. However, these identifiers may not be permanent.
				Depending on Your device, You may be able to reset them through the
				settings of Your device or Your browser.
			</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Information about other devices that are near Your device </strong>. Your device commonly has several types of wireless communications
				methods, and each is enabled or disabled separately by You. If You are
				using a wireless or cellular connection, the device may log and
				transmit when it has come in contact or connected to other devices or
				components of the network the device is using. These include things
				such as:
				</li><li>
						When You enable WiFi, a basic service set identifier (BSSID) of a
						WiFi access point near the device
					</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
						When You enable a cellular connection, a cell tower near the
						device
					</li><li>
						When You enable Bluetooth, a Bluetooth beacon near the device
					
</li><li>
<strong> Information from sensors on Your device </strong>. Many mobile
				devices include sensors that measure information about the
				surroundings of the device. These include things like gyroscopes,
				accelerometers and altimeters that measure things like rotation, speed
				direction and altitude. Some wearable devices also include sensors for
				body conditions like pulse and body temperature.
			</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Information about the performance of Your device </strong>.
				This may include information such as how much battery power the device
				is using, the operating system and version the device is using and the
				version of Our application the device is using.
			</li><li>
<strong> Cookies </strong>. Cookies are files with small amounts of
				data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. If You are
				accessing an AccuWeather Site through a browser, including a browser
				on a mobile device, cookies may be sent to the browser and stored in
				the device's memory. This identifies the device the next time it
				accesses an AccuWeather Site through a browser. You can instruct your
				browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
				sent. However, if You do not permit the device to accept cookies, Your
				experience may not be optimal when You return to an AccuWeather Site
				because We may not recognize the device. You can learn more about how
				we use cookies <a href="/en/cookiepolicy" target="_blank"> 
				here </a>.
			</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Pixel Tags, Web Beacons, Flash Shared Objects/HTML5 Local
					Storage/HTML5 Mini Databases </strong>. Many mobile devices use these technologies which allow for the
				storage of information on the mobile devices and, in effect, allow the
				enhancement of internet browsing The Flash Shared Objects, HTML5 Local
				Storage and HTML5 Mini Databases also allow the device to track a
				user's web browsing movements across the internet and not just on one
				particular website. You can learn more about how we use these
				technologies <a href="/en/cookiepolicy" target="_blank"> here </a>.
			</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
			If you turn off "Location Services" or a similar setting that controls
			GPS functionality, the device still may automatically send or receive
			this other information as long as you have these other communications
			types enabled. You should read the instructions related to Your device,
			operating system or browser to learn about how to control the
			information Your device may transmit.
