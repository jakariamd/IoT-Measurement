If you are located in the State of California, you can also call toll-free using the numbers provided <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/ccpa-contact/" target="_blank"> here </a>. You can also designate another person to submit requests to exercise your data protection rights on your behalf to Qualtrics. </p></div> <div><h4>  How will Qualtrics verify requests to exercise data protection rights?</h4><p>  Qualtrics will take steps to verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty before it will process the data protection right you want to exercise. When feasible, Qualtrics will match Personal Data provided in your request to exercise your rights with information already maintained by Qualtrics. This could include matching two or more data points that are already maintained by Qualtrics.</p><p>  In accordance with the verification process set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), for deletion requests or for requests related to Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, Qualtrics will require a more stringent verification process to minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data. If Qualtrics must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by Qualtrics, Qualtrics will only use it for the purposes of verifying your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.</p></div> <p><p>  Qualtrics will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law.</p></p> <p><p>  If you take the view that Qualtrics is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country where you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state where Qualtrics is incorporated.</p></p> <div><h4>  B.
