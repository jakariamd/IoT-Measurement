<div><h1>  Protecting you means protecting your privacy</h1><p>  Protecting your privacy isn’t just important. It’s mission critical. That’s why we consider it in every product and service we design. As a company that was born to keep you and your loved ones safe, we’re committed to protecting your privacy just as vigilantly as your home.</p></div> <div><h2>  Privacy by design</h2><p>  Privacy protection is embedded in every product and service we create. </p><p>  Here are some of the ways our hardware helps ensure it:</p><ul>  <li>Our indoor cameras are engineered with mechanical privacy shutters that audibly click open and closed. </li><li>LED light indicators let you know when a camera is active or recording.</li><li>Our outdoor cameras purposefully allow you to set motion zones so that you can exclude areas that you don't want in view.</li><li>Our cameras allow you to turn off the microphone and audio so sensitive conversations are for your ears only.</li></ul></div> <span><span>  When it comes to the privacy of your videos, not only are they encrypted, but employees do not have access to them unless to comply with the law or by your specific request.</span></span> <p><p>  Even if you opt in to features that help us keep your home safer during an alarm event, more security should not mean less privacy. </p></p> <p><p>  So, when you activate Video Verification and/or 24/7 live guard protection, monitoring agents:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Can only view Video Verification recordings for up to one hour after an alarm event before their access is automatically terminated.</li><li>Can only view 24/7 live guard protection live camera streams during an alarm event for up to 20 minutes.</li><li>Lose access to recordings and live camera streams if an alarm is canceled.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  You are in control</h2><p>  Fact: collecting and sharing data is a crucial part of the products, services and information that help us protect you. </p><p>  But here’s another fact: it’s your data. So we believe you should control it and have transparency into where and how it’s being used.</p><ul>  <li>When you install and use our cameras, you have the ability to disable machine learning features, such as person detection.</li><li>We will not share your information with law enforcement unless we are required to do so by law.</li><li>You choose to opt in to Video Verification and 24/7 live guard protection services.</li><li>You can delete video recordings from your timeline using our mobile app.</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  A mission that's
single-minded</h2><p>  Protection. It’s why this company was born.</p><p>  While other security companies have become more focused on
commercializing your private information, we have not. And will not. We’re here to make every home secure. To protect you and your privacy.
