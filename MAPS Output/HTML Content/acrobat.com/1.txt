More information is available for our business customers that want to learn more about <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/eudatatransfers.html" target="_blank"> Cross-border data transfers </a></p></p> <div><h3>  What rights do I have regarding my personal information and how can I exercise these rights?</h3><p>  Under the law of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this information to another controller. You may be entitled to additional rights based on applicable data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.</p></div> <p><p>  In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances (such as where we are using the information for direct marketing).</p></p> <p><p>  These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, Adobe websites recognize the Global Privacy Control available in some web browsers. If your browser is configured to send this signal, Adobe will opt you out of Adobe’s use of advertising cookies on that browser. You can learn more about Adobe’s <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing.html" target="_blank"> advertising practices </a> and your privacy choices <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_blank"> here </a>. </p></p> <p><p>  To exercise any of these rights (including deactivating your Adobe ID account), you can get in touch with us – or our data protection officer – using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our Services and Software allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the "<a href="https://accounts.adobe.com/" target="_blank"> my account </a></p></p> <span><span>  ," "my profile," or a similar feature of the service you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our Services and Software by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available.</span></span> <p><p>  If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Ireland's lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p></p> <p><p>  When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or fully functional. For example, to register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID, and to use some Adobe Services and Software, the provision of some information is mandatory: if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you, or provide you with the Services and Software requested. Other optional information, if not provided, may impact our ability to provide a personalized experience or tailored content or offerings.

We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in the future.</p></p> <div><h3>  Can children use Adobe websites and apps?</h3><p>
