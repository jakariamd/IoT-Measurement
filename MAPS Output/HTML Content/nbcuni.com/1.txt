</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  DOES NBCUNIVERSAL “SELL” OR “SHARE” MY PERSONAL INFORMATION & HOW CAN I OPT OUT?</h3><p>  California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information and the sharing of their personal information for cross context behavioral advertising (also known as “targeted advertising”). The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) defines a ‘sale’ in a way that may include allowing a third party to receive certain information to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you. This profiling powers interest-based advertising on some NBCUniversal sites and services and marketing to you and allows us to keep many of our sites and services at low or no cost. </p></div> <div><p>  We disclose the following information to third parties and such disclosure may be considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA and is sharing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes:</p><ul>  <li>identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers [contact information], geolocation information, such as city; and inference data.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We disclose this information in order to enable marketing to you and to deliver targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables NBCUniversal to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.</p></p> <p><p>  To learn how to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising, you can go to <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/notrtoo" target="_blank"> this link </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  CAN I LIMIT THE USE OF MY SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3><p>  We may use certain sensitive personal information as allowable by law for purposes including analytics and to enable marketing to you and the delivery of targeted advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites, such displaying an ad relevant to your precise location data.</p><ul>  <li>You can change your precise geolocation permissions for our mobile apps in your mobile device settings.</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  HOW LONG DOES NBCU RETAIN MY DATA?</h3><p>  We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes of use described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests.  The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes.  If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.  In addition, in the event you have an account that holds credits, point balances or other entitlements, we may continue to hold the account to allow you to obtain the benefit in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.</p></div> <p><p>  We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the NBCUniversal Services you use and how you interact with them. Some NBCUniversal Services may provide additional details on their data retention practices, so we encourage you to consult their website and/or FAQs.</p></p> <div><p>  Follow us on LinkedIn</p><span>  Follow us on Twitter </span><span>  Like us on Facebook </span><span>  instagram</span></div> <div><h2>  Footer menu</h2><span>  New </span></div> <div><h2>  Secondary Footer</h2><p>  © 2023 NBCUNIVERSAL MEDIA, LLC.</p></div>
