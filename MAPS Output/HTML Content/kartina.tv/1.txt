    10. Cookies and Other Technologies
</h3><p>  
    We and our service providers use cookies and other technologies (for example, web beacons) for various reasons. For example, we use cookies and other technologies to facilitate access to our services, recognizing you when you return; to offer and analyze our services; to learn more about our users and their potential interests, as well as to adjust and improve our marketing and advertising campaigns. We want to make sure you know how we use these technologies. This notice explains the technologies we use, their functions and your choices regarding their use.
</p></div> <p><p>  
    When you visit the website, cookies may be set. Cookies are small text files that are stored on the hard disk of your computer and allow you to recognize your repeated visits, but do not allow to define your identity. Cookies are used to offer you an alias-based website and to facilitate your use of the website. Web beacons (or so-called tracking pixels) are used for the same purpose. Web beacons are small graphical elements that can be used on web pages that allow to record and analyze a log file and, thus, can be used for statistical evaluations.
</p></p> <p><p>  
    You can usually prohibit the storage of cookies or set that you must agree to setting cookies. You can control this individually using the settings of your browser. You can also delete the set cookies through your browser settings. Please note that a ban on the use of cookies is technically usually implemented by setting a prohibitive cookie. Thus, another cookie is stored on your computer, which prevents the transmission of relevant information to the website operator.
</p></p> <p><p>  
    Web beacons (also called Clear Gif or tracking pixels) often work with cookies. We and our service providers can use them for the same purposes as cookies, for example, to understand and improve the use of our service, improve the performance of the website, track the number of visitors and the behavior of visitors on our website and understand the interaction with our ads (including email and online advertising on third-party sites). Since web beacons often work with cookies, the rejection of cookies may in many cases limit the effectiveness of web beacons.
</p></p> <p><p>  
    We use other technologies similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB and WebSQL). Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. We may use these and other technologies for cookie-like purposes, for example, to ensure compliance with our Terms of Service, prevent fraud and analyze the use of our service. There are several ways to influence these technologies. For example, many popular browsers offer the ability to clear browser memory. This feature is usually found in the settings. For additional details please visit the help center of your browser. Other technologies, e.g. Silverlight memory may be deleted in the application.
