workspace that relates to your employer if that employer is a Doist
customer), we are a data processor under the applicable privacy laws,
and that organization is the data controller. In those circumstances,
your organization's privacy policy applies, and you should refer to its
privacy policy for information about its privacy practices. For clarity,
we are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.
Please be aware that this Policy does not apply to your activities or
