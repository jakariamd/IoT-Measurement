</h3><p>  Both plans offer all-in-one online protection in a single, simple solution that protects your family’s personal data and privacy.

</h3><p>  Setting up family protection is simple. Just enter an email address or mobile phone number for each person you want to invite. 

Your family member will get a message to log in along with steps to set up protection for their computers, phones, web browsing, and passwords. They’ll also have their own identity monitoring to receive alerts when their personal data is found on the dark web. 

Two adults can also set up credit monitoring, find their personal info on data broker sites to remove it, and clean up personal info from old online accounts.  

Each family member will have their own notifications and log in where they can check their Protection Score along with recommended steps to improve their score and overall online safety.

Consumer reporting agencies are required to investigate and respond to your dispute, but are not obligated to change or remove accurate information that is reported in compliance with applicable law. While this plan can provide you assistance in filing a dispute, the FCRA allows you to file a dispute for free with a consumer reporting agency without the assistance of a third party.
