As regards your payment information, note that we only store the last four digits of your payment card number and the expiration year/month.</p></div> <div><h3>  Refer-a-friend</h3><p>  When you refer a friend to our site (subject to our <a href="/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank"> Terms and Conditions </a>, and, as the case may be, the terms described in the dashboard related to the referral program in the user menu of your account), we do not collect any of their personal data before they become a Member on our site.</p><p>  When your friend clicks on the referral link you shared, we generate a referral number, which we will keep. This standalone information is not qualified as identifiable information. If the referred friend decides to join the site, only then will the referral number lead to their identification.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Personal data from site use </li></ul><p>  We collect and process certain information about you when you are using our services and our site.</p><p>  This means that, when you visit our site or use our services, even if you have not created an account or logged in, we collect certain information, including:</p></div> <div><h5>  Usage information</h5><ul>  <li>your activity history on our site and the special features you used on the site (e.g. sent a feedback after private chat, rated a Model, “favorited” a Model, made a video/voice call with a Model, etc...)</li><li>the time spent in private chat, who are the Models and categories of Models (for example, by preferences based on ethnicity) you watched;</li><li>username of the Model</li><li>time and date of your communications</li><li>method of communication (e.g., wall message, private chat, etc...)</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Moreover, if you participate in our loyalty program, referred as the Club Elite program in our Terms and Conditions, we know what your mask ranking is (i.e., the information you also see in your profile when you are connected to the site). In this respect, please note that we never keep the history of your mask ranking.</p></p> <div><h5>  Content information</h5><p>  For technical purposes and to defend against complaints and legal claims, we store on our system content you create, post and/or transmit via our site (e.g., pictures) and information about the content you create or provide.</p><p>  We also collect, any information you communicate to and/or share with Models on the site, such as the messages you send in private chat or during live shows.</p><p>  In case you turn on your camera or microphone in private chat, we never record or keep in any way your camera feed or audio. We also do not allow Models to record or capture your camera or audio feeds during private shows. Such action is prohibited on our site.</p></div> <p><p>  If you use the Video/Voice Call feature on our site (to call the Model when she is offline), we do not record or process your communication data with the Model. Your communication is private. Please be advised that we are not responsible for your experience or the content of these private calls.</p></p> <p><p>  We collect any other communication data such as telephone conversations, chat logs, text messages, faxes and letters you send to us.</p></p> <div><h5>  Log data and device information</h5><ul>  <li>IP address</li><li>date and time you logged into your account</li><li>pages viewed</li><li>Features used</li><li>the hardware, software or internet browser used</li><li>operating system / application version used</li><li>language settings</li><li>identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser</li><li>data that identifies your mobile device</li><li>device-specific settings and characteristics</li><li>location details</li><li>app crashes and other system activity</li></ul></div> <div><h5>  Cookies / Other Technologies</h5><p>  Like many websites and applications, we use cookies and other technologies (e.g., web beacons, web storage) to collect information about your device and your activity, for example your browser type and browser information, your computer’s operating system, your IP address, the pages you viewed or the features you used.</p><p>  For cookies which are not considered as necessary for the use of this website, we ask your explicit consent before placing these on your device (i.e. the banner that was displayed on your device when you entered our website for the first time). Keep in mind, though, that blocking cookies may negatively affect your experience on our site.</p></div> <p><p>  To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices, please check our <a href="/cookies-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a></p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Personal data collected by third parties</li></ul><p>  Models: when discussing with our Billing Support and Customer Support teams, a Model may provide some information about you, which will be collected.</p><p>  External Partners’ Ad Networks: they help us to promote our site. They may collect information about your interactions with our ads on our behalf.</p><p>  Internal Partner Ad Network: we manage an ad network and promotional tools ourselves. Third parties affiliated partners may contact us with information about your interactions with our ads and promotional tools published/used on their sites or affiliated sites (i.e. sites with partial or full reproduction of our primary site).</p></div> <p><p>  Refer-a-Friend: If you joined us by referral link, please note that we did not hold any of your personal data before you chose to join or visit the site, as the case may be. By clicking on the referral link, a random referral number was generated which could not identify you until you chose to sign up to our platform. The referral number is merely a way to determine if you and your “friend” are eligible to receive a fee reward/credit.</p></p> <p><p>  Some states or countries legally require that we verify your age at the time of creation of your account. We may then rely on such information provided by a third party ("Age Verification Provider"). Whenever possible, we request the Age Verification Provider to only share with us a binary value (e.g. over 18 / under 18), in order to minimize the amount of personal data we process.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Public Personal Data</li></ul><p>  We collect publicly available information about you only when it is necessary to prevent fraud and illegal activities on our site (e.g., when we suspect that you are using a false or stolen credit card, when we witness child abuse cases, or pedophile activity, etc.).</p><p>  This data may comprise publicly available information you share on social media like Facebook, your blog and/or site, and any other public data available on the internet.</p><p>  This information is always associated or combined with the data we collect through our site to finalize our investigation before reporting any fraud and illegal activities to authorities. We never use publicly available data for any other purpose.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Special category of data</li></ul><p>  This means data of a sensitive nature, the exposure of which would significantly impact your fundamental rights and freedoms; for example, it could be used against you for unlawful discrimination (e.g., your sexual interests/preferences).</p><ul>  <li>Site Personalization: If you consent to the use of cookies or specifically to personalization of content via the “gravity_ cookie”, as named in your browser (see section <a href="#personalize-content" target="_blank"> 3.7 below </a>). Please be aware that you can revoke your consent for this cookie as explained in our <a href="/cookies-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>. If you do so, the site will no longer be personalized to your tastes and therefore your user experience will be different.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Paid services: When you use our site and purchase services (e.g., live cam shows, private chat, buy a Model surprises, etc.), we process and store information related to your activity (e.g., the Model category or the Models whose services you subscribed for, etc.) in order to provide you with the services you requested.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Due to the explicit meaning of each category name, as well as the types of Models you request services from, it is possible, although not certain, that the chosen categories indicate your sexual preferences.</p></p> <p><p>  You may revoke your consent regarding this processing in your consent settings at any time. However, please note that such revocation means that you will not be able to log into your account and use the services, as we will not be able to provide you with the services without processing such information.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Profile Updating: This refers to the aspects of your profile, which are optional, such as indicating your age, gender or sexual preferences (see clause 2.1, “Profile Information”). In case that you freely indicated your sexual preferences, you can easily remove this from your account profile without affecting the use of the site.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We understand that the information we have about you may not explicitly reflect the reality of your life outside of the site. Your online preferences may only be a role that you choose to play in a virtual environment. In order to provide you with the utmost level of data protection, we categorize such type of data as sensitive, which is highly protected and handled with the utmost care.</p></p> <p><p>  Because your online sexual preferences and other data relating to your sexual interests are essential aspects of privacy, we are maintaining very high technology security standards. We are regularly proceeding with controls and assessments of our security measures, to guarantee a trustworthy environment.</p></p> <div><h1>  Why do We Process Your Personal Data?</h1><p>  We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p><ul>  <li>Account Activation</li><li>Basic information: We primarily use the personal data you give us when creating your online account to open and administer this account.

We place great emphasis on the improvement of our services and the enhancement of your experience as a Member or Guest.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  To better understand your needs and how we can improve our services, we compile the information you gave to us or that we collected about you when visiting pages on our site or while using our services, to detect general trends regarding the preferences/habits of our users. This helps us, for example, to generate statistics reports on our customers’ activity based on the categories of Models viewed, the countries, or the purchases. The information in these reports is in aggregate form, and cannot be used to identify individuals.</p></p> <p><p>  We are also using the services of <a href="https://www.hotjar.com" target="_blank"> Hotjar </a> and other third party service providers to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices, such as a device's IP address (captured and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and preferred language used to display our website.

Please see section 5 <a href="#data-sharing" target="_blank"> "With Whom do We Share Your Data ?" </a> to learn more.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We also use limited information to tailor our services for you. For example, when you visit and log in on our site we use your IP address to determine the country where you are from, and display our webpages in your language (within the limits of the languages available on the site), so if you visit or login on our site from the United States, our site will automatically display content in English.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><u> Promotion </u>: We have affiliate programs through which webmasters or other third parties can help us to promote our sites.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We share limited information about you with the webmasters or other third parties participating in these affiliate programs, to help them to set up, maintain and optimize their marketing campaigns or promotional activities. This also allows them to track their income.

In the event a referral program is deactivated for whatever reason subject to our Terms and Conditions, any data retained to administer such program will be promptly erased from our system.</p></p> <p><p>  To evaluate the success of our marketing initiatives, we may pseudonymize your email address and use it to generate statistical results. These would be in the form of aggregated data, not personal data (e.g., the number of users per country who receive marketing communications).</p></p> <p><p>  Your email will be further used to send survey participation requests, so that we can learn more about your experience and satisfaction or suggestions for improvements to our service.</p></p> <p><p>  We have a legitimate interest in keeping you informed and in the outcome of our marketing campaigns. You can, of course, unsubscribe from receiving our marketing and informative emails at any time, using a link contained within the emails themselves.

Your choices are:</li><li>Keeping the mask private</li><li>Sharing it only with Models with whom you have chatted privately or</li><li>Making it public for all site’s users.</li><li><u> Last action(s) taken </u>: We will share with the Models you showed interest to, your username along with a history of the last actions you initiated with them (e.g. when you “Like” or comment Model’s “My Content” or when you list a Model in your favorites), including your detailed credit spending history in relation with the said Model (how frequently, when, how much and through what features you have spent credits on the said Model). This limited information will be displayed to the Models in order to allow them to know you better and provide a service tailored to your needs.</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li><u> Additional Profile Information </u></li></ul><p>  You can choose to share other information about yourself with the Model which you added to your profile (e.g., gender, age, location, interests, etc.). You may also connect your camera in private chat to visually communicate with the Model or simply turn on your microphone.

They will also be able to see if you become “King of the Room” and the number of credits you spent on “surprises” to gain the title.</p></div> <p><p>  This information is not personal data, as the other users will not be able to identify you from this information. We therefore would remind you not to use a username that contains any personal information (e.g., your real name) or anything that would allow another user to identify you (e.g., your twitter handle).</p></p> <p><p>  In the event you choose a username which will lead to your identification, please note that you are fully responsible for this action and we cannot be held responsible for any identification made by another user.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Comments</li></ul><p>  If you post comments on a Model’s wall, other users will see them.</p><p>  Your comments and username may also be visible in a search engine (e.g., Google). Therefore, if you do not want other users or the public in general to see your comments, do not post them on a Model’s Wall.</p><ul>  <li>Loyalty Program</li></ul><p>  If you participate in our loyalty program, other users will be able to see your mask ranking, which will appear next to your username when you write a message to the Model in free chat.</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that these two data elements (username & mask) are not considered as personal data, and cannot lead to your identification. However, you can still change your preferences in your privacy settings regarding sharing your mask with other users (e.g., you can keep your mask private).</p></p> <p><p>  Please be assured that any other users of our site will not be able to access any information about you from the moment you enter into private chat.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Entities of our company’s group</li><li>Jasmin IP S.à r.l., 44, Avenue John F.

Only in exceptional circumstances, when we face complex or a high number of requests, we may extend this period of response up to 60 days.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that rights may be exercised free of charge. However, unfounded or excessive requests, in particular because of their repetitive character, will lead to the payment of a fee.</p></p> <p><p>  Please also understand that, because your privacy is so important for us, our Support Team may need to duly verify your identity and ask you to provide additional information before executing your request.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Data access and data portability</li></ul><p>  You have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you by requesting a copy of your personal data, free of charge, through the “Data Download” section in your account settings.</p><p>  Upon verification of your identity, your request will be sent to our Support Team.</p><p>  If we consider that your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive (e.g., due to multiple requests in a short period), we may refuse to act or charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs for providing you with the information.</p></div> <p><p>  In certain cases, you are also entitled to request copies of personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).

Please note this right is subject to certain exceptions, including without limitation our retaining information as necessary to protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, to comply with our legal obligations, and for other internal purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  To exercise these rights contact us as provided in section 9 “<a href="#contacts" target="_blank"> How to Contact Us? </a>” below. You can also exercise your right to deletion by selecting “Forget my Data” in the “Privacy Settings” section of your account settings. Please note that any requested disclosures in connection with a request to know will only apply to the 12-month period preceding the request, and you are entitled to request disclosure twice in any 12-month period.

Please note, however, that the exercise of some of your rights (e.g., to delete your data) may render it impossible for us to continue to deliver services to you.</p><ul>  <li>Your Right to Use an Authorized Agent</li></ul></div> <p><p>  You have the right to designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us as provided in section 9 “<a href="#contacts" target="_blank"> How to Contact Us? </a>” below. In order to verify you have authorized an agent we may require a signed, written authorization from you.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Do Not Track</li></ul><p>  Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Because these features are not yet uniform, we do not presently respond to “do not track” signals.
