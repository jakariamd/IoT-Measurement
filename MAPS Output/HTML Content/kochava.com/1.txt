Civ. Code §1798.120(a) </em></li><li><strong> Right to Deletion: </strong>Consumers have the right to request that a business delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer. Furthermore, the business must direct its service providers to delete the consumer’s personal information. <em> Cal. Civ.

Civ. Code §§1798.100(d) and 1798.130(a)(2) </em></li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Does Kochava share the PII it receives from website visitors with third-parties? </strong>
No, unless Kochava is unable to meet a visitor’s particular business objective. Under such circumstances, Kochava may elect to disclose a visitor’s PII in order to match them with a registered Kochava partner. These partners are contractually obligated to treat the PII with at least the same level of confidentiality as does Kochava. Despite taking these precautionary measures, Kochava may be liable in some circumstances for the onward transfer of personal information to a third party that violates the Privacy Shield Principles.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> How may a website visitor opt-out from receiving communications from Kochava? </strong>
A user may opt-out from receiving communications from Kochava by contacting Kochava via email (<a href="mailto:privacy@kochava.com" target="_blank"> privacy@kochava.com </a>) or by contacting the legal department via telephone (855-862-4282).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Is a website visitor able to limit the use or disclosure of its PII? </strong>
Yes. A visitor may instruct Kochava to limit the use of its data and PII to that which is strictly necessary for Kochava to directly service the visitor. A visitor may also instruct Kochava to limit the use of its data and PII to the express reason Kochava provided for such use. A visitor may also instruct Kochava to permanently delete its PII in the event the visitor no longer desires any communication from Kochava. Furthermore, a visitor may instruct Kochava to withhold disclosure of its PII to third-parties. A visitor may request the above limitations by contacting Kochava via email (<a href="mailto:privacy@kochava.com" target="_blank"> privacy@kochava.com </a>) or by contacting the legal department via telephone (855-862-4282).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Is a website visitor able to access its PII? </strong>
Yes. A visitor may request access to all of its Kochava-collected PII by contacting Kochava via email (<a href="mailto:privacy@kochava.com" target="_blank"> privacy@kochava.com </a>) or by contacting the legal department via telephone (855-862-4282).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Does Kochava process PII on behalf of its commercial clients? </strong>
It depends on how PII is characterized under the terms of the contractual relationship between Kochava and the client. Some jurisdictions define PII more broadly than others to include things like device ID or IP address. Other jurisdictions define PII more narrowly to only include things like email address or first/last name. Kochava almost always processes device ID and IP address, while Kochava almost never processes email address or first/last name. By default, Kochava’s software is programmed to not collect the most obvious types of PII (e.g. email, first/last name). Kochava’s standard license contract requires clients to obtain consent and post privacy policies in order to use Kochava’s services. Furthermore, app stores like iTunes and Google Play have safeguards in place to ensure app developers have proper consent mechanisms and privacy policies in place if the app is programmed to collect certain types of PII.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> How should a website visitor lodge a privacy complaint against Kochava? </strong>
A user should contact Kochava with its privacy complaint via email (<a href="mailto:privacy@kochava.com" target="_blank"> privacy@kochava.com </a>) or by contacting the legal department via telephone (855-862-4282).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Is an independent dispute resolution mechanism in place to resolve privacy complaints brought by citizens of an EU member nation? </strong>
Yes. In the event a citizen of an EU member nation or Switzerland seeks to have an unresolved privacy complaint against Kochava addressed by an independent third-party, the website visitor may contact JAMS. For more information or to file a complaint, a user is encouraged to visit the JAMS website: <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank"> https://www.jamsadr.com/ </a>. Furthermore, if a user privacy complaint is not resolved through these means, a binding arbitration option may be available before the Privacy Shield Panel in certain limited circumstances.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Must Kochava disclose PII in response to lawful requests by public authorities? </strong>
Yes, in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Kochava may be required under certain circumstances to disclose PII in response to lawful requests by public authorities.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Is Kochava subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)? </strong>
Yes. Kochava voluntarily subjects itself to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC, as required by its participation in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Where does Kochava store its collected information? </strong>
Kochava distributes and stores all of the information it collects in secure servers located in the United States. As such, all PII provided by a website visitor to Kochava is hosted on servers located in the United States.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> To whom should a user direct its questions regarding this Privacy Policy? </strong>
