The SentinelOne Agent enables this protection by deploying agents to locations across customer environments, monitoring those locations, and then sending the relevant information to the Singularity XDR Management Console where customers can visualize, detect, and respond directly to events. And for devices on the move, Singularity Mobile provides AI-powered full-device protection to all three major mobile platforms, sending information to the same SentinelOne Management Console. Our agents and mobile solution help identify not just malicious activity but also associated events in order to provide customers with the complete Storyline picture of a suspected or actual compromise. And because hackers are constantly evolving their tactics, techniques, and procedures, SentinelOne monitors vast amounts of machine metadata to help ensure malicious activity is not only caught but is also contextualized and traceable. The overwhelming majority of this metadata is machine generated and contains non-attributable data such as process ID, operating system version, information about applications, and command line arguments. In limited situations however, file names, and generalized location inferred from public IP addresses of the endpoint where the metadata is located are collected. This personal information is almost exclusively considered Customer Data and is collected on behalf of customers in accordance with the directions provided to us in the <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/legal/data-protection-addendum/" target="_blank"> Data Protection Addendum </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  In addition to Customer Data, we also collect and process System Data to provide the Solutions. System Data is information that we collect or generate during the provision and administration of the Solutions and related technical support. System Data consists of:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Technical and Operational Data. </strong> This is information about the Solutions you are using and about the systems and related environment from which you access the Solutions. Examples include agent type and version, license information, UUID, and third-party systems used in connection with the product.</li><li><strong> Console Data. </strong> This is information about your usage of the Management Console. Examples include configuration settings, dashboards, user roles, authentication credentials, and other administrative settings.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Feature Usage Data. </strong> This is information about how the Solutions are used. Examples include details about which features are used and user interface metrics.</li><li><strong> Threat Data. </strong> This is information about threats and potential threats identified on endpoints. Examples include malware, URLs, processes or techniques, metadata, or other data that is potentially related to unauthorized third parties.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  System Data is processed to deliver the Solutions that you and our other customers request. We use System Data to help us improve the performance and functionality of the Solutions, including Threat Data specifically which is used in our proprietary machine learning engines to detect and protect endpoints autonomously from malicious activity. Any limited personal information contained within System Data is never incorporated into the Solutions, nor is it used to contact or market products or services.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Security </strong></p><p>  SentinelOne maintains (and requires its service providers to maintain) appropriate organizational and technical measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the processing, and the threats posed. We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal information secure, however no security procedures or protocols are ever guaranteed to be 100% secure, and as such we do not guarantee the security of any personal information you provide to us or third parties.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> International Transfer of Information Collected </strong></p><p>  SentinelOne is a U.S.-based company which operates globally.
