You consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries.</p></p> <div><p>  The GDPR provides different tools to frame data transfers from the EU to a third country:</p><ul>  <li>sometimes, a third country may be declared as offering an adequate level of protection through a European Commission decision (‘Adequacy Decision’), meaning that data can be transferred with another company in that third country without the data exporter being required to provide further safeguards or being subject to additional conditions. In other words, the transfers to an ‘adequate’ third country will be comparable to a transmission of data within the EU.</li><li>in the absence of an Adequacy Decision, a transfer can take place through the provision of appropriate safeguards and on condition that enforceable rights and effective legal remedies are available for individuals. Such appropriate safeguards include:</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>in the case of a group of undertakings, or groups of companies engaged in a joint economic activity, companies can transfer personal data based on so-called binding corporate rules;</li><li>contractual arrangements with the recipient of the personal data, using, for example, the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission;</li><li>adherence to a code of conduct or certification mechanism together with obtaining binding and enforceable commitments from the recipient to apply the appropriate safeguards to protect the transferred data.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>finally, if a transfer of personal data is envisaged to a third country that isn’t the subject of an Adequacy Decision and if appropriate safeguards are absent, a transfer can be made based on a number of derogations for specific situations for example, where an individual has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer after having been provided with all necessary information about the risks associated with the transfer.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> Marketing </strong></p><p>  We would like to send you information about products and services of ours that we think you might like, as well as those of our partner companies.</p><p>  If you have agreed to receive marketing, you may always opt out later by unsubscribing from the link in any email communications.</p><p>  <strong> What are your data protection rights? </strong></p><p>  We would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights.
