We created this policy to let you know about the information we collect and process about awesome people like you that use our sustainable micro-mobility services, visit our websites, use our mobile apps, buy our products, or otherwise interact with us. It applies to you regardless of where you live, but if you live in certain countries or regions where additional or other terms may apply, see the Global Privacy – Supplemental Terms section of this policy.</p></div> <p><p>  When you read this policy (and we hope that you will), you will learn about the kinds of information we collect about you, how we use that information, when we might disclose your information to others, and your rights and choices regarding this information.</p></p> <p><p>  Before we get onto the good stuff, just keep in mind that when you read this policy that by “Bird,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” we mean Bird Rides, Inc. and our related companies that we own or control including but not limited to Scoot Rides, Inc. and the Circ companies.</p></p> <p><p>  Also note that Bird may create de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized data from your information so that it is reasonably non-identifiable to you. Where we transform data in this way, it is not within the scope of this policy.</p></p> <p><p>  This policy does not apply to independent third parties that may collect or control your information separately from Bird like our business partners and retail sellers of our vehicles. Please be aware that companies not part of the Bird family of companies are separate legal entities from Bird and have their own privacy policies and practices. While we encourage you to review those third-party policies, please understand that Bird is not responsible for those companies’ privacy policies and related legal obligations.</p></p> <p><p>  Except where noted in the Global Privacy – Supplemental Terms, Bird Rides, Inc, 8605 Santa Monica Blvd., #20388, West Hollywood, CA 90069, USA is the responsible entity (or data controller) for your information.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have any questions about this policy, please let us know by writing to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bird.co" target="_blank"> privacy@bird.co </a></p></p> <div><h2>  What Information Do We Collect?</h2><p>  Information You Provide to Us</p><ul>  <li><strong> Contact Information. </strong> Before you take a ride on a Bird rental vehicle, participate in our surveys, contests, sweepstakes, and promotions, subscribe to our marketing updates, use our customer service, register for, or attend, an event, or when you register a Bird vehicle you purchased directly from us, you will be asked to provide certain basic personal contact information such as first name, last name, email address, and a mailing or postal address, phone number, and account information such as login and password. This information may also be provided to us by another person who organizes a group ride that includes you.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Government-Issued Identification. </strong> In many places where we offer vehicles for rent, rules require riders to be of a certain minimum age.

We may use self-taken photographs or videos to determine if you meet any applicable minimum age requirement and we share it only with third parties as necessary to confirm the foregoing. We may also use biometric information, such as photographs, videos, or body mass to confirm that only one rider is utilizing our service. For more information, please see our <a href="https://www.bird.co/biometric/" target="_blank"> Biometric Data Collection and Retention Policy </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Demographic Data. </strong> We also collect certain demographic data if you provide it to us including age, gender, preferred language, and current location.

Our “family of companies” includes companies related to us by common control or ownership. We disclose information within our corporate family as a normal part of business operations and to provide products and services.</p><p>  Public Partners and Transportation Authorities</p><p>  Because our services are sometimes offered through cities or other political/executive subdivisions or require government or administrative permission to operate in certain locations, our business partners may include governmental authorities, local (regional, provincial, city-level) administrations, local quasi-government entities like a city transit authority, and local public transport operators and appointed data aggregators (each a “public partner”).</p></div> <p><p>  We will disclose your information with public partners as may be required to operate in a particular city or location. Public partners may use this information to help improve, inform, or manage city planning activities, public transportation services, traffic congestion, or our vehicles or services (for example, for designating vehicle parking zones, issuing parking fines, or creating restricted areas where our vehicles may not go, like sidewalks) among other public interest purposes the public partner may determine. In some cases, sharing your information with our public partners may be required by law or regulation.</p></p> <p><p>  For some of these purposes, cities have adopted a standard data set called “Mobility Data Specification” (MDS), MDS standardizes communication and data-sharing between cities and private mobility providers, such as Bird. Bird may provide MDS data to public partners where we provide services. For more information about MDS please visit <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/" target="_blank"> https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/ </a></p></p> <div><p>  Other Third Parties</p><ul>  <li><strong> Service Providers. </strong> We use a variety of third-party service providers to help us run our business and perform functions on our behalf, such as professional services (like law firms, consultants, accountants, and tax advisors), hosting, billing and payment processing, delivering push notifications, providing customer service, helping us prevent fraud, securing our systems, delivering app features, etc. For example, we disclose your information with companies we’ve hired to provide customer support or assist Bird in protecting and securing our systems where access to your information is necessary to provide those services. And we could not provide our services without third parties that maintain, service, and manage our fleets of vehicles in all of the cities where we operate. In these cases, we require the third-party service provider to use adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information they receive and to use your information only for the purposes for which they have been granted access.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Business Partners.  </strong>We disclose personal information with other companies that, among others, help us provide services to our customers, or reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:
</li><li><strong> Platform Operators: </strong> If you use our services through a third-party platform that manages its own fleet of Bird vehicles, we will also disclose your information with the platform operator to assist in operating the services.</li><li><strong> Google ARCore: </strong> To help Bird locate vehicles at the end of a ride, an app uses Google Play Services for AR (“ARCore”) provided by Google. The use of ARCore within the app is governed by the Google Privacy Policy. At the end of a ride, you will be asked to use the Bird app and your personal device’s camera to record images of the place where you are leaving the vehicle. The image, your device’s estimated geolocation, and orientation, IP address, and other device information will be collected and processed by ARCore to identify the area where you left the vehicle. Google analyzes this data and returns to Bird information indicating the location of the vehicle.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Advertising and Digital Analytics Companies. </strong> Please see the <em> Cookie Notice </em> for a description of how we work with ad exchanges, channel partners, measurement services, and advertising and digital analytics providers like Facebook, Google, and other third-party ad companies.</li><li><strong> Joint Marketing Partners. </strong> We disclose information with partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.</li><li><strong> Universities and Research Organizations. </strong> We collaborate with universities and researchers around the world to better understand important questions about micro-mobility services like how people use them, how they can be improved, and how they impact the climate. To help with this research, we may disclose your information with our research partners with your consent.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Law Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulatory Agencies, and Others</p></p> <p><p>  When we believe it is necessary, we will disclose personal information to:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies</li><li>In the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of our personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, mobile apps, or the public</li><li>Detect, investigate, or prevent fraud or privacy issues</li><li>Detect, investigate, prevent, stop, or remediate security incidents involving our computer systems or networks</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Protect our rights or property, and those of our subsidiaries and affiliates, or others, including by enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  Blogs and Social Media</p><p>  When you interact with us or post content about us on social media platforms – like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, LinkedIn, YouTube, or Pinterest – any information that you submit through such features is not confidential and may be accessed by others. For example, if you submit a product review on one of our sites, we may display your review (along with the name provided, if any) on other Bird sites and on third-party websites.

If you’d like to request the removal of information that we have posted about you, please contact us.</p></div> <div><p>  Parties to Corporate Transactions</p><p>  We may transfer personal information as part of a corporate transaction like a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of our business or assets. If a transfer for these reasons is subject to legal restrictions, we will comply with the law.</p></div> <div><h2>  <strong> Cookie Notice </strong></h2><p>  What is a “Cookie?”</p><p>  Almost every website uses cookie technology. We are no exception. Bird uses cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, social media plugins, and other similar technologies (some of which are operated by third parties) on our websites and other digital platforms to collect data (“Cookies”).</p><p>  Cookies are small files that store Internet settings. A Cookie consists of a string of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your device and collects information about your use of our website, and in some cases, other websites.</p></div> <div><p>  How does Cookie technology work?</p><p>  The first time you visit a website, your device’s Internet browser will download the Cookies placed on the site and store them in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.) The Cookie will collect information about your visit – things like what pages you visited, how the site performed, what ads you clicked, how you were brought to the site, account sign-on, or your preferences and settings – depending on the type of Cookie.</p><p>  The next time you visit the same website with the same device, the Cookie, and the information stored in it, are sent back to the website (a first-party Cookie) or sent to another website if the Cookie is operated by a third party (a third-party Cookie). This exchange of information allows the website to know you’ve been there before and perhaps display more relevant information.</p></div> <p><p>  We use Cookie data to help us understand things like how many site visitors we had, how fast the pages loaded, or whether we had any performance issues, to record your preferences, personalize content and ads, and track information about the performance of our advertisements, among other purposes. We may combine this information with other information we collect from you.</p></p> <div><p>  What types of Cookies do you use?</p><p>  Different Cookies serve different purposes. Based on the Cookie’s function and purpose, we divide them into five categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, Advertising, and Pixels and Beacon. For more information about specific Cookies, including the identity of any third parties that receive Cookie data and the Cookie expiration dates, and to make choices regarding Cookies that are not strictly necessary, click on “Cookie Preferences” in the cookie banner on the webpage.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Strictly Necessary. Cookies that are “strictly necessary” ensure the performance of a website. Without strictly necessary Cookies, you would not be able to use this website as intended. For example, when you open a web page, you are shown a version that corresponds to the bandwidth of the Internet connection you are using, or when traffic is high, we can switch to another server. Because these Cookies are required for the website to operate, you may not opt-out or deactivate strictly necessary cookies.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Performance and Analytics. As the name suggests, performance Cookies collect information on how a website is used and how it performs. They tell us how many visitors we have, how they were referred to our site, how they move about on our site, whether visitors encounter error messages, how fast pages load, and measure the performance of our advertising, etc. This information helps us measure and improve the performance of our site. Performance Cookies do not save any information that permits the identification of the user and are only used to understand and improve the functionality of our websites. One of the performance Cookies we use is Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). To learn more about Google’s analytics services and to learn how to opt-out of tracking of analytics by Google visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank"> https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Functional. </strong> These types of Cookies enhance a website’s performance and functionality like saving details that have already been provided (e.g. user name, language choices, or your location so you don’t have to enter the information later) or enabling the playback of videos. Because functional Cookies collect anonymized information, they cannot track your movement on other websites.</li><li>Advertising. These Cookies may be set on our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant ads on other sites. They are based on uniquely identifying your browser and device. When your browser connects to a third-party advertising partner’s web server, the advertising partner is able to read (or set) its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. This information is used to show you ads across the Internet that are tailored to your interests. If you do not allow these Cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Pixels and Beacons. Pixel tags (a/k/a web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies described above. You will find invisible pixel tags embedded on web pages or within emails. We, or our service providers, may use pixel tags, among other things, to track the activities of users of our websites or mobile apps, help manage content, measure ad performance and compile statistics about usage. We or our service providers also use pixel tags in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  How can I control or delete Cookies?</p><p>  You have the right to choose whether to accept Cookies. Please note that if you choose to refuse Cookies you may not be able to use the full functionality of the website. Here are some ways to manage Cookies:</p><p>  <strong> Web Browsers </strong></p><ul>  <li>Change your Cookie settings for at any time using the Cookie consent tool on the website.</li><li>Control Cookies by using the Cookie settings on your browser. Note that if you use your browser settings to block all Cookies (including strictly necessary Cookies) you may not be able to use or access our site.</li><li>Some browsers have incorporated features referred to as “Do Not Track” (DNT). DNT tells the websites you visit that you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals, however, you can still control Cookies by using the other options available to you as described in this section of the Cookie Notice.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>If you accept some or all Cookies on the website you still have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a Cookie, so that you may determine whether to accept it or not.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  Mobile Devices</p><ul>  <li>Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that Cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.</li></ul><p>  Email pixels/web beacons</p><ul>  <li>You can disable pixels or web beacons in email messages through the settings of your email services to prevent the automatic downloading of images.</li></ul></div> <div><p>  General advertising opt-outs</p><p>  Many companies are members of industry advertising associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and advertising cookies, which help you make choices:</p><ul>  <li>United States: Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance</li><li>Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</li><li>Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance</li></ul><p>  For more information and to exercise your choices regarding Facebook and Google ads:</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Facebook (more info: privacy policy; choices: ad preferences page)</li><li>Google/DoubleClick (more info: privacy policy; choices: ads help page)</li></ul><p>  You can also learn more about online advertising at www.aboutads.info/consumers and opt-out of interest-based advertising from many participating ad companies at the ad industry websites below:</p><ul>  <li>United States: www.aboutads.info</li><li>Canada: www.youradchoices.ca</li><li>Europe: www.youronlinechoices.eu</li></ul><p>  Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings. For more information about how to change these settings for Apple, Android or Windows devices, see:</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that opting-out of advertising network services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our services or other services, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs.</p></p> <p><p>  Do-Not-Track. You may disable certain tracking on our websites, as discussed in this section (for example by disabling Cookies), and you may opt-out of certain third-party ad networks as described in this Section.
