</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  NVIDIA does not use, sell, or share “sensitive personal information” as defined by California law.</p></p> <div><h2>  Sharing Data for Interest-based Advertising</h2><p>  If you’ve consented to receive marketing communications or recommendations, we share hashed details about your identity with third-party ad providers such as Google to serve interest-based ads to you and others. These hashed details may include your name, email, phone number, job title, organizational business affiliations, zip code, country, and social media handles.</p><p>  Your information is shared in hashed form only, which means that your details are irreversibly converted to a fixed-size string of characters such as “0890f456684a70f1a9f1dbcee40c1fe847b76f338581a9a1d9202c76b1c175f4” (which is the SHA-256 hash of “NVIDIA”). Sharing information in hashed form means that third-party ad providers can only identify you if they already have the information we have shared and have hashed it themselves to match the hashed version we are sharing. Sharing information in hashed form is a way of identifying information that both parties have without sharing the information itself.</p></div> <p><p>  You can opt out of data sharing for interest-based advertising at any time by visiting our <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/about-nvidia/privacy-center/" target="_blank"> Privacy Center </a> or by enabling an opt-out preference signal.</p></p> <div><h2>  How to Set Up and Use an Opt-Out Preference Signal</h2><p>  NVIDIA websites detect and respond to Global Privacy Control signals by disabling all Performance and Advertising cookies. If you have consented to marketing communications or recommendations you will need to log into our Privacy Center to disable sharing with third party advertisers. To enable this signal, download and use a browser or browser extension that supports the Global Privacy Control.</p></div> <div><h2>  Data on NVIDIA Websites</h2><p>  If you visit any of our NVIDIA websites, we or our third-party partners collect information using cookies, web beacons, or log file information.

We also don’t collect data if the collection would require parental consent in the relevant jurisdiction.</p><p>  We do not share any data of children under the age of 18 unless sharing is necessary for service functionality. For example, if a user is already an account holder with one of our GeForce NOW Alliance partners, we share the user’s operating system version, network type, games played, session time, ratings and feedback, error data, and a masked version of the user’s IP address with that GeForce NOW Alliance Partner to enable that service’s functionality.</p></div> <p><p>  We employ reasonable technological safeguards to comply with local laws, and to prevent underage children from accessing areas of our services where personal information may be collected. For example, underage children are not allowed to participate in our user-to-user forums, subscribe to an email newsletter, or enter any of our sweepstakes or contests.</p></p> <p><p>  Please contact us if you become aware that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent.</p></p> <div><h2>  Cross-Border Data Transfer </h2><p>  NVIDIA is located in California, and in most cases we need to securely transfer and store your information in the United States. Transfers of personal data to the United States, and to or from NVIDIA, are made subject to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank"> Standard Contractual Clauses  </a>which have been pre-approved by the European Commission and ensure appropriate data protection safeguards. NVIDIA implemented the Standard Contractual Clauses as an additional data protection safeguard because the United States lost the benefit of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target="_blank"> European Commission adequacy decision </a> in July of 2020. In addition, NVIDIA continues to be a member of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, and we are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. This means we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, and accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement, and liability. We are the data controller, and we remain responsible for any of your personal information that is shared with third parties for processing on our behalf.</p></div> <p><p>  NVIDIA has committed to cooperating with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning data transferred from the EU and Switzerland. Under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration to resolve any complaint. We are subject to U.S. law, and we may be required to share data with U.S. law enforcement agencies.
