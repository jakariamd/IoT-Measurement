Cookies ask your browser to store on your device to remember information about you, such as login information.</p><p>  We may also use web beacons. A web beacon, also known as a “web bug”, is usually a pixel on a website that can be used to track whether a user has visited a particular website to deliver targeted advertising. Web beacons are used in combination with cookies, so if you turn off your browser’s cookies, the web beacons will not be able to track your activity. The web beacon will still account for a website visit but will not record your unique information.

For instance, we do not access, host, store or process the content of messages or other information traveling in our network, so we cannot return copies of such data.</p></p> <p><p>  However, when the data involves services where <b> LUMEN </b> operates as a processor, such as information storage and hosting products, we will grant customers access to the data for retrieval or destruction. In most of these cases, we do not have access to information but will help customers as appropriate to address their GDPR obligations relating to retention, destruction and retrieval of data processed by LUMEN products. Typically, customers will have full control of these activities through the tools and functionalities available with the products.</p></p> <div><p>  Q: What GDPR-related language will appear in <b> LUMEN </b> contracts with customers?</p><p>  A: Depending on the specific <b> LUMEN </b> product and customer arrangement, <b> LUMEN </b> acts as a controller, processer, or both.

For instance, we do not access, host, store or process the content of messages or other information traveling in our network, so we cannot return copies of such data.</p></p> <p><p>  However, when the data involves services where <b> LUMEN </b> operates as a processor, such as information storage and hosting products, we will grant customers access to the data for retrieval or destruction.
