Please note that if you consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information to a third party, that third party will apply its own privacy practices. You should carefully review the privacy notice of any third party before providing them with your Personal Information.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>with service providers, advisors or other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets.

You always have the choice to opt-out if you later change your mind. One form of opt-out is clicking the Unsubscribe link in a marketing email. This will remove you from our marketing email list.

The easiest way to do this is by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link in any email you receive from us;</li><li>restrict our processing of your Personal Information if you think that the data is inaccurate, our processing is unlawful, or that we no longer need to process your data for a particular purpose (unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation); and/or</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>object to our processing of your Personal lnformation on grounds relating to your particular situation, where the legal justification for our processing of your Personal Information is our legitimate interest.

You can find a list of the categories of information that we collect and share <a href="/us/california-personal-information-disclosure/" target="_blank"> here </a>.

We do not discriminate against anyone who exercises any of their rights described in this Privacy Policy.</p></div> <div><h3>  Retention of Personal Information</h3><p>  We will only retain your Personal Information to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as required for legitimate business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise permitted by law. When we no longer need to use Personal Information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it.</p><p>  To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p></div> <div><h3>  Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Web Tools</h3><p>  To learn more about how we use cookies, web beacons and other web tools, and how to control which cookies, web beacons and other web tools are used, please see our <a href="/us/cookie-policy/" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Security</h3><p>  We strive to maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the information collected by Belkin websites and Belkin products, although unfortunately the transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p><p>  It is important to note that if you use a computer or device that can be accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted Personal Information. If you do not want your information to be available to others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access.</p></div> <p><p>  We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser. You should also be aware that names that you give your devices (also known as "<i> friendly names </i>") may be detectable by others outside your home, so you should not use Personal Information as part of your friendly names.</p></p> <div><h3>  Updates and Upgrades</h3><p>  Belkin products may be updated or upgraded from time to time to provide additional features, address technical issues, and generally make your user experience better. Some Belkin products include an auto-update feature, which gives us the ability to make updates automatically. In some cases, you can change auto-update options by changing your settings within the Belkin Product account information. In very limited cases, updates may still be automatically applied, regardless of the auto-update setting. For example, we may provide an automatic update that prevents or fixes a security vulnerability or breach to your network.</p></div> <div><h3>  Third Party and Social Media Linked Sites</h3><p>  Belkin websites and online services may contain links to websites or online services operated by third parties.

These features may collect information about your device's IP address, set cookies to facilitate interaction with social media features or link you to a social media website where you may post Personal Information. All interactions with social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing the feature.</p></p> <div><h3>  Forums/Chat Rooms</h3><p>  If you participate in or post information to a discussion forum or chat room on any Belkin website or Belkin Product, you should be aware that the information you provide there will be made broadly available to others, and can be read, collected, forwarded or used by other users of these forums, potentially inside or outside Belkin, who have access to that forum.
