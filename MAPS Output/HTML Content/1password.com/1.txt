It‚Äôs our foundation.</h1><p>  Every design decision in 1Password begins with the safety and privacy of your data in mind.</p></div> <div><h3>  The information you store in 1Password is encrypted, and only you hold the keys to decrypt it. 1Password is designed to protect you from breaches and other threats, and we work with other security experts to make sure our code is rock solid. We can‚Äôt see your 1Password data, so we can‚Äôt use it, share it, or sell it.</h3></div> <div><h2>  Only you have access to your 1Password data.</h2><p>  Your 1Password data is end-to-end encrypted to keep it safe at rest and in transit. Our security recipe starts with AES 256-bit encryption, and we use multiple techniques to make sure only you have access to your information.</p></div> <div><h3>  Your Account Password protects your data on your devices.</h3><p>  Only you know your Account Password: it‚Äôs never stored alongside your data or sent over the network. It protects your data if someone has access to your device.</p></div> <div><h3>  Your Secret Key protects your data off your devices.</h3><p>  Your Secret Key is created locally on your device. It‚Äôs combined with your Account Password to authenticate you with our server and encrypt your 1Password data.</p></div> <div><h3>  Secure Remote Password protects your data in transit.</h3><p>  Your 1Password account uses SRP to authenticate your credentials without sending them over the Internet. It also encrypts all traffic sent to our server.</p></div> <div><h2>  1Password is private by design.</h2><p>  All data saved in your vaults is end-to-end encrypted using secrets that only you know.</p><p>  We only collect the information necessary to provide our services and build you a better 1Password.</p></div> <div><h2>  1Password protects you from breaches and other threats.</h2><p>  1Password security begins with encryption, and we‚Äôve taken additional steps to limit your exposure to threats outside of 1Password.</p></div> <div><h2>  Alerts you to security breaches</h2><p>  Watchtower alerts you about password breaches and other security problems with your 1Password items.</p></div> <div><h2>  Protects you from phishing</h2><p>  You can fool a human, but you can‚Äôt fool 1Password. It only fills your account details on the sites where you saved them.</p></div> <div><h2>  Only works in verified browsers</h2><p>  1Password only fills your details after it verifies that your browser has been signed by an identified developer.</p></div> <div><h2>  Removes secrets from your clipboard</h2><p>  To prevent people or clipboard tools from learning your secrets, 1Password regularly removes item details from the clipboard.</p></div> <div><h2>  Intelligent autofill</h2><p>  1Password securely fills credentials directly into websites, so you don‚Äôt have to type or paste your password.</p></div> <div><h2>  Always requires your input</h2><p>  To protect your data from shoulder surfers and browser-based attacks, 1Password only displays or fills data when you tell it to.</p><p>  1Password complies with the most stringent industry standards for data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p></div> <div><h2>  Secrets Automation</h2><p>  Secure, orchestrate, and manage your company's infrastructure secrets with 1Password Secrets Automation.</p></div> <div><h2>  We describe our security design in our white paper.</h2><p>  We‚Äôve documented our entire security design for experts to review. Here are just a few of the processes we cover:</p><ul>  <li>Tamper-proof, authenticated encryption</li><li>Brute-force protection with PBKDF2</li><li>Secure vault sharing</li><li>Account recovery</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  We use open standards that are scrutinized by the experts.</h2><p>  1Password wasn‚Äôt built in a vacuum. It was developed on top of open standards that anyone with the right skills can investigate, implement, and improve. We collaborate with other security experts to make sure 1Password is rock solid.</p></div> <div><h3>  "The security controls observed in the 1Password application were found to be substantial and unusually impressive."</h3></div> <div><h3>  1Password Business</h3><p>  Everything you need to secure your business and fortify your defenses.</p></div> <div><h3>  1Password Families</h3><p>  A family password manager solution that will bring peace of mind for you and your family.</p><ul>  <li>1Password</li><li>Learn more</li><li>Support</li><li>Locations</li><li>Company</li><li>Downloads</li><li>Web Browser</li><li>Command Line</li><li>Deutsch</li><li>Espa√±ol</li><li>Fran√ßais</li><li>Italiano</li><li>Êó•Êú¨Ë™û</li><li>ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥</li><li>Portugu√™s</li><li>P—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π</li><li>ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá</li><li>ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá</li></ul><p>  üç™ We use cookies to provide necessary functionality and improve your experience.
