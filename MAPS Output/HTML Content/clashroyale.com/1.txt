Other players and users may, for example, see your profile data, in-game activities and read the messages you have posted.</p></div> <div><h4>  Our service providers.</h4><p>  Supercell has vendors who help us to provide the Service. These vendors process your data only at and according to Supercell´s instructions to provide the Service, and perform tasks such as hosting, player support, advertising, analytics and fraud prevention.</p></div> <div><h4>  Other companies and public authorities.</h4><p>  In order to verify payments (with payment providers such as Paypal) and combat fraud and illegal activity, we may process and disclose data with other companies and organizations and provide it to public authorities in response to lawful requests.</p><p>  We may also disclose your data based on your consent, to comply with the law or to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our players or others.</p></div> <div><h4>  Advertising and Social Media partners.</h4><p>  The Service includes features from our partners, such as social media interaction tools, functionalities through application programming interfaces (APIs) or software development kits (SDKs) and in-game advertising.

We will respond to all requests in accordance with applicable laws. To protect your privacy, we may also take additional steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request, such as by requesting you provide us a purchase receipt or other account information, asking you to link your email address with your game account (for example through Supercell ID), or asking you to answer questions regarding your activities on our Services. Once you have verified your identity, you may also designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights on your behalf by providing the agent’s contact information to our customer support staff, as required by applicable law.</p></p> <p><p>  You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment as a result of your exercise of these rights.</p></p> <div><h3>  COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3><p>  Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. Cookies and similar technologies allow us and our partners to store their preferences and track your activities within the Service. Note that our partners may operate under their own privacy policies.</p><p>  We and our partners collect and store information about users' interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies. This allows us to infer the presence of a common user or household behind multiple devices or browsers, for instance, and then link those browsers and devices into a device graph. We do so in order to</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>detect and prevent fraud;</li><li>allow users to use the Service on one device and pick up seamlessly where they left off on another device;</li><li>analytics, personalization and attribution;</li><li>limit the number of times a user is shown the same advertisement, across all known or inferred devices; and/or</li><li>provide personalized advertising on each device that is inferred from the browsing patterns on all of the devices.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For more information (including how to opt out), please visit <a href="https://supercell.com/en/partner-opt-out/" target="_blank"> supercell.com/en/partner-opt-out </a>. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but some parts of the Service may then not function properly.</p></p> <div><h3>  HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA</h3></div> <div><h4>  Security Safeguards.</h4><p>  In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.</p></div> <div><h4>  Data retention.</h4><p>  We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We may for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts, and we may regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p></div> <div><h3>  CHILDREN</h3><p>  Protecting children’s privacy online is very important to us. Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect personal data from children, except as described in the following paragraph.</p><p>  For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the player’s age. For these Services, when a player indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media and chat features, as well as certain types of notification alerts. We also limit the processing of personal data to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that for some of our Services we may use a higher age limit (such as 16) than described in the above two paragraphs. We do this to provide a safe game experience for our players and to protect Young Players.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are a parent or guardian and wish to review personal data collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described above. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data contrary to the above, we will delete any personal data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child’s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.</p></p> <div><h3>  FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3><p>  Please visit <a href="https://supercell.com/en/disclosure-california-residents/" target="_blank"> supercell.com/en/disclosure-california-residents </a> for special disclosures pertaining to California residents.</p></div> <div><h3>  FOR TURKISH RESIDENTS</h3><p>  Please visit <a href="https://supercell.com/en/disclosure-turkish-residents/" target="_blank"> supercell.com/en/disclosure-turkish-residents </a> for special disclosures pertaining to residents in Turkey.</p></div> <div><h3>  FOR SOUTH KOREAN RESIDENTS</h3><p>  Please visit <a href="https://supercell.com/en/disclosure-korea-residents/" target="_blank"> supercell.com/en/disclosure-korea-residents </a> for special disclosures pertaining to residents in South Korea.</p></div> <div><h3>  Old versions of the page</h3></div> <div><h5>  Follow us on</h5></div> <div><h5>  Download our games from</h5><address>  Supercell Oy</address><span>  Jätkäsaarenlaituri 1</span><span>  00180 Helsinki</span><span>  Finland</span><p>  We use cookies to enable site functionality, personalisation and analytics, but it's up to you!
