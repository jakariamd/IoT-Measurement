					Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of online
					behavioral advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only

					collect on our behalf solely for the purpose of providing the contracted service to us.
				</p></div> <p><p>  
					We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security
					measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or
					loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to personal information appropriate to the
					nature of the information concerned. Measures we take include:
				</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
						placing confidentiality requirements on our staff members, service providers and
						advertisers;
					</li><li>
						destroying or permanently anonymizing personal information if it is no longer needed
						for the purposes for which it was collected;
					</li><li>
						following strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal
						information to prevent unauthorized access to it; and
					</li><li>
						using secure communication transmission software (known as "secure sockets layer" or
						"SSL") that encrypts all information you input on our website before it is sent to us.
						SSL is an industry standard encryption protocol and this ensure that the information
						is reasonably protected against unauthorized interception.
					</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
					As the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to
					communicate with us and the security you use to protect User IDs and passwords, please
					take appropriate measures to protect this information.

					purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this privacy policy. Where your

					accounting requirements. We may also store your personal information for longer periods of
					time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any

					personal information on an indefinite basis.

					You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of
					the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is
					unfounded or excessive if permitted by law. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with
					the request in such circumstances. In addition, there may be requests that we are unable
					to process because of other EU legal requirements. If a request is denied, we will notify
					you of the reason.
				</p></p> <p><p>  
					Your request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you
					are the person about whom we collect personal information (or an authorized representative
					for such person). Therefore, please provide us with the following information:
				</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>a clear description of your matter; and</li><li>your contact information</li></ul><p>  
					In addition to the above information, if you are visiting our Websites and/or listening to
					a podcast hosted by Omny Studio, please provide:
				</p><ul>  <li>
						the identity of the data controller/business that we are working with to serve you
						(i.e., the radio station, podcaster, or audio publisher you were listening to); and
					</li><li>the IP address and user agent of the person the personal information relates too.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  
					We will use the information you provide for verification only for the purpose of
					verification. This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not
					disclosed to a requesting person who has no right to receive it. If you are located in the
					EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU Supervisory Authority. However, if
					you have a complaint regarding the processing of your personal information we request that
					you first contact us and we will reply in a timely manner.
				</p></p> <p><p>  
					We may disclose any of the categories of personal information listed in Section 4 above
					and use them for the above-listed purposes or for other business or operational purposes
					compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected. Our
					disclosures of personal information include disclosures to our service providers, which
					are companies that we engage for business purposes to conduct activities on our behalf,
					data aggregators, advertising companies, analytics and advertising tracking companies and
					other companies within the Omny Studio group, the whole as further described in Section 5
					above.
