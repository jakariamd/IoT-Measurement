</p><span>  www.sipgate.de</span><p>  <strong> Name and address of the data protection officer of sipgate GmbH: </strong></p></div> <div><p>  Data Protection Officer</p><p>  ℅ sipgate GmbH</p><p>  Gladbacher Str. 74</p><p>  40219 Düsseldorf, Germany</p><p>  Tel.: +49 (0)211 63 55 55 0</p><p>  datenschutz@sipgate.de</p><p>  <strong> A. General information on data processing </strong></p><p>  <strong> I. Scope of personal data processing </strong></p><p>  This Data Protection Declaration applies to the websites of sipgate as well as the websites operated by sipgate for its affiliated companies.</p><p>  sipgate only processes personal data insofar as required for providing a functioning website as well as contents and sipgate services. Users’ personal data is usually only processed if required for fulfilling contractual or legal obligations or with the user’s consent. Cases where it is impossible to obtain prior consent for effective reasons and the data processing is permitted by law form an exception to this rule.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  In the event of sipgate obtaining consent from the data subject for personal data processing activities, Art. 6 (1) lit. a of the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as “GDPR”) forms the legal basis.</span></span> <p><p>  When processing personal data required for fulfilling an agreement to which the data subject is party, Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR forms the legal basis. The same applies to processing activities required for implementing pre-contractual measures.</p></p> <p><p>  In the event of personal data having to be processed for fulfilling a legal obligation of sipgate, Art. 6 (1) lit. c GDPR forms the legal basis.</p></p> <p><p>  Should essential interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.</p></p> <p><p>  If the processing is required to maintain a justified interest of sipgate or third party, and if the interests, basic rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the interest stated above, Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.</p></p> <p><p>  
<strong> III. Data deletion / storage period </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The personal data of the data subject is deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to exist. Data may also be stored if stipulated by European or national legislation in EU directives, laws or other regulations which apply to sipgate. Data is also blocked or deleted if a storage period stipulated by the above standards expires, unless it is necessary to continue storing the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of an agreement.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Data processing in third countries </strong></p></p> <span><span>  All data processing activities performed in a third county (i.e. a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and European Union (EU)) comply with the provision s of the GDPR.</span></span> <p><p>  We only initiate the processing of personal data in third countries that maintain adequate data protection standards. Adequate data protection standards exist in countries for which the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision. An adequate data protection standard is further assumed for US providers that are certified in accordance with the Privacy Shield. An adequate data protection standard can also be secured with corresponding guarantees, such as the standard contract clauses of the European Commission, existing certifications or binding internal data protection regulations.</p></p> <p><p>  Personal data is furthermore only processed in third countries with explicit consent from the data subject or if prescribed by law or contract.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> B. Log files </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The sipgate systems automatically collect data and information from the system of the accessing computer each time the sipgate websites are accessed.</p></p> <div><p>  The following data is collected during this process:</p><p>  Information on the browser type and version, the user’s operating system, internet service provider and IP address, date and time of access, websites from which the user’s system is referred to sipgate’s website, and websites accessed by the user’s system through the sipgate website(s).</p><p>  The data is also stored in the sipgate log files. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.</p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for processing </strong></p></div> <p><p>  Data and log files are temporarily stored on the legal basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The system has to temporarily store the user’s IP address to display the website on the user’s computer. The user’s IP address has to be stored for the duration of the session for this purpose.</p></p> <p><p>  It is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. We also use this data to optimise the website and ensure the security of our IT systems. The data is not analysed for marketing purposes in this respect.</p></p> <p><p>  The above-stated purpose also constitutes the justified interest of sipgate in the data processing in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Storage period </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for fulfilling the purpose for which it was collected. If the data is collected for displaying the website, this is the point at which the respective session ends.</p></p> <p><p>  If the data is stored in log files, it is deleted no later than seven days from being collected. Data may be stored for longer periods than the ones stated above. In such event, the user’s IP address is deleted or alienated so that it is no longer possible to allocate it to the accessing client and this data no longer links to a specific person.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> V. Option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The collection of data for displaying the website and storage of data in log files is crucial for operating the website. The user therefore has no option to object.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> C. Use of cookies </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files stored in the browser and/or by the browser on the user’s computer system. A cookie may be stored on the user’s operating system if the user accesses a website. This cookie contains a characteristic sequence which makes it possible to clearly identify the browser when the website is accessed again.</p></p> <p><p>  We use cookies to create a more user-friendly website. Some elements on our website require for the accessing browser to be identified even after switching pages.</p></p> <div><p>  The following data is stored and transferred in the cookies for this purpose:</p><p>  language settings, shopping basket items, log-in information, browser type, operating system, referrer URL (previously visited page), time of server request and IP address.</p><p>  We also use cookies that make it possible to analyse the user’s surfing behaviour on our website(s). </p><p>  The following data can be transferred in this manner: </p><p>  browser type, operating system, referrer URL (previously visited page), time of server request and IP address. </p></div> <p><p>  The user data collected in this manner is pseudonymised by technical features. Once this process has been completed, it is no longer possible to allocate the data to the accessing user. The data is stored separately to other personal user data.</p></p> <p><p>  When accessing our website(s), users are informed about the use of cookies for analysis purposes and referred to this Data Protection Declaration on an information banner. Information on how the storage of cookies can be prevented by adjusting the browser settings is also provided.</p></p> <p><p>  You may opt out of non-essential cookies by changing your cookie preferences (Link “Cookie Settings” in footer).</p></p> <p><p>  Certain third parties provide ways to opt out of advertising cookies across multiple sites. You can learn more by visiting the sites of the Network Advertising Initiative (</p></p> <span><span>  https://optout.networkadvertising.org</span></span> <div><span>  ) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (</span><span>  https://www.aboutads.info</span><span>  ). In addition, there are third party plug-ins and apps that help manage cookies.</span><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for data processing </strong></p><p>  The legal basis for the processing of personal data and use of technically required cookies is Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.</p><p>  Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR forms the legal basis for processing personal data whilst using cookies for analysis purposes with the user’s consent.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> III. Storage period, option to object and delete the data </strong> </p></p> <p><p>  Cookies are stored on the user’s computer from where they are transferred to sipgate. You, the user, have full control over the use of cookies. You can adjust your browser settings to deactivate or limit the transfer of cookies. Previously stored cookies can be deleted at any time (also automatically). Deactivating cookies on the sipgate website may result in not all of the website functions being fully usable.</p></p> <p><p>  We ask for your consent before any non-essential cookies are set. </p></p> <p><p>  You may opt out of non-essential cookies by changing your cookie preferences (Link “Cookie Settings” in footer).</p></p> <div><p>  You can also object to the use of cookies on the following websites:</p><p>  http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</p><p>  http://www.aboutads.info/choices</p><p>  http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices/</p><p>  <strong> D. Consentmanager (Cookie-Consent-Tool) </strong></p><p>  <strong> I. Scope of personal data processing </strong></p><span>  We have integrated the consent management tool „consentmanager“ (</span><span>  www.consentmanager.net</span><span>  ) from Jaohawi AB (Håltgelvågen 1b, 72348 Västerås, Sweden, info@consentmanager.net) on our website to obtain consent for data processing and use of cookies or comparable functions. With the help of „consentmanager“ you have the possibility to give your consent for certain functionalities of our website, e.g. for the purpose of integrating external elements, integrating streaming content, statistical analysis, measurement and personalized advertising. With the help of “consentmanager” you can grant or reject your consent for all functions or give your consent for individual purposes or individual functions. The settings you have made can also be changed afterwards. The purpose of integrating “consentmanager” is to let the users of our website decide about the above-mentioned things and, as part of the further use of our website, to offer the option of changing settings that have already been made. By using “consentmanager”, personal data and information from the end devices used, such as the IP address, are processed.</span></div> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. c) in conjunction with Art. 6 para. 3 sentence 1 lit. a) in conjunction with Art. 7 para. 1 GDPR and, in the alternative, lit. f). By processing the data, we help our customers (according to GDPR this is the responsible party) to fulfill their legal obligations (e.g. obligation to provide evidence). Our legitimate interests in processing lie in the storage of user settings and preferences with regard to the use of cookies and other functionalities.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> III. Data deletion / storage period </strong></p></p> <span><span>  „Consentmanager“ stores your data as long as your user settings are active. One year after making the user settings, the consent will be asked again. The user settings made are then saved again for this period.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <span><span>  You can object to the processing. You have the right to object to reasons arising from your particular situation. To object, please send an email to info@consentmanager.net.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> E. Newsletter </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Any email address entered by you when purchasing goods or services on the sipgate website may be used by sipgate to send you a newsletter. The newsletter exclusively contains direct advertising for our own goods and services. </p></p> <span><span>  You can also subscribe to the newsletter of sipgate GmbH without purchasing goods and services. </span></span> <span><span>  We engage external service providers for sending the newsletter. </span></span> <span><span>  We record the number of opened and delivered newsletters in this respect.</span></span> <p><p>  The newsletters contain a web beacon, i.e. a one-pixel file which is accessed by the server of our service provider when the newsletter is opened. Technical information, such as on your browser and system as well as your IP address and time of request, is collected as part of this request. This information is used for improving the technical aspects of the service on the basis of technical data or the target groups and their read behaviour based on their request locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or access times.</p></p> <p><p>  The statistical data collected also includes the determination if the newsletters have been opened and when and which links have been clicked. This information can be allocated to the individual newsletter recipients for technical reasons. However, neither we nor our service provider intend to monitor individual users. The analyses merely serve for us to recognise the read behaviour of our users and to adjust our contents accordingly or to send different contents that meet our users’ interests.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Section 7 (3) of the Unfair Competition Act (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb – UWG) forms the legal basis for sending the newsletter following the sale of goods or services. </p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR forms the basis for recording the number of opened and delivered newsletters.</span></span> <p><p>  If the user explicitly subscribes to receive newsletters, the legal bases for sending the newsletter and recording the number of opened and delivered newsletters are Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR and Art. 7 GDPR.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Email addresses and user names are collected for delivering a personalised newsletter.</p></p> <p><p>  The number of opened and delivered newsletters is recorded to recognise potential technical problems and to improve the contents. This purpose also constitutes sipgate’s justified interest in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Storage period </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for fulfilling the purpose for which it was collected. The user email address is therefore stored for as long as the newsletter subscription remains active.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> V. Option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The affected user can cancel the newsletter subscription at any time. A corresponding link is included in every newsletter for this purpose.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> F. Contact form </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The sipgate website contains contact forms that can be used for contacting the company via electronic channels. If the user decides to use this option, the data entered in the input mask is transferred to sipgate and stored.</p></p> <p><p>  This data includes: email address, customer number and phone number, if required.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for storage </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Art. 6 (1) lit. a GDPR forms the legal basis for data processing with the user’s consent.</p></p> <p><p>  The legal basis for processing data transferred as part of an email is provided by Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. If the email contact aims at concluding an agreement, Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR forms an additional legal basis for processing.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  sipgate exclusively processes personal data from the input masks for processing the contact request. In the case of contact being made via email, this also constitutes the necessary and justified interest in processing the data.</p></p> <p><p>  The other personal data processed during the send process serves to prevent the misuse of the contact form and ensure the security of sipgate’s IT systems.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Storage period </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for fulfilling the purpose for which it was collected. For the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those sent via email, this is the case once the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation has been concluded once the respective matter has been clarified in full and final.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> V. Option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The user may withdraw its consent for processing the personal data at any time. In such case, the conversation cannot be continued.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> G. Zendesk </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  sipgate uses tools provided by Zendesk Inc., 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, for collecting and processing customer requests. When customers contact sipgate via email or chat, their email address, customer number and any other information sent are stored by zendesk.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR forms the legal basis for processing data which is transferred as part of an email or chat. If the contact aims at concluding or fulfilling an agreement, Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR forms the legal basis for processing.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The personal data is exclusively processed for finding a specific solution to customer queries whilst recording and/or processing them. It is essential in this respect for sipgate to be able to contact the respective customer.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Storage period, deletion, option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Users may request the deletion of their personal data at any time. In such case, the conversation cannot be continued.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> H. DialogFlow </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description, scope and purpose of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We use a chatbot on some of our websites. The Dialog­flow software by Google Inc. used for this purpose uses machine learning for improving its understanding of and responses to input and queries. The data that has been entered is sent to servers spread around the globe for this purpose. All chats are stored without any references to natural persons. The dialogues exclusively serve to improve the chat system and are used for analyses only.</p></p> <p><p>  Personal data is neither queried nor required at any stage of the chatbot system. The user’s browser only creates a direct connection to the Dialog-flow server once explicit consent to call up the chatbot has been given. This gives Dialog-flow access to the IP address and information on the browser, operating system and device used. Dialog-flow may install cookies in the user’s browser.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The justified interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR is training purposes and learning from your input and queries.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> I. Fonts </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We engage the services of the copyright holders of fonts for displaying various fonts. To do so, the IP address of the querying computer is transferred to the copyright holder supplying the font.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR forms the basis for the processing of personal data. </span></span> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The display of the sipgate website(s) in the requested font.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Storage period, deletion, option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The IP address is deleted immediately after accessing the font.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> J. Gravatar </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Website visitors can leave comments on some of the websites of sipgate GmbH. To do so, visitors have to give an email address.</span></span> <p><p>  When a new comment is stored, sipgate GmbH fully automatically checks if the website visitor has a Gravatar account based on the email address provided by the visitor.</p></p> <p><p>  Gravatar is a service by Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA, that is used to ensure that a profile picture is uploaded only once centrally to be displayed on all websites visited that contain a comment or similar function.</p></p> <p><p>  If no Gravatar account has been created for the requested email address, Gravatar immediately deletes the requested email address.</p></p> <p><p>  If a Gravatar account has been created for the requested email address, the profile picture of the respective user is automatically displayed on the websites of sipgate GmbH, together with the comments of this user.</p></p> <p><p>  No other data is stored in this respect.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR forms the basis for the processing of personal data.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> III.

Google </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We use the services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, for our work as well as internal and external communication. As part of our work, various personal data (such as IP address of the querying computer, your name, your email address and other data processed during the conclusion of an agreement and/or its performance by us) is stored on Google servers, if required for the performance of the agreement or communication with the customer.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. b and f GDPR forms the basis for the processing of personal data. </span></span> <p><p>  <strong> III.

Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  sipgate uses the service of Google Maps by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, on some of its websites. When using Google Maps, information on the use of the accessed webpages, including your IP address and the start address entered during route planning, may be transmitted to Google. When you access a webpage containing Google Maps, your browser establishes a direct connection to Google servers. Google transmits the map content directly to your browser which integrates it in the website. We do not have any influence over the scope of the data thus collected by Google.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Displaying an interactive map with route planner.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Duration of storage, erasure, option to object and remove the data </strong></p></p> <span><span>  You can deactivate JavaScript in your browser if you object to the collection of data by Google Maps. However, you will not be able to see the map or plan your route in this case.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> M. Calendly </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  We use the service of Calendly, 271 17th St NW, Ste 1000, Atlanta, GA 30363, USA., for arranging certain appointments. If a user uses this option, their email address, name and phone number, if applicable, are collected and stored.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> II. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR forms the basis for the processing of this data. If the arrangement of an appointment aims at concluding an agreement, Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR forms an additional legal basis for processing.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> III. Purpose of processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The data is processed for the sole reason of arranging appointments between sipgate and the user in an uncomplicated manner. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> IV. Storage period, deletion, option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The data is deleted if no longer required and we are not obliged to store it by law.</span></span> <p><p>  If the user objects to the use of the service provided by Calendly, the user can always arrange appointments in a different manner (e.g. email or phone).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> N. Web analysis </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> I. Google Tag Manager </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Google Tag Manager is a solution that permits us to manage website tags via an interface (and therefore integrate Google Analytics and other Google marketing services in our websites). The Tag Manager does not process any personal user data in itself. Please refer to the descriptions of the individual Google services with regard to the processing of personal user data.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> II. Google Analytics </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 1. Description and scope of personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The sipgate website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Analytics uses cookies which are stored on the user’s computer and which make it possible to analyse the user’s use of the website. This enables sipgate to analyse the use of the website(s) and thus create even more user-friendly contents.</span></span> <p><p>  The additional “User ID” function is also integrated on some websites.</p></p> <p><p>  The User ID is a unique, permanent and non-personalised character sequence which we allocate to you as a person and not to a specific device. It enables us to record your visit and user behaviour on our website from various devices (e.g. smartphone, tablet or laptop). The User ID is only allocated to you if we can clearly identify you as a user. This generally is the case when you register for the first time on our website. We do not combine the data collected under the User ID with personal data. We only transfer the pseudonymised User ID to Google Universal Analytics and use it as your pseudonym when dealing with Google. Other data and information relating to your account is not transferred to Google. Your user behaviour on our websites is then transferred to the Google servers in the USA, together with your User ID, where it is stored and processed for analysis purposes. Google links the transferred information to pseudonymised user profiles and provides sipgate with a summary of them. sipgate does not combine these transferred user profiles with your personal data. This makes it impossible to allocate the data to specific persons at all times.</p></p> <p><p>  sipgate has activated IP anonymisation (“_anonymizeIP()” extension) on this website. This means that IP addresses are recorded anonymously by way of IP masking to remove any direct link to persons. The full IP address is only transferred to Google servers in the USA and abbreviated there in exceptional circumstances. The IP address is usually abbreviated within the member states of the European Union or other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area and transferred to Google servers in the USA in abbreviated form.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2. Legal basis for personal data processing </strong></p></p> <span><span>  Art. 6 (1) lit. a and f GDPR forms the basis for the processing of personal data. The above purpose also constitutes sipgate’s justified interest in the processing of personal data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> 3. Purpose of data processing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Google uses this information on behalf of sipgate for analysing the use of the latter’s website, for compiling website activity reports and for providing other services relating to the use of the internet and website for sipgate. Google does not combine the IP address transferred by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics with other data.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4. Storage period </strong></p></p> <span><span>  The data is stored for a maximum period of 26 months.</span></span> <p><p>  <strong> 5. Option to object and delete the data </strong></p></p> <span><span>  You may opt out of non-essential cookies by changing your cookie preferences (Link “Cookie Settings” in footer).</span></span> <p><p>  You can adjust your browser settings to block the storage of cookies. However, we would like to point out that you may no longer be able to fully use all of the functions on this website in this case. You can also prevent the transfer of the data created by the cookie that relates to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the respective browser plug-in from the following link (</p></p> <span><span>  http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</span></span> <span><span>  ).

In the Google advertising network, the ads are distributed via an automatic algorithm and based on the previously determined key words and target groups on relevant websites. The purpose of Google Ads is to advertise our website by displaying relevant advertising on third-party websites and in the Google search results.</span></div> <p><p>  We also use the Google Ads remarketing function.

This enables Microsoft Bing and us to recognise that a person has clicked on an ad, was transferred to our website and reached a pre-determined conversion page. We only see the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were transferred to a conversion page. Microsoft collects, processes and uses cookie information that is used for creating pseudonymised user profiles.

We aim to display ads that are of interest to users. This process uses a cookie that is installed in the browser through which the user behaviour is recorded and analysed. No personal information on the individual website visitors is disclosed to us and we can only target our ads at website customer target groups once they have reached a critical number.
