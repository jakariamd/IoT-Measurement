These Analytics & Sponsorship Services may include:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Google Analytics 4, Google Universal Analytics, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Ad Manager, and the services of our other vendors. These Analytics & Sponsorship Services may use cookies, pixel tags, hash values, and other tracking and storage technologies to collect, receive, or share information (this shared information does not include your unhashed name or email address you register with NPR) from our Services and elsewhere on the Internet and use that information to analyze and measure our audience and target and evaluate the effectiveness of sponsorship credits and marketing messages in our Services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>First-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the Remarketing with Google Analytics and DoubleClick cookies) that may be used together to inform, optimize, and serve sponsorship credits based on your past interactions with our Services and other websites or services.</li><li>In connection with an affiliate-marketing relationship with platforms such as Apple or online retailers, third-party analytics services working with us and such platforms or online retailers may also use cookies to uniquely identify the browsers of (i) users who click on marketing messages we display to promote our podcasts available through Apple Podcasts or iTunes and then later purchase a podcast subscription through Apple, or (ii) users who click on links to an online retailer in NPR content mentioning books, music, or other related merchandise and then later purchase that merchandise on the online retailer's site.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>When you use our Services and enter your email address on our Services (either to log in, or to sign up for a newsletter, or take similar actions), we may share with vendors, such as LiveRamp, information that we collect from you, such as a hash value based on your email address, IP address, or information about your browser or operating system. These vendors, such as LiveRamp, act as "joint controllers" (as applicable depending on the law where you live) in processing this information. Vendors, like LiveRamp, use this information to create an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel sponsorship and marketing messages, and for the purpose of recognizing your devices. This code does not contain any of your directly identifiable personal information and will not be used by vendors, such as LiveRamp, to determine your name or email address, or to otherwise directly identify you. The identification code may be shared with sponsorship vendors to enable "interest-based" and targeted sponsorship and marketing messages.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>In addition, we may use analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographic, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences, make improvements, and for other operational purposes.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  An Analytics & Sponsorship Service's ability to use and share information is covered by that service's terms of use and privacy policy.

We want you to understand when and with whom we and service providers and vendors may share personal information about you that is collected through our Services. </p><p>  <em> The public or other individuals </em></p><p>  Any User Materials you submit through our <a href="https://help.npr.org/contact/s/contact?request=NPR-Management" target="_blank"> Contact Us </a> page, social media services or similar features can be seen, collected and used by us and anyone else who has access to the applicable service. Any User Materials you submit may also be freely used and shared by NPR and its Member stations and their respective licensees in accordance with our <a href="https://www.npr.org/179876898" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a>. You may also choose to share stories or other content with your friends and followers on social media services. In addition, we may share your information with other individuals at your direction. For example, if you use our Services to email or text a story to a friend, we would disclose your name to that friend together with the content you directed us to send.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Member stations </em></p><p>  NPR may share your name, email address, other contact information, and information about your subscriptions, benefits (such as the NPR+ bundle), listening and usage activity, donations and interests with the Member stations that are associated with your account, that are local to you, or that you have donated to using the NPR Services. When we do so, we require those Member stations to commit to the same policies regarding further sharing with third parties that we follow under this Privacy Policy. Member stations may use this information for internal purposes and to send you email newsletters and marketing, fundraising, membership and other communications. If you do not want us to share your information with Member stations, you can <a href="https://help.npr.org/contact/s/contact?request=NPR-Management" target="_blank"> contact us </a> to opt out as set out in the <a href="#yourchoices" target="_blank"> Privacy Rights and Choices </a> section below. </p></div> <div><p>  <em> Authorized service providers </em></p><p>  We may share any information we collect with service providers who provide us with specialized services or otherwise help us operate our Services including, without limitation, service providers that provide customer support, email deployment, account sign-in services, subscription services, payment processing, order fulfillment, analytics, marketing, sponsorship, suppression list management, travel program, contest management and data processing services. </p></div> <div><p>  <em> Sponsorship and marketing vendors </em></p><p>  Subject to applicable law and your opt-out choices described below and in our <a href="https://www.npr.org/609791368" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>, and as we deem appropriate, we may share with sponsorship and marketing vendors, including those who provide digital sponsorship credits and marketing messages for us, or allow them to directly collect information about your devices and your use of our Services. We will not share your name or contact information in unhashed form with these vendors. These vendors may use such information pursuant to their own respective privacy policies, which we do not control. </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>For example, we may share or authorize the collection of such information by vendors that help us analyze and improve our Services (including sponsorship credits and marketing messages in our Services), or to tailor sponsorship credits and marketing messages to your perceived interests. In order to provide sponsorship credits and marketing messages tailored to your perceived interests, vendors may use and further share information with other third parties such as supply-side platforms or services (working with us) and demand-side platforms or services (working with us and sponsors) in order to enable "interest-based" sponsorship. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>As described above, we may work with third-party analytics services to set tracking cookies or pixels on browsers of users who click on marketing messages for podcast subscriptions sold through Apple Podcasts or iTunes, or users who click on links to an online retailer in content mentioning books, music, or other related merchandise and then later purchase that merchandise on the online retailer's site. We do this to measure the performance of these marketing messages and to facilitate the calculation of commissions we may receive when a person subscribes to one of our podcasts available through Apple Podcasts or iTunes, or when a person purchases the mentioned merchandise on the online retailer's site. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>For example, as described above, when you enter your email address on our Services (either to log in, or to sign up for a newsletter, or take similar actions), we may share with vendors, such as LiveRamp, information that we collect from you, such as a hash value based on your email address, IP address, or information about your browser or operating system. Vendors, like LiveRamp, use this information – which does not contain your directly identifiable personal information and which these vendors will not use to determine your name or email address, or to otherwise directly identify you – to create an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel sponsorship and marketing messages, and for the purpose of recognizing your devices. The identification code may be shared with sponsorship vendors to enable "interest-based" and targeted sponsorship and marketing messages.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> Payment processors </strong></p><p>  If you wish to make a payment or receive a refund through our Services, your information will be collected and controlled by the payment processor and not by us and will be subject to that payment service provider's privacy policy and practices.</p><p>  <em> Professional advisors </em></p><p>  We may share with professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers and insurers, where necessary, in the course of the professional services that they render to us.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Authorized third-party applications </em></p><p>  We may share with authorized third-party applications information that you provide directly through our Services and information collected automatically through technology for the purpose of providing certain NPR Services to you on the applications. In such cases, the information that we share may include your name, favorite Member stations, and listening and usage activity. NPR prohibits the third-party developers of those applications from accessing, storing or sharing any such information. However, please be aware that your use of the third-party application is otherwise subject to the third-party application's privacy policy, which we do not control and which may differ significantly from ours. NPR is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third-party application, and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any third-party sites, applications, platforms, and services that you visit or access.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Business transfers </em></p><p>  We may share any collected information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of an NPR Service or division, a merger, a consolidation, an asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p><p>  <em> Legal requirements  </em></p><p>  We and service providers and vendors may disclose any collected information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, legal process, and other law enforcement measures, and to comply with legal or regulatory obligations. </p></div> <div><p>  <em> Protect our Services and users </em></p><p>  We and service providers and vendors may disclose any collected information to enforce our <a href="http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a> and to protect and defend the legal rights, interests, and safety of NPR, NPR Member stations, their respective employees, agents, contractors, sponsors, listeners and users, members of the general public, or others.</p><p>  <em> Wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers </em></p></div> <p><p>  Wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers also may collect contact and other information and precise location data from our mobile services users through processes we do not control. You should check the privacy policies of your wireless carriers and automobile manufacturers for additional information.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> Podcast producers </em></p><p>  We may share with third-party producers listening, usage and other data that does not identify you that we collect through your interaction with the podcasts and other media files produced by those third-party producers.</p><p>  <em> Bitly </em></p><p>  NPR uses a service called Bitly to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs – the addresses of individual web pages) for our content so that it can be shared easily, particularly through social media. Bitly collects information as our shortened URLs are shared and clicked on, including IP addresses, general location information, the time and day each shortened URL is accessed, and the social media or other channels through which our content is shared. If you have established a separate account with Bitly, Bitly may associate the foregoing information with personal information it has stored in your Bitly account in accordance with Bitly's own <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy" target="_blank"> privacy policy </a>. To share our content without using Bitly, copy the full URL of the story you want to share from your browser and paste it into your email, text or social media message.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> Aggregated and anonymous information </em> </p><p>  Subject to applicable law and your opt-out choices described below, and as we deem appropriate, we may share with third parties or allow them to collect directly aggregated or other information that is not reasonably linkable to you or your devices. These third parties may use such information pursuant to their own respective privacy policies, which we do not control. For example, we may share or authorize the collection of such information by service providers or vendors that help us analyze and improve our Services, provide us and other digital media organizations with ratings and ranking data, or help us to create personalized content. We may also share or authorize the collection of such information by sponsors or their agencies to help them measure the impact of their sponsorship campaigns.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Privacy Rights and Choices </strong></p><p>   You have the following choices to update, correct and limit the collection and use of information gathered through our Services.</p><ul>  <li><em> Manage cookie settings and opt out of interest-based sponsorship credits and marketing messages on NPR.org </em> You can manage your cookie settings, including accepting or rejecting cookies, by clicking the "Cookie Settings & Opt Out" button above. Clicking on that button, and following the instructions, will also allow you to opt out of the sharing of your information with our sponsorship vendors for delivery of "interest-based" sponsorship credits and marketing messages on NPR.org. If you opt out, those vendors may continue to serve you non-personalized, non-interest-based sponsorship credits and marketing messages on NPR.org. Note that this opt out is a cookie-based process and will only affect the specific computer, device, and browser on which your opt-out choice is applied. If you subsequently delete your browser cookies or if your browser cookies expire, you will need to opt out again. For additional information regarding the cookies and similar technologies used in the NPR Services and how to opt out of interest-based sponsorship and marketing messages, read our <a href="https://www.npr.org/609791368" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings. </em>Your mobile device settings can provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based sponsorship purposes.For iOS mobile devices, go to "Settings" from your device's home screen, scroll down to find and select "Privacy," and then select "Tracking" to adjust tracking permission. For Android mobile devices, go to "Google Settings" on your device, select "Ads"; and click the option labeled "Delete advertising ID." (Please note these settings allow you to opt out of interest-based messages for all applications, not just NPR's mobile applications. These device settings options may change in the future or otherwise may differ for certain devices; consult your device manufacturer's support literature for the most current information.) As noted above, if you opt out, you may still receive the same number of sponsorship credits and marketing messages as before but they may not be as relevant to your interests. Because these opt out mechanisms are specific to the device on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on every device that you use.

We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable, or comply as required by law. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting an update or cancellation. Depending on where you reside, you may be entitled to empower an "authorized agent" to submit requests on your behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in accordance with applicable laws. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.</p></p> <p><p>  In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, our ability to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights, or may interfere with our rights to free speech and free press or to engage in other protected journalism activities.

Because no security system is impenetrable, however, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases or that information you supply will never be intercepted, accessed, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Because most email and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email, text message, or other mobile transmissions.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Children </strong>'<strong> s Privacy </strong></p><p>  NPR cares about protecting the privacy of children.

You also may access NPR content and the NPR Services from a third-party site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not. NPR is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party services and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any such sites or services you visit or access.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Job Applicants </strong></p><p>   When you visit the <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/750004/careers" target="_blank"> Careers </a> portion of the website, we collect the information that you provide to us in connection with your application for a job, internship, or fellowship at NPR.

We use this information to help operate the NPR Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on the NPR Services. NPR's third-party service providers that measure and analyze the use of the NPR Services for NPR also use their own cookies.
