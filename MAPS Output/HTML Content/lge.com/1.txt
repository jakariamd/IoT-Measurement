Inc. (“<strong> LGEUS </strong>”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “<strong> LG </strong>,” “<strong> we </strong>” or “<strong> us </strong>”) has the ability to collect information, from and about its consumers in a number of ways. This information, including personal information, is enormously helpful to us as we strive to further develop and promote our products and services and to enhance your experience while using them. We appreciate that you trust us with your information, and we understand that not everyone wants to share their information in the same way. We respect your rights and choices when it comes to what information is collected and how it is used. In this Privacy Policy, you will find a description of how we collect personal information, the types of personal information LG collects, how it is used and shared, and how long it is retained. We also explain how to communicate your preferences and exercise your rights regarding your information.</p></div> <p><p>  While LG provides many products and services, this Privacy Policy applies only to (i) LG websites where it is posted or referenced (“LG Websites”), (ii) LG connected devices (such as home appliances), (iii) the ThinQ mobile app (“ThinQ App”), (iv) the LG Account, (v) the LG Chatbot, (vi) LG customer service calls, (vii) our marketing and sales activities and other communications (including by email and SMS/text message), (viii) LG product registration, and (ix) any other product or service that links to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Services”).</p></p> <p><p>  For LG Smart TV, LG Channels, or Smart Media Product users, please see the separate Smart TV Privacy Policy for details of how LG processes personal information in the course of providing its Smart TV / Media Product service. Please note that we may combine information we collect among our services, including the Services described above as well as the Smart TV / Media Product service, and across your devices for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  LG is also excited to offer you the opportunity to sign up for an “LG Account” to access and manage many of the Services as well as other offerings that are not covered under this Privacy Policy, such as Smart TV and LG Developer. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of an LG Account, which constitutes a “Service” as that term is used in this Privacy Policy, but additional offerings are subject to their own privacy policies and to the extent that there are any inconsistencies between this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy applicable to the particular offering, the privacy policy applicable to the offering will prevail.</p></p> <div><h2>  A.
