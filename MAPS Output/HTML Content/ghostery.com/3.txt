General information</h2><p>  This section of the data privacy statement contains information on the scope of validity, the person responsible for data processing (controller), the data protection officer and data security. It also begins with a list of definitions of important terms used in the data privacy statement.</p></div> <div><h3>  I. Definition of main terms</h3><p>  Browser:</p><span>   Computer program used to display websites (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari)</span><p>  Cookies:</p><span>   Text files placed on the user’s computer by the web server by means of the browser which is used. The stored cookie information may contain both an identifier (cookie ID) for recognition purposes and content data, such as login status or information about websites visited. The </span><span>  browser</span><span>   sends the cookie information back to the web server with each new request upon subsequent repeat visits to these sites. Most </span></div> <div><span>  browsers</span><span>   accept </span><span>  cookies</span><span>   automatically. </span><span>  Cookies</span><span>   can be managed using the browser functions (usually under “Options” or “Settings”). The storage of </span><span>  cookies</span><span>   may be disabled in this way or it may be made dependent on the user’s approval in any given case or otherwise restricted. </span><span>  Cookies</span><span>   may also be deleted at any time.</span><p>  Third countries:</p><span>   Countries outside of the European Union (EU)</span></div> <div><p>  GDPR:</p><span>   Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the </span><span>  processing</span><span>   of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), available </span><span>  here</span><p>  Personal data:</p><span>   Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</span></div> <div><p>  Profiling:</p><span>   Any form of automated </span><span>  processing</span><span>   of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</span><p>  Services:</p><span>   Our offers to which this data privacy statement applies (cf. Scope of validity).</span></div> <div><p>  Tracking:</p><span>   The collection of data and their evaluation regarding the behaviour of visitors in response to our services.</span><p>  Tracking technologies:</p><span>   Actions can be </span><span>  tracked</span><span>   either via the activity records stored on our web servers (log files) or by collecting data from end devices via </span><span>  pixels</span><span>  cookies</span><span>   or similar </span><span>  tracking</span><span>   technologies.</span><p>  Processing:</p><span>   Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</span></div> <div><p>  Pixel:</p><p>  Pixels</p><span>   are also called tracking pixels, web beacons or web bugs. These are small, invisible graphics in HTML emails or on websites. When a document is opened, this small image is downloaded from a server on the Internet and the download is registered there. This allows the operator of the server to see if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited. This function is usually carried out by calling up a small program (JavaScript). Certain types of information can be detected on your computer system in this way and shared, such as the content of </span></div> <div><span>  cookies</span><span>  , the time and date of the visit, and a description of the page on which the tracking pixel is located.</span></div> <div><h3>  II. Scope of validity</h3><p>  This data privacy statement applies to the following services:</p><ul>  <li>Our </li></ul><span>  online offering “Ghostery”</span><span>   (website), mainly available at </span><span>  https://www.ghostery.com</span><ul>  <li>Whenever reference is made to this Privacy Policy from one of </li></ul><span>  our further offers</span><span>   (e.g. websites, subdomains, mobile applications, web services or links to third-party sites), regardless of the way in which it is accessed or used.</span></div> <div><p>  All of these offers are also collectively referred to as “</p><span>  services</span><span>  ”.</span></div> <div><h3>  III. Controller</h3><p>  The following party is responsible for the processing of data in relation to the services, i.e. the role of controller which involves determining the purposes and means of processing personal data:</p></div> <div><h3>  IV. Data protection officer</h3><p>  The contact details of our data protection officer are given in </p><span>  III. Controller</span><span>  . Messages should be marked for the attention of the data privacy department or sent to </span><span>  privacy@ghostery.com</span></div> <div><h3>  V. General information about the data processing operations</h3><p>  The following applies to all the processing operations listed below, unless stated otherwise:</p></div> <div><h4>  a) No obligation to provide personal data & consequences of failure to provide such data</h4><p>  The provision of personal data is not required by law or contract, and you are under no obligation to provide any data. We will inform you during the data entry process when personal information must be provided for the relevant service (e.g. by indicating “mandatory field”). In cases where the provision of data is required, the consequence of not providing data will be that the service in question cannot be provided. Otherwise, failure to provide data may result in our inability to provide our services in the same form and quality.</p></div> <div><h4>  b) Consent</h4><p>  In various cases, you may also grant us your consent to the further processing of data (or some of the data, where applicable) in connection with the operations listed below. In this case, we will inform you separately in connection with the submission of the respective declaration of consent about all the procedures and the scope of the consent and concerning the purposes which we pursue in these processing operations. The processing operations based on your consent are therefore not listed again here (Art. 13 (4) GDPR).</p></div> <div><h4>  c)	Transfer of personal data to third countries</h4><p>  When we send data to third countries, i.e. countries outside of the European Union, the data are then transmitted strictly in compliance with the statutory conditions of admissibility.
</p><span>  If the transmission of the data to a third country does not serve the purpose of fulfilling our contract with you, if we do not have your consent, if the transmission is not required for asserting, exercising or defending legal claims, and if no other exemption applies under Art. 49 GDPR, we will only transmit your data to a third country if in possession of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR or appropriate guarantees under Art. 46 GDPR.
</span></div> <span><span>  In order to ensure an adequate level of data protection, we provide appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 (2) c) GDPR by the conclusion of EU standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with the receiving body. Copies of the standard EU data protection clauses are available on the website of the European Commission here.</span></span> <div><h4>  d)	Hosting at external service providers</h4><p>  Our data processing work is carried out to a large extent with the involvement of hosting service providers who provide us with storage space and processing capacities at their data centres and who also process personal data on our behalf according to our instructions. It may be the case that personal data are transmitted to hosting service providers in respect of all of the functions listed below. These service providers process data either exclusively in the EU or subject to guaranteed levels of data protection which we have put in place based on the standard EU data protection clauses (cf. subsection c).</p></div> <div><h4>  e)	Transmission to government authorities</h4><p>  In principle, we do not transmit any data to government authorities.
</p><span>  We only send personal information to government authorities (including law enforcement agencies) when required to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject (legal basis: Art. 6 (1) c) GDPR) or when it is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims (legal basis: Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR).</span></div> <div><h4>  f)	Period of storage</h4><p>  The time specified in the “period of storage” paragraph indicates how long we use the data for the relevant purposes in any given case. At the end of this period, the data will no longer be processed by us but will be erased at regular intervals, unless continued processing and storage are required by law (mainly because it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims) or unless you grant us extended consent.</p></div> <div><h4>  g)	Data categories</h4><p>  The category names listed below are used for specific types of data in the following sections:</p><ul>  <li>Account data:</li></ul><span>   Login/user ID and password</span><ul>  <li>Personal master data:</li></ul><span>   Forename, surname</span><ul>  <li>Contact data:</li></ul><span>   Email address(es)</span><ul>  <li>Login data:</li></ul><span>   Times and technical information on login, authentication and logout; data entered by you when logging on</span><ul>  <li>Purchase order data:</li></ul></div> <span><span>   Products ordered, prices, payment</span></span> <div><ul>  <li>Payment data:</li></ul><span>   Account information, credit card details, data for other payment services like Stripe, Street, house number, additional address lines (where applicable), postcode, city, country are solely used in connection to payments</span><ul>  <li>Newsletter and transactional email user profile data:</li></ul><span>   Opening of newsletter/email (date and time), contents, selected links, as well as the following information relating to the computer system accessing the newsletter: Internet Protocol address used (IP address), browser type, browser version, device type, operating system and similar technical information.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li>Access data:</li></ul><span>   Date and time of visit to our services; the page from which the system accessed our site (“referrer”) as well as the following information relating to the computer system accessing the service: Internet Protocol address used (IP address), browser type, browser version, device type, operating system and similar technical information.

Accessing our services</h3><p>  The passages below set out how your personal data are processed when you access our services (e.g., loading and viewing the website, opening the mobile app and navigating within the app). We would point out that it is impossible not to send access data to external content providers (cf. subsection b) due to the technical processes involved in transmitting information over the Internet. The third-party providers are themselves responsible for the privacy-compliant operation of the IT systems which they use. The service providers are required to decide how long the data will be stored.</p></div> <div><h4>  a)	Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of storage</h4><ul>  <li>Data category:

</span></div> <div><h2>  B. Details of data processing within our website</h2><p>  This section of the Privacy Policy contains detailed information about the processing of personal data in the context of our website. The information is subdivided for greater clarity into certain functions in connection with our services. Where the services are used in the normal way, different functions and therefore also different processing operations can be implemented consecutively or simultaneously.</p></div> <div><h3>  I. Newsletter subscriptions</h3><p>  Ghostery offers product news and updates as well as educational and informational updates around the topic of privacy. Just subscribe to our mailing list, and you’ll receive all the latest information about the world of Ghostery.</p><p>  If you register for one of our free newsletters, we will inform you regularly about selected new products, valuable tips, and news as well as exclusive offers. As part of the registration for the newsletter, you will receive a confirmation message containing a link to the final registration (“double opt-in procedure”). This ensures that the newsletter was ordered by you and not by a third party. When registering, your data is first stored on our servers, or the servers of the service providers used and a confirmation message with a link to the final registration is generated to the e-mail address provided. If you do not confirm the registration by clicking on the link in this e-mail, the data will be deleted. Only by confirming the link your data will be finally stored for the purpose of sending the newsletter. If you no longer agree to the storage of your data for this purpose and therefore no longer wish to use our service, you can unsubscribe from our newsletters at any time. For this purpose, you will find a corresponding link in each newsletter.</p></div> <p><p>  We would like to point out that your interactions with the newsletter are measured (“opening and click behaviour”). For this measurement, the emails sent contain tracking pixels or corresponding links that can measure the opening and click rates within the newsletter for the purpose of optimising our newsletters. This data is not linked to other data or used to create user profiles.</p></p> <div><h4>  a) Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of storage</h4><ul>  <li>Data category:

This is regularly the case upon receipt of your withdrawal. In the event of your withdrawal, however, we reserve the right to store your e-mail address for the purpose of proving that you have previously given your consent. This storage is solely for the purpose of defending possible legal claims.

Country detection</h3><p>  For providing localized content and reporting telemetry, the Ghostery website needs to know the approximate region from which the browser connects to the internet. Ghostery requires only very basic information on the region, namely the country. No other detailed information like state or city are ever inferred. To detect it, Ghostery uses two methods: 1. The mapping of IP address to a country; 2. Content Delivery Network’s edge location which is the country of the closest data center.</p></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI. Accessing our services</span></span> <span><span>  . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party.</span></span> <div><h3>  XI. Use of Cookies</h3><p>  For the purpose of operating the website, we use absolutely necessary (“technically necessary”) cookies. We would like to inform you about the cookies used in the following:</p><span>  Name of the Cookie</span><span>  Purpose</span><span>  Storage period</span><td>  user_id</td><td>  Creating a User ID</td><td>  7 days</td><td>  refresh_token</td><td>  Authentication</td><td>  7 days</td><td>  access_token</td><td>  Authentication</td><td>  1 hour</td><td>  __stripe_sid</td></div> <div><td>  Processing payment transactions</td><td>  30 minutes</td><td>  __stripe_mid</td><td>  Processing payment transactions</td><td>  0 minutes</td><td>  ctry</td><td>  Country detection</td><td>  Session</td></div> <div><h2>  C. Details of data processing within Ghostery Browser Extensions</h2><p>  A fundamental piece of technology that started Ghostery, the Browser Extension drives our mission to improve web privacy. It’s a powerful add-on that gives users the choice to block ads and trackers, and to improve the browsing experience by hiding annoyances such as cookie notices and distracting banners or popups. Ghostery can either notify users about trackers it finds or silently block them in the background, so you don’t have to worry about them.</p></div> <p><p>  By design, the Ghostery Browser Extension ensures that all data it processes has strictly non-personal character. Because tracking protection and ad blocking requires us to understand the browser network traffic, we detach and discard any personal identifiers from the shared information that is required to provide the extension features.</p></p> <p><p>  Information on the processing of your personal data within the Ghostery Browser Extension for the purposes of Creating a User Account, Paid-for-services, Support as well as for Submitting a tracker can already be found in section B. of this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <div><h3>  I. Telemetry</h3><p>  To get basic insights on the health of the Ghostery Browser Extension a very simple information snippet about the extension installation is sent to Ghostery daily. This information is strictly non-personal, it covers a general overview of the extension settings, like whenever or not tracking protection or ad blocking are enabled. Furthermore, basic information about the browser Ghostery runs in is collected as well as the operating system, language and country from which it is being used. Extra telemetry is sent if users opt-in to additional telemetry, helping Ghostery understand which product features are commonly used and facilitating future development and improvements of the Ghostery Browser Extension.</p></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI. Accessing our services</span></span> <span><span>  . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party.</span></span> <div><h3>  II. Customer Messaging Platform</h3><p>  For the purpose of reaching out to certain groups of users, the Customer Messaging Platform distributes marketing messaging to all Ghostery Browser Extension users. The individual Ghostery Browser Extension sends strictly non-personal information to the Ghostery Customer Messaging Platform servers. This information is very basic like browser type, extension version or language of the browser. In this messaging model, Ghostery does not know which exact users get the particular message and is unable to target individuals.</p></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI. Accessing our services</span></span> <span><span>  . No other personal data is ever shared with a third party.</span></span> <div><h3>  III. Block list updates</h3><p>  Multiple Ghostery Browser Extension features rely on regular data updates for best coverage. E.g. the ad blocker and anti-tracking features integrated in the Ghostery Browser Extension get daily updates.</p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p><span>  VI.

All users accepting the Ghostery Privacy Policy report information on online tracking and non-private search engines to </p><span>  whotracks.me</span><span>  . This way Ghostery creates a feedback loop from the user community observing the behaviour of online trackers and stopping the tracking and fingerprinting as it happens. The reported information is strictly related to the observed parties and never includes information about the observer (the user). All communication is encrypted end-to-end. In addition a protocol is used to ensure anonymity on a network layer, by making every individual message look like as coming from a different browser. No two messages can be linked.</span></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI. Accessing our services</span></span> <span><span>  . No personal data is ever shared with a third party.</span></span> <div><h3>  V. Phishing and Malware protection</h3><p>  One of Ghostery features is Phishing and Malware protection which requires Ghostery Browser Extension to test every visited url against a large list of potentially harmful domains. As this domain list is extremely large and frequently changed, shipping it with the extension is not feasible. To be able to provide this type of protection and ensure users’ privacy, the Ghostery Browser Extension never shares a full url with the Ghostery backend but sends a checksum (technically half of it) only, being sufficient for checking if the domain is on the block list but insufficient to tell which page it exactly is.</p></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI.

User Account Session refresh</h3><p>  For providing premium features the Ghostery Browser Extension relies on the </p><span>  ghostery.com</span><span>   login session. Once logged in via extension or Ghostery website, the user session will automatically refresh as long as the browser is open. The session will be destroyed once a user logs out from the website or the Ghostery Browser Extension.</span></div> <div><h4>  a) Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of stor</h4><span>  age</span><ul>  <li>Data category:

Country detection</h3><p>  For providing features like country-based ad blocking and reporting telemetry, the Ghostery Browser Extension needs to know the approximate region from which the browser connects to the internet. Ghostery requires only very basic information on the region, namely the country. No other detailed information like state or city are ever inferred. To detect it, Ghostery uses two methods: 1. The mapping of IP address to a country; 2. Content Delivery Network’s edge location which is the country of the closest data center by which the Ghostery Browser Extension is able to reach.</p></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI.

Setting Synchronization</h3><p>  Logged in Ghostery premium users have their settings automatically synchronised across all browsers with Ghostery Browser Extension installed. Those settings are stored on the Ghostery servers. The information about the settings synchronisation is never logged or processed by Ghostery in other way but to provide the Synchronisation feature.</p></div> <div><h4>  a) Purposes of data processing, legal basis, legitimate interests (where applicable), and period of storage</h4><ul>  <li>Data category:

The individual Ghostery Browser Extension sends strictly non-personal information to Ghostery A/B test servers. This information is very basic like browser type, country, extension version or operating system. Ghostery never gets any reports on which exact users are participating in a specific A/B test and A/B test information is never connected to the Ghostery account. Ghostery users can opt out of this functionality in Ghostery control panel.</p></div> <p><p>  For the purpose of this activity we process Access Data only, as defined in </p></p> <span><span>  VI.
