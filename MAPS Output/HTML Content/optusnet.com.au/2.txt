</h2><p>  <b> 1. Do I have to delete the old version before upgrading to the new
version? </b>
</p><p>  A. No, you do not have to delete or uninstall the old version before
upgrading. Simply install it, no fiddling around, no need to close open programs
(except Nojoks itself!), no rebooting of your computer and no replacing of
system files! Minimum hassle installation!
</p><p>   
</p><p>  <b> 2. Does any version expire after a certain date? </b>
</p><p>  A. No, the versions that can be downloaded from this web-site NEVER expire.
You can continue using the version you have on your hard-drive for as long as
you like.

</p><p>  <b> 3. Do I have to send personal information in the
registration? </b>
</p><p>  A. No you do not. If you would like to register without submitting your
personal user name, e-mail us the details and delete your name and let us know
that you do not want to submit your user name for privacy reasons. After we can
confirm your host status, you can obtain a number. This process may take a
little longer than a normal registration. Please be patient.
</p><td>  <b> 4. How long does a registration acceptance normally
take? </b>
</td></div> <p><p>  A. Normally up to two days. Sometimes due to unusual circumstances, it could
take up to a week, but we try to be as quick as possible. You will always
receive a reply within a week.
</p></p> <div><p>   
</p><p>  <b> 5. There are no formats after I install it. Where are they? </b>
</p><p>  A. Currently, we do not have a list of standard formats for all the rooms to
install with the bracket. But you can either download a format from <a href="http://communities.msn.com/NojoksTourneyBracket/tourneyformats.msnw" target="_blank"> here </a>
or create you own! Click <a href="howtouse2.htm" target="_blank"> here </a> for

</p><p>  <a href="" target="_blank"> Q13 </a><b> . I'm holding a double-elim tournament and a loser in the winner's
bracket leaves before playing in the loser's bracket. Can I remove the player
from the tournament? </b>

player </i> in the menu. This will readjust all the tables and byes to accommodate

</p><p>  <a href="" target="_blank"> Q15 </a><b> . Can I insert delays into my macros? </b>
</p><p>  A. Yes, you can. To insert a delay, enter   <font> .<DELAY:##.##> </font> 
on its own line (it will not work if it part of a line of text), where ##.## is
the time in seconds. For example, <font> .<DELAY:05.00> </font>
will pause 5 seconds before continuing with the macro.
</p><p>   
</p><p>  <a href="" target="_blank"> Q16 </a><b> . I have added or edited a format or macro but it does not save. How do I
save it? </b>
</p></div> <p><p>  A. Make sure you click on the OK button to close the manager. This will
automatically save any changes you have done. Clicking on Cancel or the little X
in the top-right corner of the box will not save the changes. If you cannot see
the OK button, you may have to change your display properties to use "small
fonts" instead of the "large" fonts. This will hopefully be fixed
up in a future version.
</p></p> <div><p>   
</p><p>  <a href="" target="_blank"> Q17 </a><b> . What do the version numbers mean? </b>
</p><p>  A. The first number is the "major version" number - this is one and
will be so for quite a while. The second number is the "minor version"
number, and this is usually incremented with a major new feature being
introduced (ie. prior to triple-elim, the version was 1.0, and with triple-elim,
became 1.1). The third number is the "release" number. This is
incremented everytime a version is released with any new functionality. The last
number is the "build" number. This is incremented everytime a new
version is sent out, including bug fixes, and also includes releases to a few
people experiencing problems that can test it for me before release.
</p></div> <div><p>   
</p><p>  <a href="" target="_blank"> Q18 </a><b> . Is this written in VB (Visual Basic)? </b>
</p><p>  A. No, it is not written in VB or any other Microsoft product. Of course the
next question from some of the tech-heads out there is what is it written in? It
is written in Borland's Delphi (Object Oriented Pascal), and yes, the
author uses C and C++ for his day-to-day job!
