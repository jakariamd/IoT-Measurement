            in the business of selling our customer’s personal information to others. We share
            customer’s personal information only as described below:</p><ul>  <li><strong>  Our joint use: </strong> We jointly use your personal information for such purposes as described in this Privacy
                  Notice, with domestic and foreign affiliates that Amazon.com, Inc., controls, including

                  from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                  providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                  When you place an order from a third party, information related to the order will
                  be provided to such third-party seller, including to sellers located outside of Japan,
                  and such information will be subject to the third-party seller’s privacy policy. Foreign
                  sellers who sell products on Amazon.co.jp are required to commit to Amazon that they
                  adopt measures to protect personal information. You can see more information about
                  a third-party seller on that seller’s information page.

                     to the card’s issuer for fraud detection and prevention purposes. While the card issuer
                     might be located abroad, Amazon is unable to know their location in advance.
</p></p> <p><p>  Please see <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GV6CERSBJCDKYU96" target="_blank"> here </a> for information on data privacy laws and protection in foreign countries where third
                     parties may be located.
</p></p> <p><p>  We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                     such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
                     transactions, and we share customer’s personal information related to those transactions
                     with that third party.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Third-Party Service Providers </strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                  include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal
                  mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
                  providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                  listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing
                  and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service
                  providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
                  may not use it for other purposes.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Business Transfers </strong> As we continue to develop our business, Amazon might sell or buy other businesses
                  or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
                  business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                  Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely
                  event that Amazon or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
                  will of course be one of the transferred assets. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Protection of Amazon and Others </strong> We release account and other personal information when we determine release is appropriate
                  to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000" target="_blank"> Conditions of Use </a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users,
                  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                  for fraud protection, piracy protection and credit risk reduction. This also includes
                  sharing safety-related information about products we sell, such as side effects of
                  pharmaceuticals, to manufacturers and others as required by law.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>   Other than as set out above, you will receive a notice when personal information
            about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to
            choose not to share the information. </p></p> <div><h2>  Collection of Personally Referable Information</h2><p>  Amazon may receive Personally Referable Information and acquire it as personal data,

                  interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                  third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909150" target="_blank"> Interest Based Ads Notice </a>.

                  useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
                  your name or other information that identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use
                  an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from
                  applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address. For
                  example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                  identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                  the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads
                  from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based
                  advertising by going to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/adprefs" target="_blank"> Advertising Preferences </a> page.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  What Information Can I Access?</h2><p>  You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile

                  notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Because
                  cookies and identifiers allow you to take advantage of some essential features of
