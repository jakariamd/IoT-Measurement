If you access other digital properties of the Walt Disney Family of Companies, you will need to make your election for each. Also, if you clear your cookies on this browser or use another browser or device, you may need to opt out again on this property.  In addition to the above toggle, you may choose to provide the information requested in this <a href="https://usprivacy.disney.com/dnssmpi" target="_blank"> opt-out form </a>, which may enable us to take action on your opt-out election more broadly than just on this digital property. You may also choose to enable online, where available, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt-out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). We will process the GPC signal as a request to opt out. If you opt out, you may continue to see advertising, including ads that may be based on personal information processed before you opted out. You also may have rights to opt out from certain third parties selling and sharing your personal information. You will need to separately exercise your opt-out rights with regard to each, which you may do through this <a href="https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html" target="_blank"> IAB opt-out list </a>. You may also wish to use other available online tools to limit various types of interest-based advertising or tracking.
