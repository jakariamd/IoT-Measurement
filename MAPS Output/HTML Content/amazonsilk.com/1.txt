            in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share
            customers' personal information only as described below and with subsidiaries Amazon.com,
            Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
            least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Transactions involving Third Parties: </strong> We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by
                  third parties for use on or through Amazon Services. For example, you can order products
                  from third parties through our stores, download applications from third-party application
                  providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services.
                  We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses,
                  such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your
                  transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions
                  with that third party.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Third-Party Service Providers: </strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                  include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal
                  mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data,
                  providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid
                  listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing
                  and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service
                  providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but
                  may not use it for other purposes.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Business Transfers:  </strong>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services.
                  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                  assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice
                  (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event
                  that Amazon.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information
                  will of course be one of the transferred assets.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Protection of Amazon and Others: </strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate
                  to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM" target="_blank"> Conditions of Use </a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users,
                  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations
                  for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about
            you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose
            not to share the information.</p></p> <div><h2>   How Secure Is Information About Me? </h2><p>  We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p><ul>  <li>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by
                  using encryption protocols and software. </li><li>We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling
                  credit card data. </li><li>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the
                  collection, storage, and disclosure of customer personal information. Our security
                  procedures mean that we may ask to verify your identity before we disclose personal
                  information to you.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Our devices offer security features to protect them against unauthorized access and

                  apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you
                  interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about
                  third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our </li></ul></div> <span><span>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ibanotice" target="_blank"> Interest-Based Ads </a> notice. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacyprefs?ref_=footer_iba" target="_blank"> Your Ads Privacy Choices </a> page.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: </strong> We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more
                  useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share
                  your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead,
                  we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived
                  from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
                  For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
                  identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download
                  the app again. While we do not share your specific shopping actions like purchases,
                  product views, or searches with ad companies, we may share an advertising identifier
                  and an estimate of the value of the ads they show you on our behalf so they can serve
                  you with more effective Amazon ads. Some ad companies also use this information to
                  serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out
                  of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going
