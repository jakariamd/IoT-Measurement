</p></div> <p><p>  <u> Timing of Claims: </u> Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to, or arising out of, these Terms of Service, this System or your use of this System (including, but not limited to, the purchase of products) must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. You acknowledge and agree that any claim or cause of action not commenced within one (1) year is permanently barred.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Arbitration and Venue: </u> In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this these Terms of Use, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination or breach thereof, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. If they do not reach a satisfactory solution within a period of sixty (60) days, then, upon notice by any party to the other(s), any unresolved controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“<strong> ICDR </strong>”) (<a href="http://www.icdr.org/" target="_blank"> www.icdr.org </a>) in accordance with the provisions of its International Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be in New York City, New York, U.S.A. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.

</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Final Arbitration: </u> The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Neither party may use, disclose, or divulge any such information unless otherwise required by law.
</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Class Action Waiver: </u><strong>  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms of Service shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms of Service, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST ANOTHER PARTY IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one (1) person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction. </strong>
</p></p> <div><h3>  Exclusions
</h3><p>  Some jurisdictions, such as the State of New Jersey, do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, in certain jurisdictions, some of the above provisions may not apply to you; all other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.
</p></div> <div><h3>  Miscellaneous
</h3><p>  Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these Terms of Service. We may assign our rights and duties under these Terms of Service to any party at any time without notice to you and without your express consent. You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under these Terms of Service without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section is null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of your obligations under these Terms of Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be held unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. These Terms of Service, together with our <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a>, constitute the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes in their entirety any and all written or oral agreements previously existing between the parties with respect to such subject matter.
