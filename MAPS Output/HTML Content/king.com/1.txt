To exercise this right, please visit our Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information webpage or contact us at https://soporto.king.com/contact;.  Your right to limit our use of such personal data is subject to exception. In some states, we will be required to obtain your consent before collecting your sensitive personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  Under the laws of some states, consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of personal data or the sharing of their personal data with third parties for targeted advertising (also known as cross-context behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising).</p></p> <p><p>  We share certain information with third parties who do work on our behalf for the business purposes we describe above. </p></p> <p><p>  We also will allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins.  These advertising entities use information they collect to help us provide more relevant advertisements and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.  You can control the sharing of your personal  data for targeted advertising through our websites and apps in the following ways:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To set up cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, including third-party advertising cookies, by clicking <a href="" target="_blank"> here </a>. </li><li>You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for interest-based advertising purposes.  </li><li>You also can opt-out through the in-app Privacy and Security section, in the King mobile applications, once you opt out, we record your preferences.

We will take steps to both verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.</p></p> <p><p>  Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we will provide you information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not engage in “profiling” in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects.</p></p> <p><p>  We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights, unless allowed under applicable law.</p></p> <p><p>  Some state laws allow residents who are not satisfied with our response to their requests to appeal our decision by contacting us as described in the written notice we will provide to you.</p></p> <div><h3>  Additional Privacy Information for California Residents</h3><p>  Depending on how you interact with us, King will collect the following categories of personal data about you.

As discussed above, we share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and service of interest to you and in the other ways described above.
