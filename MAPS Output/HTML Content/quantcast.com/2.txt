Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, “ <strong> Clients </strong>”) understand and grow their audiences (the “ <strong> Solutions </strong>”). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and <a href="/privacy/key-terms/#audience" target="_blank"> Audiences </a> with the right advertising.</p></div> <p><p>  To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses <a href="/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information" target="_blank"> Personal Information </a> for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the “ <a href="#information-collection" target="_blank"> Information Collection </a>” section below, we may join or match <a href="/privacy/key-terms/#personal-information" target="_blank"> Personal Information </a> about you, which may include your <a href="/privacy/key-terms/#online-data" target="_blank"> Online Data </a> from your visits across different digital properties, like websites or mobile apps, that have implemented Quantcast <a href="/privacy/key-terms/#pixels-tags-or-sdks" target="_blank"> Pixels, Tags or SDKs </a> (which is sometimes called “tracking” in the industry) or <a href="/privacy/key-terms/#offline-data" target="_blank"> Offline Data </a> .
