<div><h1>   Your Privacy Choices</h1></div> <div><h4>  Table of Contents</h4><p>  <strong> Effective Date </strong>: April 21, 2023</p></div> <div><h2>  <strong> Opt-Out Rights </strong></h2><p>  As further described in the <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/privacy/" target="_blank"> Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy </a> and the <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/legal/privacy-website/" target="_blank"> Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy </a>, under applicable law, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal information:</p><ul>  <li>Right to object (marketing): The right to object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes at any time. </li><li>Right to object (legitimate interests): The right to object to the processing of your personal information where we process it on the basis of our legitimate interests.</li><li>Right to restrict processing: The right, in certain cases, to temporarily restrict the processing of your personal information by us, provided there are valid grounds for doing so.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Right to withdraw your consent: The right to withdraw the consent you have provided at any time, where we process your personal information on the basis of your consent.</li><li>Right to opt out of certain uses or disclosures of your personal information, including the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information and the use of your personal information for “targeted advertising” (as these terms are defined under applicable law). </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Quantcast provides the ability to exercise these rights by giving you the opt-out options described below. We offer cookie-based and cookieless opt-out methods that allow you to exercise the above-listed rights. Both of these methods are specific to the browser you are using; that means that you must opt-out separately in every browser that you use. Additionally, your device and/or app settings and features may allow you to exercise certain choices and legal rights. </p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> Cookie-Based Web Browser Opt-Out </strong></h3><p>  The opt-out below will set an opt-out cookie in your web browser. Later, when you are on other websites using this same browser profile and we see the opt-out cookie, we will know the selection you have made and will act accordingly.</p><p>  Important things to know about the cookie-based opt-out for web browsers:</p><ul>  <li>This opt-out will stop our services from collecting and using personal information linked to your browser  for interest-based advertising purposes</li><li>You will still continue to see ads after opting out, but they may be less relevant to you  </li><li>If your opt-out cookie is deleted or blocked, we will no longer be able to see your selection and you will need to set your cookie preferences again </li><li>If you use different browsers, browser profiles, or devices, you will have to opt out separately on those since we are not able to access the opt-out cookie across different browsers or devices</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>This opt-out is for web browsers, not mobile apps or video or game platforms; see <a href="#h-non-web-browser-opt-outs-mobile-devices-tvs-and-other-devices" target="_blank"> below </a> for additional details </li><li>This opt-out is also not for audience matched advertising that uses identifiers based on email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct identifiers; see <a href="#h-opt-out-of-email-based-matched-advertising" target="_blank"> below </a> for additional details</li><li>This opt-out will not unsubscribe you from Quantcast’s marketing emails; see the <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/legal/privacy-website/" target="_blank"> Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy </a> to learn more about your email marketing choices </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>This opt out will not affect your Consent Management Platform (CMP) selections. A CMP is a process, usually a pop-up, that a website/digital property uses to  assist them in managing users’  privacy preferences in relation to cookies and to help them meet their transparency obligations under data protection and privacy laws. When a user visits a website and is presented with banners, pop-ups, or sliders to manage their cookie preferences, these options are often being managed using a CMP.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  <strong> Cookieless Web Browser Opt-Out </strong></h3><p>  If you disable cookies in your browser, or use a browser that does not allow cookies, we cannot associate your opt-out  selection with cookies. Instead, we associate your opt-out  selection with a unique identifier based on your device’s IP address and other information about your device, and we will stop  collecting and using personal information from your device for interest-based advertising purposes based on the IP address-based identifier. </p></div> <p><p>  Your IP address may change over time or as you move between networks (e.g., between home and office). When your browser moves to a new IP address, it will have a new IP-based identifier. Your previous opt-out selections will not be associated with the new IP-based identifier. We will collect and use personal information for interest-based advertising purposes based on the new IP address-based identifier until you opt-out from the new IP address.  Important things to know about the cookieless opt-out for web browsers</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>This opt-out will stop our services from collecting and using personal information linked to  your web browser for interest-based advertising purposes</li><li>You will continue to still see ads after opting out, but they may be less relevant to you,  </li><li>If you use different browsers, browser profiles, or devices, you will have to opt out separately on those, since the IP address-based identifier would be different for each one </li><li>Because our opt-out is based on your device’s IP address and other information about your device, if that information changes, the identifier we use will change and an opt-out from a previous identifier will not be applied to the new IP address until you opt-out from the new IP address</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>This opt-out is for web browsers, not mobile apps or video or game platforms; see <a href="#h-non-web-browser-opt-outs-mobile-devices-tvs-and-other-devices" target="_blank"> below </a> for additional details</li><li>This opt-out is also not for audience matched advertising that uses identifiers based on email addresses, phone numbers, or other direct identifiers; see <a href="#h-opt-out-of-email-based-matched-advertising" target="_blank"> below </a> for additional details</li><li>This opt-out will not unsubscribe you from Quantcast’s marketing emails; see the <a href="/legal/privacy-website/" target="_blank"> Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy </a> to learn more about your email marketing choices  </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>This opt out will not affect your  Consent Management Platform (CMP) selections. A CMP is a process, usually a pop-up, that a website/digital property uses to  assist them in managing users’ preferences and to help them meet their transparency obligations under data protection and privacy laws. When a user visits a website and is presented with banners, pop-ups or sliders to manage their cookie preferences, these options are often being managed using a CMP.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition to the cookieless opt-out described above, in order to meet our obligations under applicable law, we follow a strict data minimization process. Specifically, we use each IP address-based identifier for a maximum of 30 days. After that time, we create a different identifier, which we do not link to the previous identifier. Data is retained with the prior identifier for up to 30 additional days for security and anti-fraud purposes. Therefore, if you wish for Quantcast to stop processing personal information it has about you in association with an IP-address based identifier, such processing will cease within 30 days for all purposes except security and anti-fraud, which will cease after 60 days. </p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Additional Web Browser Opt-Out Options </strong></p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Industry Web Browser Opt-Outs </strong></h3><p>  You may opt out of interest-based advertising from certain companies by using one or more of the following industry opt-out pages: </p><ul>  <li>in Europe: <a href="https://youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank"> https://youronlinechoices.com/ </a> </li></ul><p>  <em> Please note that the list of industry opt-out tools above is not intended to be exhaustive and there may be a different opt-out tool/consumer choice mechanism available in your country/region. Please also note that  not all companies that participate in industry opt-out options offer a cookieless opt-out option at this time. </em></p></div> <div><h3>  Global Privacy Control</h3><p>  Depending on your U.S. state or country of residence, you can also use certain preference signals to exercise your sale and sharing opt-out rights automatically with all businesses that you interact with online, including Quantcast. If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies with applicable law, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use. </p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Web Browser Opt-Outs using Consent Management Platforms </strong></h3><p>  Quantcast has integrated with IAB Europe’s TCF v2 and, where website publishers have implemented TCF-compliant Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) on their properties, users are able to manage their choices with respect  to the processing of personal information collected on the website through the CMPs on the relevant website. </p><p>  Screenshot examples of a CMP are below for illustrative purposes. A user can opt out by moving the toggle to the appropriate setting. In the first example, a user can opt out by moving the toggle to the right, in which case the toggle will indicate that the user has opted out by turning red and displaying an “x”. In the second example, the user can opt out by moving the toggle to the left, in which case the toggle will be changed to “off.”</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Non-Web Browser Opt-Outs: Mobile Devices, TVs, and Other Device </strong>s</h3><p>  Both the cookie-based and cookieless opt-out options described above work with web browsers only. Though different browsers have different privacy settings, the underlying technology is similar from one browser to the next. </p><p>  For mobile devices, TVs, streaming boxes, game consoles, etc., every manufacturer chooses their own approach; it is not standardised. Moreover, different apps on those platforms might have their own privacy settings. </p></div> <p><p>  To learn more about exercising your choices across the devices and platforms you use, see the <a href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) web page </a>, which provides some additional information (though, we are not responsible for that content). Until there is better standardization on these platforms, your most reliable source is the documentation for your device(s) and/or app(s).</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Mobile Devices </strong> </p><p>  Regarding mobile devices (e.g.,iOS or Android phones and tablets), please note the following:</p><ul>  <li>In web browsers on those devices, the browser-specific opt-out mechanisms described above apply</li><li>For mobile apps, because we are unable to set an opt-out cookie that we can access across different apps, you will need to consult your device’s settings for instructions on how to manage your privacy and advertising choices. </li></ul><p>  <strong> TVs and Other Devices </strong></p></div> <p><p>  As with mobile devices, there is not currently a standardised type of opt-out. You should check your device settings and documentation for details.</p></p> <p><p>  Additionally, particular apps on TVs or gaming devices might offer their own privacy settings. Again, check their settings and documentation for details. </p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> Opt-Out of Sharing Location Information </strong></h3><p>  Some devices, particularly mobile devices, offer specific settings that control the sharing of location information. Check your devices’ and apps’ privacy settings and documentation for details.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Opt-Out of Email-Based Matched Advertising </strong></h3><p>  Some companies, with appropriate permissions, might use your email address to create an identifier that can be matched across websites, apps, and devices and used for interest-based advertising purposes. </p><p>  The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) has a web-based tool (available <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/optout/email" target="_blank"> here </a>) that allows users to opt out of participating members’ use of their email addresses for advertising purposes.</p></div> <div><h2>  <strong> Additional Data Subject Rights </strong></h2><p>  Depending on your U.S. state or country of residence, you may have the right to exercise additional privacy choices and legal rights with respect to your personal information under applicable law, as described below.
