We are contractually required to only process data as directed by our Clients and for no other purpose. The Platform provides our Clients with the ability to collect information based on User interaction with their mobile application(s), mobile website(s) or other digital properties where Clients have integrated with the Platform (collectively, “Client Digital Properties”) and send communications to such Users. Some information is automatically collected from or about Users when they visit or use Client Digital Properties. The types of information collected via Client Digital Properties for the Platform may include: the date/time for a visit to a Client Digital Property, referrer information such as what search engine and search keywords Users may have used to get to a Client Digital Property, information about the browser or device your User is on such as their Operating System, as well as the city/country location of Users, and any pseudonymous tokens and mobile advertising IDs (e.g., AAID in the Android o/s). In addition, our Clients can choose what other User data they want to collect and store on the Platform such as an IP address, precise location information such as lat/long, a User’s age, user names, real names, email addresses and other custom data points as determined by each Client. Each Client determines whether we transfer data off of the Platform and what specific data points are transferred.</p></div> <p><p>  Our standard practice is to prohibit Clients from placing onto the Platform sensitive information (e.g., passwords, authentication credentials, credit cards, social security or driver’s license numbers), special categories of data as defined under applicable data protection laws or information that is deemed sensitive by applicable law or self-regulatory codes. mParticle functions strictly as the data processing agent of our Clients. As a data processor and agent of our Clients, mParticle processes data via the Platform as directed by our clients and for no other purposes. Accordingly, other than those aforementioned restrictions, the data stored on the Platform is subject to the privacy policies of each Client.</p></p> <div><h2>  Disclosure of your details to third parties</h2></div> <div><h3>  Sharing of information, onward transfer</h3><p>  There are certain circumstances under which we may disclose your information to third parties. These are as follows:</p><p>  We may share your information with certain third-parties as specified below:</p><ul>  <li>With third-party agents / Vendors who work on our behalf as <a href="https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/approved-subcontractors/" target="_blank"> sub-processors </a>, provided such third parties agree to adhere to the same privacy principles as mParticle;</li><li>With Partners, such as companies that we think offer complementary services as mParticle provided such Partners agree to adhere to the same privacy principles as mParticle (e.g., marketing events at industry trade shows) where we have your permission. </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Our Clients may request that we send their data to integration partners – some of which may be found at <a href="https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/" target="_blank"> https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/ </a>.

Similarly, we do not sell identifiable personal data (e.g., email, telephone number) collected via the Sites or pursuant to our sales and marketing activities. However, our marketing team may co-promote events with other companies that may involve the sharing of attendee lists. The sharing of those attendee lists across companies may constitute a sale. Moreover, we enable third-parties operating on our Sites to place pixels that collect pseudonymous data from visitors to our Sites and which may be deemed a sale of personal information in California and other places. This pseudonymous data includes pseudonymous IDs, IP addresses and similar information and is used for marketing and advertising purposes. We provide a notice of these practices when you first visit our site and provide the appropriate choice mechanism as required by law. You may control the use of cookies via your browser settings. You may also opt-out from the sale or sharing of this information by mParticle as described in the Cookie Policy. </p></p> <div><h2>  Security of your information</h2><p>  We take reasonable steps to help protect your information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p><p>  We have put in place appropriate safeguards (both in terms of our procedures and the technology we use) to keep your information as secure as possible.

However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p></p> <div><p>  Please also note the following:</p></div> <div><h3>  No fee usually required</h3><p>  You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
