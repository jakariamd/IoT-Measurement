Sonic offers a free VPN for customers!</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cover your webcams </strong> to prevent cybercriminals from spying.</li><li><strong> Change up your browser, </strong> and your search engine while you’re at it! Tor, Firefox, and DuckDuckGo are all lauded for their privacy features.</li><li><strong> Check your social privacy settings. </strong> You can decide who you want to share your data with: your close friends, the entire world, or no one at all. Also, be mindful of what information you share on social. Once it’s up, it’s on the internet forever!</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Avoid public storage. </strong> Although it’s convenient, if you rely on storage platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox to house and share sensitive information, you’re taking a calculated risk.</li><li><strong> Another breach in the news again? </strong> How do you know if YOUR data has been compromised? Check out: <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank"> haveibeenpwned.com </a> to find out.</li><li><strong> Use software you trust. </strong> Make sure the source of your new software is above board before installing it on your computer or phone — and make sure you understand what it’s really doing.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Read (or at least skim) the terms of service. </strong> Websites and apps are required to gain user consent to collect your information and store it, so be aware of what you’re agreeing to.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  How does Sonic protect the privacy of lawful customers? CEO Dane Jasper shares his values.</p></p> <div><h2>  Our Policy</h2><p>  <a href="https://help.sonic.com/hc/en-us/articles/235963988-Sonic-net-Policies" target="_blank"> Our privacy and acceptable use policies </a> can be found in our knowledge base. Here are some specific policy points we’d like to call out:</p><ul>  <li>Sonic never sells our member information or usage data, nor do we voluntarily provide government or law enforcement with access to any data about users for surveillance purposes.</li><li>Sonic minimizes data retention, keeping data from 0–14 days for dynamic IP addresses and other logs and commits to EFF’s privacy-friendly Do Not Track policy. We believe that user data should not be retained longer than necessary, and that users deserve to have a clear understanding of personal data held by service providers.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Sonic is also against the re-authorization of Section 702 (the law behind the PRISM and Upstream programs). Governments and other entities should not collect huge quantities of phone, email or other internet usage data directly from the physical infrastructure of any communications provider.</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Footer</h2></div> <div><h3>  Residential</h3></div> <div><h3>  Business</h3></div> <div><h3>  About Us</h3></div> <div><h3>  Support</h3></div> <div><h3>  Join the community</h3><span>  2023</span><p>  Sonic uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website.
