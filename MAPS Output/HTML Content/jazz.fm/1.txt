<div><h1>  Privacy Policy</h1><p>  JAZZ.FM91 strives for transparency and trust when it comes to protecting your privacy, and we aim to clearly explain how we collect and process your information. It’s important to us that you should enjoy using our products, services and website(s) without compromising your privacy in any way. This policy outlines how we collect and use different types of personal and behavioural information, and the reasons for doing so.</p></div> <div><h2>  1. What personal data we collect and why we collect it </h2><p>  JAZZ.FM91 collects the personal data of its community members who donate online. Typically this includes name, address and phone number, and email address where applicable. Our online donations are collected and processed through Blackbaud Merchant Services (BBMS) via their database management platform Raiser's Edge. Blackbaud's services are used by most of the major charities in North America and are industry leaders in ensuring the highest level of security for everyone using their services. For more information on Blackbaud's privacy policies, please click <a href="https://www.blackbaud.ca/company/privacy-policy/canada" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  If you donated to JAZZ.FM91 online and/or set up a perpetual monthly donation between September, 2018, and March, 2020,  you will have used Stripe, our previous merchant service. A small number of donors continue to have their donations processed through this service as we make the final transition. Please be aware that this change was made not due to any concern about Stripe but to better integrate our payment and database management systems and to make the donor experience more seamless. You can read about Stripe's privacy policy <a href="https://stripe.com/ca/privacy" target="_blank"> here </a>. </p></p> <p><p>  We use your personal information to establish and maintain communication with you. This includes soliciting donations, providing you with tax receipts, participating in contests and keeping you up to date on our current activities via printed and online newsletters. </p></p> <p><p>  If you have participated in an online activity, your personal information will only be used for the purposes of that online activity, unless you otherwise provide us with your consent. We may ask for your permission to use your personal information for other purposes, for example, to send you a newsletter or donor solicitation. We will only use this information for these purposes if you have provided us with consent by "opting in" on the online form. </p></p> <p><p>  If you have entered and won one of our contests, your name, photograph, and city of residence may be published by us and/or our sponsors. Please check the specific contest rules for details. </p></p> <div><h2>  2. Cookies </h2><p>  JAZZ.FM91 uses cookies to make your user experience simpler.
