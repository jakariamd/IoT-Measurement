<div><h1>  Buzzsprout - Privacy Policy</h1><p>  Higher Pixels, dba Buzzsprout, provides the Buzzsprout product (www.buzzsprout.com) and Buzzsprout Ads (www.buzzsprout.com/ads), together referred to as the Buzzsprout Services. Buzzsprout is committed to protecting the privacy and data of those who visit the buzzsprout.com website, use the Buzzsprout Services, and listen to podcast episodes served from Buzzsprout servers.</p><p>  The data you put into Buzzsprout is yours. We‚Äôll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or fix a software issue. We log access to accounts by IP address. This allows us to verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Podcast Listener Privacy </strong></p><p>  Buzzsprout believes protecting online privacy is important and that extends to podcast listeners. When you listen to a podcast served directly from Buzzsprout's servers, you can be assured your privacy is being respected. Buzzsprout only collects the minimum data necessary to validate a download, understand the application that was used to initiate the download, and get a general sense of where in the world that download was delivered.</p><p>  Buzzsprout does NOT use listener data to:
          </p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Programmatically target advertisements</li><li>Track and/or identify individuals</li><li>Create interest-based profiles</li><li>Combine data pools to associate audience demographics</li><li>Sell listener data to anyone for any purpose</li></ul><p>  <strong> What data does Buzzsprout collect from listeners on third-party distribution channels? </strong></p><p>  When a podcast episode is downloaded through any third-party distribution channel, listener data is recorded for analysis.</p><ul>  <li>IP Address</li><li>User Agent</li><li>Referring URL (in some cases)</li></ul></div> <p><p>  The data above is retrieved directly from server logs.
