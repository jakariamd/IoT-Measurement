This means that AppLovin does not collect social security numbers, drivers’ licenses, financial account or credit card numbers (except as provided by our business customers to us for payment processing purposes), precise geolocation, racial and ethnic characteristics, religious and philosophical beliefs, union membership, the contents of messages (mail, email, or text), mental or physical

</strong></h2><p>  AppLovin does not “sell” information as most people would commonly understand that term or in the way that the Applicable Laws primarily define the term “sale.”  The Applicable Laws define a “sale” as a disclosure of personal information to third parties for “monetary” and/or “other valuable consideration.”  AppLovin does not, and will not, disclose your personal information in direct exchange for money or some other form of payment.  </p></div> <p><p>  AppLovin may “share” personal information about you for purposes of serving you with personalized ads or content, otherwise known as “interest-based advertising” or “cross-context behavioral advertising.”  Certain of the Applicable Laws define “sharing” as “communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information” to “a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for money or other valuable consideration.”  In other words, AppLovin may share your personal information with a third party to help serve you with personalized content or ads that may be more relevant to your interests, and to perform other advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.  </p></p> <p><p>  The chart included above sets forth the categories of third parties with whom we have “shared” personal information within the
