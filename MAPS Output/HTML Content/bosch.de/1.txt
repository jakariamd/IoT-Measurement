                        person, for example,
                        names, addresses, telephone numbers or e-mail addresses which are the expression of the identity
                        of a person. We
                        process personal data only when there is a statutory legal basis for doing so or if you have
                        given us your consent,
                        e.g. in the scope of a registration.</p></p> <p><p>  3.3 Processing purposes and legal bases</p></p> <div><p>  Our delegated service providers and we process your personal data for the following

                        Internet browser and
                        stored by us in so-called "log-files".</p></p> <p><p>  We save the log files for the determination of malfunction and for safety reasons (e.g. for the
                        investigation of
                        attempted attacks) for a short period and delete them afterwards. If a further retention of log
                        files is required
                        for evidence purposes, these will be exempted from deletion until the final clarification of the
                        respective incident
                        and can be handed over to investigating authorities in individual cases.</p></p> <p><p>  The following information, in particular, is stored in the log files:</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>IP address (Internet protocol address) of the end device from which the online offer is
                                accessed;

                                player);
</li><li>http status code (e.g. "Inquiry successful" or "Requested file not found").
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  3.5 Transfer of data</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3.5.1 Transfer of data to other responsible parties  </em></p></p> <p><p>  We will principally only transfer your personal data to other responsible parties insofar as if
                        this is necessary for
                        the contract performance, we or the third party has a predominantly justified interest in the
                        transfer or if you
                        have given your consent. You will find details concerning the legal bases in section "Processing
                        purposes and legal
                        bases" (see no. 3.3). Third parties can also be other companies in the Bosch Group. It will be
                        explained in this
                        data protection policy if data are transferred on the basis of a predominantly justified
                        concern.</p></p> <p><p>  Moreover, data can also be transferred to other responsible parties, insofar as we are obligated
                        to do this on the
                        basis of statutory regulations or due to enforceable official or judicial order.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3.5.2 Transfer of data to service providers  </em></p></p> <p><p>  We assign tasks such as marketing services, programming and data hosting to external service
                        providers. We have
                        selected these service providers with utmost care and monitor them on a regular basis, in
                        particular with regard to
                        their diligent handling and protection of the data stored by them. All providers are bound to
                        confidentiality and
                        adherence to the legal specifications by us. Service providers can also be other companies in
                        the Bosch Group.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3.5.3 Transfer to recipients outside the EEA  </em></p></p> <p><p>  We can also transfer personal data to recipients with headquarters outside the EEA in so-called
                        non-member countries.
                        In this case, we ensure before transfer that the recipient either possesses an appropriate
                        standard of data
                        protection (e.g. on the basis of an adequacy decision of the EU Commission for the relevant
                        country or the agreement
                        of so-called EU standard contractual causes of the European Union with the recipient) or if you
                        have consented to
                        the transfer. You can obtain an overview of the recipients in non-member countries and a copy of
                        the specifically
                        agreed regulations to guarantee the appropriate standard of data protection from us. Please use
                        the information
                        contained in section "Responsible authority and contact"¬ù <em> (see no. 2) </em>.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> 3.6 Duration of storage; retention periods  </em></p></p> <p><p>  On principle, we store your data for as long as it takes for the provision of our online offer
                        and the associated
                        services or when we have a justified interest in further storage (e.g. after the fulfilment of a
                        contract, we could
                        still have a justified interest in postal marketing). In all other cases, we will delete your
                        personal data with the
                        exception of such data that we are obliged to retain for the fulfilment of legal obligations
                        (e.g. as a result of
                        fiscal and commercial retention periods, we are obliged to retain documents such as contracts
                        and invoices for a
                        specific period of time).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4. External links  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Our online offer can contain links to the websites of third parties and to providers who are not
                        affiliated with us.
                        After you click the link, we no longer have any influence on the collection, processing and
                        utilization of any
                        personal data that is transferred to third parties after clicking the link (for example, the IP
                        address or the URL
                        of the site on which the link is located), as our control of the conduct of third parties is
                        then naturally
                        withdrawn. We assume no responsibility for the processing of this kind of personal data by third
                        parties.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5. Security  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Our staff and our delegated service provider companies are obliged to maintain secrecy and to
                        adhere to the
                        regulations of the applicable data protection laws.</p></p> <p><p>  We take all necessary technical and organizational measures in order to ensure an appropriate
                        standard of protection
                        and to protect your data that are administered by us especially from the risks of unintentional
                        or unlawful
                        destruction, manipulation, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access.
                        Our security measures
                        are continually improved according to the technological development.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6. Your rights  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Please use the information contained in section "Data controller and contact"(see no. 2) to

                        invoicing or accounting
                        purposes or are subject to the statutory retention obligation. Insofar as the access to such
                        data is not required,
                        the processing thereof will be restricted (see below).</p></p> <p><p>  6.3 Restriction of processing:</p></p> <p><p>  You can demand from us the restriction of the processing of your data insofar as the legal
                        prerequisites are
                        fulfilled.</p></p> <p><p>  6.4 Data portability:</p></p> <p><p>  You will continue to have the right to obtain data that you have provided to us transmitted in a
                        structured,
                        conventional and machine-readable form or as far as this is technically feasible, to demand that
                        the data are
                        transmitted to a third party.</p></p> <p><p>  6.5 Right to appeal to the supervisory authority</p></p> <p><p>  You have the right to submit an appeal to a data protection supervisory authority. For this
                        purpose, you can refer to
                        the data protection supervisory authority, which is competent for your place of residence of
                        federal state or to the
                        data protection supervisory authority which is competent for our group. The data protection
                        supervisory authority
                        responsible for us is the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of

                        as this is necessary
                        due to the technical development. In these cases, we will also adapt our data protection policy
                        accordingly.
