</div></div> <div><h3>  <a href="" target="_blank"> 6.2 </a> Fees
</h3><div>  In consideration of being granted access to the Service, you agree to pay any fees advised to you prior to you becoming bound by this agreement, or agreed to be paid from time to time.  
</div><div>  Any such fees need to be paid by you within thirty (30) days of us issuing an invoice to you. 
</div><div>  If we ask you to pay those fees to a third party, then payment to that third party will be as good as payment being made to us. 
</div></div> <div><div>  You must also pay us any GST imposed on the fees you are required to pay under this agreement at the same time as you pay the relevant fee. In return we will provide you with a valid tax invoice for that payment. 
</div></div> <div><div>  If you have subscribed to the Service, either by paid subscription or trial subscription, your subscription will be automatically renewed to ensure continuity. If you do not wish to renew your subscription you must advise us in writing prior to the last business day of the renewal month.  
</div></div> <div><h3>  <a href="" target="_blank"> 6.3 </a> Change in fees
</h3><div>  Unfortunately, it is necessary for us to review our fees and to increase them from time to time. If we need to increase our fees for any reason we will provide you with written notice of the change in the fees. 
</div><div>  We understand that an increase in fees impacts on your operation and because of this we will not ask you to pay any increased amount until twenty eight (28) days after we advise you of the proposed increase. 
</div></div> <div><div>  After that period the new fees will apply to your use of the Service/Website. 
</div></div> <div><h3>  <a href="" target="_blank"> 6.4 </a> Failure to pay
</h3><div>  If you do not pay fees we ask you to pay to use the Service and/or access the Website by the time we ask you to pay them then we will issue you with a reminder notice and give you a further seven (7) days to pay. If we issue you a reminder notice we can also require that you pay to us a late payment fee equal to two percent (2%) of the amount outstanding for each reminder that we send to you. 
</div><div>  If you still do not pay the full amount owing, including any late payment fees we ask you to pay, we can suspend your right to use the Service/Website until all of those fees are paid. If we suspend your right to use the Service/Website we can require you to pay a further fee to meet the additional costs incurred by us in having to do so. 
</div></div> <div><h3>  <a href="" target="_blank"> 6.5 </a> No claim for suspended service
</h3><div>  If we suspend your use of the Service/Website under clause 6.4 it is because you have not paid the fees you agreed to pay us and because of this you agree not to make any Claim against us for any loss or damage you incur as a result of that action.
