If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or the legitimate interests of any third-party), this interest will typically be to operate or improve our platform and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you, for security verification purposes when you contact us, to respond to your queries, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of potentially detecting or preventing illegal activities. </p></p> <p><p>  We may use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other automated decision-making to enhance your user experience and keep our site safe.</p></p> <p><p>  For example, we may use it in relation to:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>the sort order you see on our site,</li><li>destinations, property or activity recommendations,</li><li>flight price insights and alerts,</li><li>the content you upload on our site (e.g., images of your properties) to ensure they meet our quality or formatting requirements, and to identify relevant amenities included in your listing,</li><li>the reviews you share with us to ensure they do not contain identifiable personal information or to assess customer satisfaction,</li><li>the prevention and detection of breach of our terms and conditions or other fraudulent activities to keep our site safe,</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>our language and dialects within our virtual agents’ experience.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Automated decisions may be made by putting your personal information into a system and the decision is calculated using automatic processes.</p></p> <p><p>  We will not engage in automated decision-making that involves a decision with legal or similarly significant effects solely based on automated processing of personal information, unless you: (1) explicitly consented to the processing, (2) the processing is necessary for entering into a contract, or (3) when otherwise authorized by applicable law.</p></p> <p><p>  You may have rights in relation to automated decision making, including the ability to request a manual decision-making process instead or contest a decision based solely on automated processing.
