Users</h2></div> <div><h3>  2.1 Information We Collect from Users (“User Information”)</h3><p>  We automatically collect User Information when Users interact with our Services that appear on our Customers’ websites and digital properties. Like most other web-based services, we collect this User Information through cookies and other technologies. Taboola collects only pseudonymized data, which means we do not know who you are because we do not know or process your name, email address, or other identifiable data. User Information that we collect includes, but is not limited to, Information about a User’s device and operating system, IP address, the web pages accessed by Users within our Customers’ websites, the link that led a User to a Customer’s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Customers’ website, event information (e.g., system crashes), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User). In the Taboola News suite of tools, we also collect in-app User behaviors (e.g. online status, browsing activity, and clicks) and implicit non-precise device location inferred from search queries (when enabled by the User) and SIM cards or IP addresses. We ask our Customers to obtain consent on our behalf, where required by applicable data protection laws, for us to collect this User Information. We may also obtain Information about you from our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/data-partners" target="_blank"> data partners </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  For more information about how we use cookies and other technologies, please refer to our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  2.2 How We Use User Information</h3><p>  We use User Information for the following purposes:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Providing our Service </strong>.

For more information about how we tailor our content see information below about our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/privacy-policy#interest-based-advertising" target="_blank"> Interest Based Advertising </a>.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Tailoring content across multiple devices </strong>. We may use User Information to improve a unique User’s experience across multiple browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or other viewing devices) by providing better targeted ad campaigns to that User. For instance, should we recognize a User on a web browser, we may want to provide that User similar or personalized content on mobile apps, as well. To do this, we identify unique Users across devices, or we may sync cookies and identifiers with our service providers or Customers that do this, to help our Customers enhance their own data and data segments, or to help them target the right audience.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Offering our Customers data segments that help target content and advertisements for topics, products, and services that may interest you. </strong> A data segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes (e.g., travel enthusiasts). We offer a number of data segments, both proprietary and from our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/data-partners" target="_blank"> data partners </a>, to our Customers so that they may better target Users who are more likely to be interested in their content and advertisements. Taboola does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, Personal Data revealing your racial or ethnic origin or your religious affiliations, or Personal Data concerning your sensitive health information, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data). In connection with our Services, our Customers may use these <a href="https://www.taboola.com/pdf/health-related-segments/" target="_blank"> standard health-related segments </a> about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or over the counter medications. In addition, Taboola offers our Customers <a href="https://www.taboola.com/pdf/political-related-segments/" target="_blank"> standard political-related segments </a> that may indicate general political sentiment, interest in specific political issues, and political party affiliation.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  2.3 How We Disclose User Information</h3><p>  We may disclose User Information as follows:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Taboola Affiliates </strong>. We may disclose User Information to any current or future Affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries to process for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</li><li><strong> Taboola service providers </strong>. We may disclose User Information to vendors, service providers, agents, contractors, or others who perform functions (e.g., maintenance, data analysis, customer relationship management, email marketing, surveys, credit card processing, data hosting, or fraud detection) on our behalf.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Unaffiliated third parties </strong>. We may disclose User Information to other unaffiliated third parties, specifically with (i) our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/data-partners" target="_blank"> data partners </a>, so that we can connect you with relevant content by allowing our advertisers to target specific audience segments, and (ii) our <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/programmatic-demand-and-supply-partners" target="_blank"> programmatic demand and supply partners </a>, so that we can serve you with tailored advertisements.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Customers </strong>. We may disclose User Information to Customers where relevant to the Service we provide those Customers. For example, we may provide publishers with information about the viewing and click-through patterns of the content they publish and may provide advertisers with information about conversion rates for analytics purposes.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  2.4 Accessing Your User Information From Taboola</h3><p>  You have the right to request that Taboola provide you with access to the Personal Data we hold about you, correct your Personal Data, delete your Personal Data, and cease or restrict processing of your Personal Data. Please click <a href="https://accessrequest.taboola.com/access" target="_blank"> here </a> to make such a request.</p></div> <div><h3>  2.5 Interest-Based Advertising</h3><p>  Through our Services, including our Services on Customer websites, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Customer websites, browsers, or devices. For example, if on a first online visit, you browse on website A, then on a subsequent visit to website B, you may see content personalized based on your browsing history on website A. For example, if a user visits a clothing retail site, she might see clothing-related ads on another site she visits.</p></div> <p><p>  In order to target advertisements to you for products and services that may interest you, we may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), HTML5 local storage, and other technologies. For more information about how we use these technologies, please refer to our <a href="/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also work with third parties such as ad networks, which are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to websites that you have visited in the past. These advertisers will deliver you targeted advertisements for products and services that may interest you. Third-party ad networks, our advertiser Customers (and their content providers and agents), and/or traffic measurement services may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These <a href="https://www.taboola.com/policies/third-party-cookies-and-technologies" target="_blank"> third-party cookies and other technologies </a> are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have questions about our collection and use of data for interest-based advertising purposes, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@taboola.com" target="_blank"> support@taboola.com </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  2.6 User Choices and Opting Out</h3><p>  Taboola supports initiatives to offer our Users greater transparency and control over the uses of their Information.

If your browsers are configured to reject cookies, your opt-out may not be effective, since we identify your choice to opt-out based on an opt-out cookie we deliver to you.

If you are using a Safari browser on iOS11 or macOS High Sierra, you must first adjust your Privacy and Security Settings to turn off both “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking” and “Block All Cookies”, and then return to this privacy policy or your preferred opt out platform to reset your opt out preferences.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Taboola may use non-cookie technologies in limited cases. Like cookies, these technologies allow Taboola to recommend ads that are tailored to your interests and to remember whether you have chosen to opt-out from our Services. Please note that some web browsers may not permit you to block the use of non-cookie technologies, but you can do so by simply clicking on the Opt Out feature above in this Section 2.6.</li><li><strong> You can also opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by Taboola and other advertising companies </strong>.

These Taboola Ad Partners include advertisers and ad networks that may collect Information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different websites. Like most advertisers, Taboola works to place our advertisements where we think they will be most interesting and relevant to the recipient. One way we do this is by allowing ad networks to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the ad network to recognize individuals who have previously visited the Taboola Sites. Then, if the ad network has purchased ad space on a third-party website, and recognizes that same individual visiting that third-party website, the ad network can deliver a Taboola advertisement, knowing that this individual has already expressed interest in Taboola by visiting the Taboola Sites. To learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our <a href="/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  3.5 Site Visitor Choices</h3><p>  Site Visitors may opt out of the Taboola Ad Partners that collect information on the Sites to serve ads about Taboola.
