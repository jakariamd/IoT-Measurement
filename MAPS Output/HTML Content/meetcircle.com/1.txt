Some state laws broadly define “sale” such that it may include allowing third parties to receive certain information, e.g. cookies, to deliver personalized advertising on our services.

Circle does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 16 when creating or administering our Services.</p><p>  Our Services are expressly designed for parents to monitor the Internet and mobile activity of their children. As a result, certain personal information related to children’s devices may be accessible by the parent-administrators of the Services, as well as Circle in our administration of the Services. This data includes Navigation Information, which are the websites visited or apps used, as well as the times and days allocated to such uses. In some jurisdictions, this information may be deemed ‘personal’ and subject to local laws. Circle does not use Navigation Information for any commercial purpose other than to provide the Services.</p></div> <p><p>  Some versions of the MyCircle application (“MyCircle”) provide a secure platform for family members to send messages to one another via the Circle Services. Where MyCircle messages include personal information of children under the age of 16, prior consent of the parent or legal guardian of any such children is required. Therefore, when the MyCircle messaging feature is activated by a User, the User shall verify the MyCircle Users under the age of 16, and shall provide consent for Circle’s personal information collection practices for children under the age of 16. Failure to provide the necessary and required consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement, and grounds for termination of this Policy and Your use of Circle Services.</p></p> <p><p>  If You become aware that the Services or data associated with the Services is being used in a manner that may be a violation of our End User License Agreement or our Terms of Service, please let Us know by contacting Us at <a href="mailto:legalnotices@aura.com" target="_blank"> legalnotices@aura.com </a> so Circle can take appropriate action.
