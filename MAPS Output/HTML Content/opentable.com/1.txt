 restaurant search locations, enter your local dining city in your account 
 profile, when you are in proximity to certain beacons, choose to publish your 
 location in reviews you leave for restaurants on the Services, or in your 
 comments or other communications with us. When precise geographic location data

 other information about interactions with those restaurants)</span></span> <p><p>  <b> Aggregate Information. </b> We aggregate personal information collected directly from you,

 will process information in accordance with applicable laws, but we are not 
 responsible for any restaurant's use of information (including information used 
 by its affiliates and service providers) for which it is an owner or controller.

 local law. Where we use personal 
 information to meet our legitimate interests, we take steps to ensure that your 
 rights with respect to your personal information are not infringed. You can

 ground described above would not apply to processing of your personal 
 information by us, we will seek your consent for such specific purpose in 
 accordance with applicable law (such as sending direct marketing messages by 
 electronic means, like email, without an exception from the requirement to 
 obtain consent).</span></span> <p><p>  III.</p></p> <div><span>  HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</span><p>  We disclose the personal information we

 We may disclose or transfer your information to a third party if we sell, 
 transfer, divest, or disclose all or a portion of our business or assets to 
 another company in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, 
 financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction, or proceeding.</span></span> <span><span>  To protect rights and property.</span></span> <span><span>   We may 
 disclose your information to third parties when we believe in good faith that 
 disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, our property, the integrity of 
 the Services, personal safety, or the interests of you or any other person, and 
 to detect, prevent and/or otherwise address fraud, risk management, security or 
 technical issues.</span></span> <span><span>  To comply with and as required by law.</span></span> <span><span>   We

Additionally, we or our restaurant partners may be required to disclose certain information to local government health authorities as part of contact tracing programs related to COVID-19 or similar events. Please note that OpenTable does not store or retain health information collected in this context for OpenTable’s own purposes.</span></span> <span><span>  Aggregate information.</span></span> <span><span>   We share 
 aggregate statistical data for the improvement of our Services. We may also 
 share aggregate or de-identified information with third parties at our

 right to opt-out or object to our sharing of your information with certain third 
 parties. For more information, or to exercise these or other rights, see the <a href="#YourChoices" target="_blank"> Your Choices and Rights </a> section below.</p></p> <p><p>  Sharing with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates as a controller of your 
 personal information. </p></p> <span><span>  When you make a request 
 through our Services or through a restaurant, such as a restaurant reservation, 
 joining a restaurant waitlist, making a payment to a restaurant through our 
 Services, purchasing an event ticket, or if you are a guest of the person making 
 the request, we necessarily provide certain categories of your information to 
 the restaurant to facilitate that request. For requests to dine, this 
 information may include your name, profile, time and date of visit, party size, 
 your phone number, your dining preferences, guest information, any special 
 requests, information or comments that you choose to submit (if any), and your 
 email address. Your information is provided to the restaurant, just as it would 
 be if you contacted the restaurant directly. If you provide a mobile phone 
 number in connection with your request, restaurants may send you text messages 
 regarding your request. Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or 
 debit card account information to secure your reservation. When you make a 
 reservation at a restaurant that is part of a restaurant group, we may also 
 share additional information about your dining activity at that restaurant or 
 restaurant group in the past, your dining preferences and/or information that 
 we collect from you and third parties that may be relevant to that reservation.</span></span> <p><p>  In addition to providing you with more 
 customized Services, we may receive certain information from participating 
 restaurants from their Point of Sale terminals that we analyze to provide 
 aggregate information to the restaurant about their customers.</p></p> <p><p>  We also share with restaurants summary 
 reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant 
 through our Services, these comments may be shared with or may be accessible by 
 that restaurant, and the restaurant may respond to you. We will not tie your 
 comments with other information that can identify you directly, but a 
 restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly if 
 you give your name in the comments or provide contact information, such as an 
 email address.</p></p> <p><p>  Sharing 
 with Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates as a processor or service provider 
 on their behalf. </p></p> <span><span>  We act as a processor or service 
 provider for Restaurants and Restaurant Affiliates in certain circumstances as 
 described above (see above for more detail on <a href="#OurRoleAsControllerAndProcessor" target="_blank"> Our Role as Data Controller and Data 
 Processor </a>). In providing these services, we may, at the direction of the 
 restaurant, share certain of your information with the restaurant’s affiliated 
 restaurants (such as affiliated brands), restaurant group and/or restaurants 
 with the same brand or parent-brand (collectively, such restaurant’s “<b> restaurant group </b>”), or other entities 
 associated with the restaurant (such as the parent entity of the restaurant 
 group or affiliated hotels) and/or their service providers (collectively, the 
 associated entities and service providers, the restaurant’s "<b> restaurant affiliates </b>") under 
 OpenTable’s programs for the following purposes:</span></span> <div><span>  Customized services</span><span>  : restaurants may 
 share your information (such as meal or seating preferences or special 
 occasions) with their restaurant affiliates and restaurant group to enhance the 
 hospitality the restaurant group provides you when you dine with them (such as 
 trying to seat you by a window, if you previously expressed a preference for 
 window seating).</span><span>  Operations & Service Improvements</span><span>  : to 
 support operations, improve the restaurant’s table and shift planning, improve 
 their hospitality services, including supporting a loyalty program you have 
 chosen to participate in.</span></div> <div><span>  Marketing</span><span>  : as permitted by applicable 
 law, to perform analytics and tailor marketing to you.</span><span>  In-Product Communications</span><span>  : we offer you and restaurant partners means to communicate about restaurants, reservations and diner-related matters directly through our Services. We may access communications and may use automated means to review, scan, and analyze communications for security purposes, fraud prevention, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, investigations of potential misconduct, product development and improvement, research, or customer or technical support. We reserve the right to: (a) block the delivery of or transmission of or access to the communications; (b) block your access to the Services’ in-product communication feature; or (c) review communications that we, in our sole discretion, believe may contain malicious content, spam, or may pose a risk to you, us, or our restaurant partners.</span></div> <p><p>  For more information, please feel free to 
 contact the restaurants with which you dine or book reservations, or contact us 
 using the contact information listed in the <a href="#HowtoContactUs" target="_blank"> How to 
 Contact Us </a> section below. To learn more about your choices related to how 
 we share your information with restaurant groups and restaurant affiliates 
 under our programs, please see the <a href="#YourChoices" target="_blank"> Your Choices and 
 Rights section below. </a></p></p> <div><p>  Sharing with Our </p><span>  Group Companies. </span><span>  We share 
 your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries in the U.S. and worldwide, 
 as well as with our parent corporation, Booking Holdings Inc., and its other 
 subsidiaries (collectively, as also defined earlier in this Privacy Policy, “our 
 group companies”). We may share your information with our group companies for 
 the following reasons:</span><span>  Provide you with integrated 
 services (including to administer and manage reservations, purchases, services, 
 and payments across our affiliated platforms).</span></div> <span><span>  Provide personalized offers or 
 send you marketing communications with your consent or as otherwise permitted 
 by applicable law.</span></span> <span><span>  Provide customer support 
 services.</span></span> <span><span>  Detect, prevent, and 
 investigate fraud and misuse of our services, other illegal activities, and 
 data breaches.</span></span> <span><span>  Analyze how users use our 
 independent and affiliated platforms, including so that we may improve existing 
 products and services and develop new features, products, and services that may 
 be of interest to our users.</span></span> <span><span>  Ensure compliance with 
 applicable law.</span></span> <p><p>  To learn more about your choices related to 
 how we share your information with our group companies, please see the <a href="#YourChoices" target="_blank"> Your Choices and Rights </a> section below.</p></p> <div><p>  Sharing with Our Business Partners</p><span>  We share your information with other third-party business partners 
 for their own marketing purposes. These third parties include online 
 advertisers or ad tech companies, who may provide you with targeted advertising 
 and marketing communications, where permitted under law. The information we 
 share includes information collected through your use of our Services (e.g., 
 bookings, reservations, or other purchases) and information we collect about 
 you through the use of cookies and similar technologies (e.g., information 
 about the websites you visit; information about your searches, including the 
 cities or neighborhoods you search in, the type of restaurant or cuisine you searched 
 for, price range, intended dining date, and the number of diners). </span></div> <p><p>  For example, if you 
 frequently book reservations at Italian restaurants, we use that information to 
 help a particular Italian-themed restaurant group offer you a promotion.</p></p> <p><p>  To learn more about your choices related to 
 how we share your information with our business partners, please see the <a href="#YourChoices" target="_blank"> Your Choices and Rights </a> section below.</p></p> <div><p>  Sharing with Social Networking Services</p><p>    Our Services allow you to 
 connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or 
 with friends. Our Services may also allow you to connect with us on, share on, 
 and use third-party platforms, including those on which OpenTable has a presence. 
 Please be mindful of your personal privacy needs and the privacy needs of 
 others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We 
 cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public 
 or share with others. OpenTable also does not control the privacy practices of 
 third-party platforms. Please contact those sites and services directly to 
 learn about their privacy practices.</p></div> <div><p>  Sharing to Process Payment Information</p><span>  To use certain Services (such as to make reservations at certain 
 restaurants; to make payments to certain restaurants or to secure reservations; 
 and to purchase tickets to events, or other products or services), we require 
 credit or debit card account information. When you submit your credit or debit 
 card account information through our Services, we share that information with 
 restaurants, third-party payment processors, and other third-party service 
 providers (including, but not limited to, vendors who provide fraud detection 
 services to us and other third parties) to the extent necessary to meet our 
 contractual obligations to you (e.g., to secure your reservation or make a 
 payment to a restaurant where required), to meet our legitimate interests in 
 preventing fraud and other misuse of our platforms, or with your consent where 
 this is required by law. In particular:</span></div> <span><span>  When you use a credit or debit 
 card to secure a reservation through our Services, we provide your credit or 
 debit card account information (including card number and expiration date, but 
 excluding the CVV number) to our third-party payment service providers and the 
 applicable restaurant.</span></span> <span><span>  When you initially provide your 
 credit or debit card account information through our Services in order to use 
 our restaurant payment services, we provide your credit or debit card account 
 information to our third-party payment service providers. As explained in the 
 OpenTable Terms of Use, these third parties may store your credit or debit card 
 account information so you can use our restaurant payment services through our 
 Services in the future, to the extent permitted by local law.</span></span> <span><span>  For information about the 
 security of your credit or debit card account information, see the <a href="#HowWeStoreandProtect" target="_blank"> How We Store and Protect Your Information </a> 
 section below.</span></span> <div><p>  Sharing with Other Service Providers</p><span>  We share information with third-party 
 vendors, consultants, and other service providers who perform services or 
 functions on our behalf (e.g., hosting or operating our Services, data 
 collection, reporting, ad response measurement, site analytics, data analysis, 
 delivering marketing messages and advertisements, processing credit card 
 payments, and providing fraud detection services). We do not authorize these 
 third parties to use or disclose your information for purposes other than for 
 which it has been provided. We require these third parties to maintain and 
 implement security measures to protect your information from unauthorized 
 access or processing.</span></div> <p><p>  Consent to Data Collection by Google Analytics.
</p></p> <span><span>   If you provide us with your consent to use Functional Cookies and, thus, Google Analytics, 
    we use Google Analytics to continuously optimize our website. 
    We use Google Analytics to collect aggregated, anonymous data. 
    This data helps us understand how customers use our platform and 
    identify opportunities for improvement. Google Analytics anonymizes 
    your IP address to protect your data. No other personal data is 
    collected that would allow an identification. The legal basis for 
    this data processing is Article 6 (1) lit. a GDPR. 
    You may provide your consent or withdraw your consent 
    to the described data processing by Google Analytics <a href="" target="_blank"> here </a>.
 </span></span> <p><p>  Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided 
    by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA. 
    Google Analytics cookies and similar technologies that are stored on your terminal 
    device enable an analysis of your use of this website. This information is used to 
    evaluate your use of the website and to compile reports on website or app activities. 
    The processing of the data after its transmission by OpenTable to Google is 
    carried out by Google as the sole data controller. In this context, Google, 
    as the sole data controller, may store data about you in the USA. 
    The European Court of Justice has determined that the USA provide for an 
    insufficient level of data protection. In this context, there is a risk 
    that your data may be processed by US institutions or authorities for 
    control and monitoring purposes without you having an adequate legal 
    remedy against this.
</p></p> <p><p>  IV.</p></p> <div><span>  HOW WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</span><p>  OpenTable maintains commercially-reasonable 
 technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect 
 your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, 
 alteration, and destruction.That said, please note that no Internet transmission
  can ever be guaranteed 100 percent secure, and so we encourage you to take care 
  when disclosing personal information online and to use readily available tools, 
  such as Internet firewalls, secure email, and similar technologies to protect 
  yourself online.</p></div> <p><p>  You play an important role in keeping your 
    information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other 
    security information for your OpenTable account with anyone. If we receive 
    instructions using your user name and password, we will assume you have 
    authorized the instructions. If you have reason to believe that your 
    interaction with us is no longer secure (e.g., if you feel that the security of 
    any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us 
    immediately as detailed in the <a href="#HowtoContactUs" target="_blank"> How to Contact Us </a> 
    section below.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Card Information. </b>When your credit or debit card account 
 information is being transmitted to our Services or through our Services, it 
 will be protected by cryptographic protocols. To be clear, OpenTable does not 
 itself store your credit or debit card account information, and we do not have 
 direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account 
 information. We use third party payment processors that are the controllers of 
 your credit card information. Our contracts with third parties that receive 
 your credit or debit card account information require them to keep it secure 
 and confidential.</p></p> <p><p>  However, we cannot guarantee that 
 transmissions of your credit or debit card account information or your other 
 information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never 
 be able to defeat the security measures taken by OpenTable or our third-party 
 service providers. Except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded or 
 limited due to applicable law, we assume no liability or responsibility for 
 disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized 
 third-party access, or other causes beyond our control. </p></p> <p><p>  Retention. </p></p> <span><span>  We may retain your personal information for as long as your account 
 is active and for a period of time thereafter to allow you to re-activate your 
 account without loss of information. We may also retain your personal 
 information as necessary to: </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>Maintain 
      logs and business records for analysis, security, and/or audit purposes</li><li>Comply 
      with record retention requirements under the law</li><li>Deal with
