For example, the products you order through our marketplace are from third parties, you can download applications from third-party application providers from our App Store, and enable third-party skills through our Alexa services. We also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as sellers on the marketplace, restaurants registered on Amazon.in, merchants providing mobile recharges and bill-payment assistance.

Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc. or Amazon Seller Services Private Limited or any of its affiliates, or substantially all of their assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Protection of Amazon and Others: </strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000" target="_blank"> Conditions of Use </a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon, our users, or others.

<strong> Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites: </strong> Amazon Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at Amazon, including interest-based ads, please read our </p><span>  <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202075050" target="_blank"> Interest-Based Ads policy </a>. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/adprefs" target="_blank"> Advertising Preferences </a> page. </span></div> <p><p>  
<strong> Use of Third-Party Advertising Services: </strong> We provide ad companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant Amazon ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie, a device identifier, or a code derived from applying irreversible cryptography to other information like an email address.
 For example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by going to the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/adprefs" target="_blank"> Advertising Preferences </a> page.</p></p> <div><h2>   What Information Can I Access?</h2><p>   You can access your information, including your name, address, payment options, profile information, Prime membership, household settings, and purchase history in the "Your Account" section of the website or mobile application.
