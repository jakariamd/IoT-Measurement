This statement does not apply to the information we process on behalf of our customers via our cloud analytics solutions (which is subject to our customer agreements), but it does apply to the information we collect about the individuals that use these solutions on behalf of our customers. </p></div> <p><p>  We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this statement and, in cases where there are material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification) prior to the changes becoming effective. We encourage you to review the Privacy Statement whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that our Services are designed for enterprise customers, and we process personal information of business contacts who work for those customers. Some U.S. state privacy laws (such as Virginia) do not apply to personal information collected in a commercial context and so would not apply to the personal information we process under this Privacy Statement.</p></p> <div><h2>  CONTENTS</h2></div> <div><h2>  COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2><p>  Information You Provide to Us</p><p>  We collect information when you register for an account, fill out a form or a survey, attend an event or training, post on our blog or Community forum, make a purchase, request customer support, access content (like a whitepaper), apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.

At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Sumo Logic should interpret DNT signals. Therefore, Sumo Logic does not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.</p></p> <div><h2>  YOUR CHOICES</h2><p>  Account Information</p><p>  You may update certain account information you provide via our Services (such as your name and email address) by logging into your account, but note that we retain certain information when required or permitted by law.</p><p>  Promotional Communications</p><p>  You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages from Sumo Logic by following the instructions in those emails or text messages.

For more details about the personal information we collect, including the categories of sources, please see the “<a href="#collectionOfInformation" target="_blank"> Collection of Information </a>” section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the “Use of Information” section above.

Further details on our sharing are provided below:</p></div> <div><td>  <strong> CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></td><td>  <strong> CATEGORIES OF RECIPIENTS WITH WHOM INFORMATION MAY BE SHARED </strong></td><ul>  <li>Identifiers (such as name and contact information)</li><li>Professional or employment-related information and education history (such as for job applications or about potential and current customer contacts)</li><li>Internet or other network activity information (such as browsing behavior)</li><li>Inferences (such as approximate location or product interests)</li><li>Other personal information (such as payment method information)</li><li>Affiliates and subsidiaries</li><li>Analytics providers</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Cloud storage providers</li><li>Customer relationship management providers</li><li>Communications providers</li><li>Marketing and advertising partners</li><li>Payment processing companies</li><li>Providers of recruiting and application management services</li><li>Other people with whom you choose to share your information, like when you post on our blog or community forum</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We offer various financial incentives.

For example, we may provide branded Sumo gear to survey participants, gift boxes for customers attending events, free add-ons to our Services for joining a promotion, or a limited discount for new customers. When you participate in a financial incentive, we collect personal information from you, such as identifiers like your name and email address. You can opt into a financial incentive by following the sign-up instructions for that financial incentive, and for any ongoing benefits you have the ability to opt-out of the incentive at any time such as by following the unsubscribe instructions in our promotional emails. In some cases, we may provide additional terms and conditions for a financial incentive, which we will provide to you when you sign up. The value of your personal information is reasonably related to the value of what is presented to you.</p></p> <p><p>  Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories and specific pieces of personal information, to delete their personal information, to opt out of certain uses of sensitive personal information (should that become applicable to our processing), and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p></p> <p><p>  California Consumers also have the right to opt out of targeted advertising, sharing, and sales of personal information. As described in the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section above, we work with third parties (including advertising partners and social media platforms) to serve you personalized ads on other websites and services based on the identifiers and electronic network activity information they receive through our Services. Some of these activities may be considered “sales” or “sharing” of your personal information. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16.</p></p> <p><p>  California consumers can opt out of “sales” and “sharing” occurring through these activities by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank"> www.aboutads.info </a>. California consumers may make any other rights request by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@sumologic.com" target="_blank"> privacy@sumologic.com </a> or toll-free at 855-564-7866. We are also in the process of updating our website to enable a site-specific opt-out in and will update this Statement to include that option immediately then. We will verify your request by asking you to provide information that matches information we have on file about you. You can also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on their behalf. Authorized agents should submit requests through the same channels, but we will require proof that the person is authorized to act on your behalf and may also still ask you to verify your identity with us directly. </p></p> <p><p>  We retain personal data no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, unless applicable law requires storage for a longer period of time.</p></p> <div><h2>  INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA), SWITZERLAND AND UK</h2><p>  The remaining sections of this statement apply to you if you use our Services while in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or UK.</p><p>  Legal Basis for Processing</p><p>  When we process your personal data we will only do so in the following situations:</p><ul>  <li>As necessary to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (like providing the products or services you have requested)</li><li>When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data, including to communicate with you about changes to our Services, to help secure and improve our Services (including to prevent fraud) and to analyze use of our Services and potential sales leads</li><li>As necessary to comply with our legal obligations</li><li>When we have your consent to do so</li></ul></div> <div><p>  Data Subject Requests</p><p>  Subject to certain limits and conditions provided under law, you have the following rights:</p><ul>  <li>You have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or made available in a portable form.</li><li>You also have the right to object to certain processing (like receiving direct marketing), or to request that we restrict processing in certain circumstances (like to retain but not further process pending resolution of a claim).</li><li>If you provide consent to any of our processing activities, you may later withdraw that consent at any time.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>You have a right to file a complaint regarding our data protection practices with a supervisory authority.
