<div><h2>  Intuit Global Privacy Statement</h2><p>  <strong> Last Updated: December 1, 2022 </strong></p><p>  Intuit responsibly leverages technology to power prosperity around the world. We believe that everyone has a right to privacy. As a financial services and technology company, we’re providing this Global Privacy Statement (“<strong> Privacy Statement </strong></p><span>  ”) to explain how we, Intuit Inc. and the <a href="https://www.intuit.com/legal/intuit-group-companies/" target="_blank"> Intuit group companies </a> </span></div> <span><span>  (collectively “<strong> Intuit, </strong></span></span> <span><span>  ” “<strong> we, </strong></span></span> <span><span>  ” “<strong> us, </strong></span></span> <div><span>  ” or “<strong> our </strong></span><span>  ”), collect, use, share, or otherwise process information that we collect through our services. These services include, as applicable, our websites, mobile applications, social media pages, marketing activities, and other activities described in this Privacy Statement, or when other businesses provide us your personal information (collectively, the “<strong> Services </strong></span><span>  ”). This Privacy Statement is global, meaning it applies to all Intuit Services. We may provide additional or supplemental privacy statements for certain products or services.</span></div> <div><p>  This Privacy Statement describes our privacy practices when we process:</p><ul>  <li>Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, “<strong> Tax Preparation Information </strong></li></ul><span>  ”) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;</span><ul>  <li>Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of our websites and the Intuit platform, which includes all of Intuit’s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) other than Tax Preparation Information (the “<strong> Intuit Platform </strong></li></ul></div> <div><span>  ”); and</span><ul>  <li>Personal information as necessary to manage, run, improve, and develop our business and personalize your experience while interacting with the Intuit Platform. Depending on your settings, this may include showing you personalized ads or recommending certain Intuit products based on your interests.</li></ul><p>  Intuit determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, and therefore acts as a ‘data controller’ (or equivalent/similar terms under applicable data privacy laws) of such information. We may share your personal information within the <a href="https://www.intuit.com/legal/intuit-group-companies/" target="_blank"> Intuit group companies </a></p></div> <span><span>   and conduct processing activities as controllers or joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.</span></span> <p><p>  In certain circumstances, there may be more than one data controller processing your personal information. For example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as a data controller. In these situations, we act as an independent data controller over our processing activities. This means we determine how your personal information will be processed independently from the other data controllers. The other data controllers have their own obligations under applicable data privacy laws. Intuit is not responsible for other data controllers’ processing activities, and you should contact them directly for questions about how they process your personal information and about how to exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing.</p></p> <p><p>  This Privacy Statement does not apply where Intuit processes personal information as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including when we process personal information on behalf of customers of our professional tax software products. When we act as a processor or service provider, the privacy statement of our customer who uses our Services applies instead of this Privacy Statement, and our processing of such personal information is governed by our agreements with such customers. If you have concerns about personal information that we process on behalf of a customer, or wish to exercise your privacy rights regarding such personal information, please contact the customer directly.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have any questions about how Intuit processes your personal information, please see <a href="#contact" target="_blank"> How to contact us </a></p></p> <span><span>   below.</span></span> <div><h2>  The Intuit Platform and your personal information</h2><p>  When we say “platform,” we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), Intuit uses that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you’re using. This means that, for example, we may use your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, contact and purchase history details from Mailchimp, and/or recommendations from Credit Karma. The personal information we use in this centralized way may relate to you as an end user of our Services or as a customer or vendor of an Intuit customer whose personal information has been included in the Intuit Platform.</p></div> <div><h2>  Business account information</h2><p>  Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with a business (such as your employer). If you are granted access to business account (for example, in QuickBooks), the business owner or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights; making decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll); or requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift). If the owner or designated administrator changes your access rights, then you may lose access to the information the business controls.</p></div> <p><p>  Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of a business account may be subject to the business’s policies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other businesses, and you should consider both the business’s policies and whether you are comfortable giving the business access to your personal information before connecting to their services.</p></p> <p><p>  The personal information that we collect or otherwise receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account, and the choices you make, including your privacy settings. The way we process your personal information may also depend on the particular Services, functionalities, or experiences you use, your location, and applicable law.</p></p> <div><h2>  Information you provide to us</h2><p>  You may provide us with your personal information as follows:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Contact data and account profile data. </strong></li></ul><span>   We collect information when you (or your organization) create an account, activate a subscription, and/or upload information to the Intuit Platform. Personal information may include your name, previous name(s) and/or nicknames, title and honorifics, professional title and company name, education, billing and mailing addresses, phone number and email address, profile photo, billing information (your payment information), purchase history, demographic information, preferences, subscription data, and your username and account credentials.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Identity verification information. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We collect information to verify your identity, including your name, date of birth, social security number, social insurance number, driver’s license number, passport number, government-issued identification details, and similar information to verify your identity and to help you file your tax return.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Communications, feedback and survey data, and related data.  </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, telephone number and any other personal information you choose to share when you reach out to us for support, give us feedback, participate in optional surveys, attend our events, participate in product research or training, or otherwise interact or communicate with us. This information may include: call center recordings and call monitoring records, chat and text records, voicemails, photographs, and video images.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Marketing data. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   You may provide us with your contact information and preferences for receiving our marketing communications. </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Social and community content. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We receive content you post on our social media pages and our community pages.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Business and financial information. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may receive information about your business, your finances, expenses, invoices, financial statements, details of your financial transactions, payroll details, payment details, tax return details, details about your customers, vendors, or employees, income and wage information, and/or investment information.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Interactions with experts. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   The Intuit Platform provides many opportunities for you to connect with live experts, including, for example, accountants or tax preparers. When you interact with these experts, we may receive information about the questions you ask, the details of your accounts, and the guidance provided to you.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Device and contact data. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   If you grant permission in your device settings, certain features may have access to your device and contacts.</span></span> <div><h2>  Third-party sources</h2><p>  The Intuit Platform is designed to help you connect with other people and businesses. As a result of those connections, others may be able to input personal information about you, including other customers using the Intuit Platform. For example, an Intuit customer may share personal information about you with us in order to use and benefit from the Intuit Platform. You also may be able to input or process personal information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator of one of our products or use Intuit to manage customer lists. If you input information about others into the Platform, you must only do so if you have first provided sufficient notice and received any required permissions, and have an appropriate legal basis if required by applicable law.</p></div> <p><p>  We may also receive personal information about you from other third parties where you have provided consent or where permitted by applicable law. We protect and process the personal information obtained from those third parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information. Our third-party sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform. For example, we receive information from:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Linked third-party services. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   If you choose to sync a non-Intuit account/service with your Intuit account, we will receive information from that account/service according to your settings with that account/service. This may include details of your bank account information, social media information, purchase history or your business’s sales records through a point of sale application.  </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Supplemental information and identity verification providers. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We work with certain third parties to help us verify your identity, the specifics of your business, and/or supplement the personal information you have provided and ensure the accuracy of your personal information. For example, we use third-party providers to validate your contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, phone number) or to provide additional details about your business. These providers may include, for example, your financial institution, telecommunications provider, or email provider.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Customer support providers. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We receive personal information about you or your interaction with the Intuit Platform from certain third parties for troubleshooting purposes. For example, we may obtain information about your interaction(s) with customer support and information about technical issues you have raised, including </span></span> <span><span>  call center recordings, call monitoring records, voicemails, photographs and chat records</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Credit bureaus and related third parties. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   Many Intuit features rely on information we receive from credit bureaus and related third parties. For example, in some countries, we may offer free credit reports and credit scores. We request these reports and credit scores on your behalf from credit bureau partners, like TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These partners may also provide personal information such as employment or income data, social security number, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so we can make more personalized recommendations for you. </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Other users. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   As described above, we may receive personal information about you from other Intuit Platform users, such as your accountant, bookkeeper, tax preparer, spouse, employer, or other business customers using the Intuit Platform (e.g., businesses from which you buy products or services, or with which you otherwise interact). We may also collect such personal information through features like member referral programs.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Risk management, cybersecurity & anti-fraud providers. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may receive personal information from third parties that help us assess risks associated with our offerings, including to help combat fraud and illegal activity and to help protect your personal information.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Data providers. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may receive information from information services and data licensors that provide demographic and preference information to us.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Content providers. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may receive personal information from companies that make user-generated content from their service available to others, such as local business reviews or public social media posts.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Joint offering partners. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may offer co-branded services or experiences or engage in joint-marketing activities with others, including through our conferences or live events.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Government agencies. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We receive information from government agencies, including from various tax agencies, such as your tax filing confirmation from the IRS. </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Public information. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We collect individual and household demographic information and preference information from publicly available sources, such as open government databases, social media platforms, and others.</span></span> <div><h2>  Automatic data collection</h2><p>  We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log personal information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Services, such as:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Device information. </strong></li></ul><span>   We may collect information about your device(s) such as IP addresses, log information, error messages, device type, and unique device identifiers. For example, we may collect IP addresses from you as part of our sign in and security features. </span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Usage information. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may collect information about your use of the Intuit Platform, such as the pages you viewed, the services and features you used or interacted with, your browser type, and details about any links or communications with which you interacted.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location information. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion information, or both, if you or your organization grant(s) us permission to do so through your device settings (for example, if you use QuickBooks’ time-tracking service, participate in Karma Drive, or use CK Money to locate nearby ATMs).</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Information stored locally. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   Some of our web-enabled desktop services and offerings synchronize with the information on your computer. In doing so, we may collect information such as device information, product usage, and error reports. We may also store personal information locally on your device.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Communication interaction data. </strong></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We or our third-party service providers may collect information from email providers, communication providers and social networks, such as your interactions with our email, text or other communications (e.g., whether you open and/or forward emails) – we may do this through use of pixel tags (which are also known as clear GIFs), which may be embedded invisibly in our emails.</span></span> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Online behavioral data </strong></li></ul><span>  . We may automatically collect certain personal information about your use and interactions with our websites, customers’ websites or e-commerce stores, social media websites, and marketing campaigns that we or our customers organize, including device information (such as your IP address and unique device IDs), page view information and search results, links, and if you are a customer contact, whether or not a campaign presented or sent to you using our offerings has been viewed, delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it has bounced or was treated as spam.</span></div> <div><h2>  Cookies and similar technologies</h2><ul>  <li>Intuit and our service providers may use commonly used tools such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, local shared objects and similar technologies (collectively “cookies”) to collect information about you (“Cookie Information”) so we can provide the experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers’ experiences.
