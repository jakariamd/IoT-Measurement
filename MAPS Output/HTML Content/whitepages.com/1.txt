<div><h1>  Consumer Privacy Rights</h1></div> <div><h3>  Last Updated June 28, 2023</h3><p>  If you would like to remove your personal directory information (e.g., name, address, phone number, etc.) from public display on Whitepages’ websites and applications, please review the instructions in our FAQ <a href="https://support.whitepages.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010106908-How-do-I-edit-or-remove-a-personal-listing" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p><p>  If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, you have additional rights under applicable state law, as set forth below.  Whitepages is committed to data privacy and providing a simple and secure process for consumers to manage their personal information.</p></div> <div><h1>  1. Rights for California Residents</h1><p>  If you reside in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CCPA”) provides you with certain rights. These rights are described in detail below. Please note, we will seek to verify your identity when we receive a verifiable individual rights request from you in order to ensure the security of your personal information. All terms not otherwise defined in this portion shall have the meanings as defined under the CCPA, along with any implementing regulations.</p></div> <div><h2>  Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing</h2><p>  You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information.  We provide three options to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information. You only need to make your request using one of the following:</p><ul>  <li>Make a request to a customer service agent by filling out our <a href="https://whitepagesprivacy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> online form </a>;</li><li>Submit an email request to privacyrequest@whitepages.com; OR</li><li>Fill out the automated tool in the box below with the URL of your Whitepages listing (instructions for obtaining the URL are below). Exercising your right using the automated tool will both opt you out of the sale and sharing of your information and will also remove your listing from the Whitepages website. You will need to provide a phone number and agree to Whitepages’ Terms of Service. The phone number will not be used for any purpose other than completing your opt-out request. If you would prefer not to provide a phone number or agree to Whitepages’ Terms of Service, please submit a request to a customer service agent using the first or second option (<a href="https://whitepagesprivacy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> online form </a> or email) listed above.</li></ul></div> <div><p>  <strong> Instructions for Obtaining URL of Your Whitepages Listing: </strong></p><ul>  <li>Visit whitepages.com</li><li>Enter your name and city/state in the People Search filter</li><li>Click on the result/listing that matches your identity</li><li>Copy the URL/link in the browser for your listing</li><li>Paste URL/link in the opt out tool here</li></ul><p>  <strong> PLEASE NOTE </strong>: You do not have to create an account or make a purchase to submit an opt-out request. If you use the automated tool (option 3 above), you will need to provide a phone number and agree to Whitepages’ Terms of Service. The phone number will not be used for any purpose other than completing your opt-out request. If you would prefer not to provide a phone number or agree to Whitepages’ Terms of Service, please submit a request to a customer service agent using the first or second option (webform or email) listed above. You may need to provide additional information to a customer service agent so that your opt-out request may be processed. Once a listing is removed, all known connected listings are also removed and the requester's information will not be sold by Whitepages in any capacity regardless of how/where the information was obtained. If you should happen to find your listing, or an additional listing you believe relates to you, on the site after completing an opt-out request, please submit a request to a customer service agent using the first or second option (webform or email) above.</p></div> <p><p>  CCPA opt-out requests may take up to 15 days to process but are often processed more quickly when feasible. Any agents making requests on your behalf may need to provide written, signed permission authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Global Privacy Controls </strong>: With respect to our sharing or selling personal information in the context of online tracking, Global Privacy Controls may allow you to opt out of the collection, sharing and use of your information and are available through certain browsers or plug-ins. If you reside in California, Whitepages will comply with the signal according to applicable laws and regulations.
