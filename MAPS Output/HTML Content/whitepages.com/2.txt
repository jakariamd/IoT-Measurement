How do we collect information?</h3><p>  The data we collect depends on the services and features of our products that you use. You provide some data directly, such as when you create an account, submit a search query, or contact us for support. Our servers collect information known as “log data,” that includes your IP address, the time your computer or device visited the site, the URL of the website you arrived from, and the type of device or browser you used to access the site. We and our partners also get information by recording how you use our services and whether you navigate between our services and other sites. For example, we use cookies (small text files placed on your device) and web beacons (small graphic images contained in a Web page or email) and may receive usage data from software running on your device. Our partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies for similar purposes.  For example, ad networks may place or recognize a cookie on a visitor's computer to understand web usage patterns of people who see advertisements and show advertising based on this combined information, including advertising for our products.  Web beacons or similar technologies from third-party analytics providers may help us compile aggregated statistics about our services, and the effectiveness of our websites, promotional campaigns or other operations.</p></div> <p><p>  We may also obtain information about users and non-users from third party sources, including surveys or questionnaires, data licensors, public records, affiliated entities, marketing companies, and other consumers who use our products. We use this information to validate and enrich information in our databases so that we can provide and improve services to users of our products.</p></p> <div><h3>  5. How do we protect your information?</h3><p>  We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p><p>  You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer/phone, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p></div> <div><h3>  6. How do you access and control your personal information?</h3><p>  You may use your account to access, correct, or change any personal information that you have provided to us or that is associated with your account. You may also email our customer support team at support@whitepages.com.</p><p>  If you would like to stop receiving marketing materials messages from Whitepages, please provide us with the email address you would like to unsubscribe by mailing support@whitepages.com.

INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THIRD PARTIES</h2></div> <div><h3>  1. What information is collected by third parties when you visit our websites?</h3><p>  Third parties may collect information during your visits to our websites and use of our mobile applications. Such information includes searches you perform (e.g., names searched, locations searched) and general information about you (e.g., browser type, mobile device type, unique user ID, mobile carrier, IP address, date and time of your visits, locality, pages viewed). Certain products and services may collect specific information such as your name, phone number, IP address, etc., but unless you provide specific details about yourself, information collected by such third parties will generally be limited to non-personally identifiable information.</p></div> <div><h3>  2. How is information collected by third parties?</h3><p>  Third parties may collect information by using cookies, web beacons, or other technologies. A cookie is a small file that contains a unique ID tag and stores information (e.g., pages visited, information voluntarily provided). A web beacon is a small graphic file used to identify if a page has been viewed.</p></div> <div><h3>  3. Why do these third parties collect information?</h3><p>  Third parties may collect information in order to (i) deliver relevant online and mobile advertising to you both on and off our sites; (ii) help us provide or analyze usage and effectiveness of our products and services; and (iii) for their own business purposes (e.g., such as to report aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about the use of their services and technologies).</p></div> <div><h3>  4. How will they use the information they collect? Will they share it?</h3><p>  Collection and use of data is subject to the privacy policies of the third party companies with whom we work, such as the privacy policy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010" target="_blank"> Amazon </a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank"> Google </a>. Accordingly, please review those policies for specific information.</p></div> <div><h3>  5. How do I stop the collection and use of my information by third parties?</h3><p>  To exercise choices regarding information collection for purposes of relevant online advertising, <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank"> click here </a>.  If you prefer not to have your data collected and analyzed by Google, you may install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"> Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on </a>. If you prefer to opt-out of personalized advertising from Amazon, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/adprefs" target="_blank"> click here </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  Some browsers may allow users to automatically transmit a “Do Not track” signal to web sites and online services, but, because there is no consensus on how “Do Not track” signals should be interpreted, Whitepages currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not track” signal from a user's browser.</p></p> <div><h3>  6. What about interest-based advertising?</h3><p>  We follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (about the collection and use of data for interest-based advertising) and expect third parties to comply with the disclosure and notification program specified by principles. This means that third parties collecting and using this data are asked to provide a standard icon/link in or near their advertisements that will provide you with additional data about their privacy and advertising practices, as well as with the opportunity to directly opt-out of having your information collected. To exercise choices about receiving certain interest-based advertising, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank"> click here </a>. Whitepages is not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.  Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access, your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.</p></div> <div><h2>  C.
