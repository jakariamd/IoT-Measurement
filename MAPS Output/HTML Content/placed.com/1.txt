<div><h1>  Foursquare Privacy Policy</h1></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Consumer Services Privacy Policy </strong></h3><p>  Last Updated: March 07, 2023</p></div> <div><h4>  English<strong>  | Korean ( </strong></h4></div> <div><h3>  Foursquare’s Privacy Policy for Consumer Services explains how Foursquare collects, uses and shares your personal data. This Privacy Policy applies globally to all applications, websites, and other online services offered by Foursquare and our affiliates (collectively “Consumer Services”). Please see our <a href="https://location.foursquare.com/legal/privacy-center/enterprise/" target="_blank"> Developer & Enterprise Services Privacy Policy </a> for details about our information practices related to our Developer & Enterprise Services.</h3></div> <div><h2>  About Location Data</h2><p>  <strong> “Location Data” </strong> is a type of personal data that, when collected and used responsibly, can help you navigate and interact with the physical and digital worlds around you. Location data is collected using various technologies such as the location services of your operating system or browser, sensor data from your device, and other data that may help us understand your precise location. Ever type in a business name into Uber, or tag your location in a photo before sharing on Twitter? Or, have you ever received a notification for a coupon when you’re passing by your favorite fast food joint? Foursquare powers these features as well as others that help people navigate, explore, and enjoy the world around them.Most importantly, location data should only be collected when you say it is okay to do so, and you should be able to change your mind at any time. The collection of location data should also benefit you, the user.  That’s why we only allow partners to use our location technology if they can demonstrate that the use of our technology is necessary to offer benefits or provide value to consumers who opt-in to sharing their location data. You can visit <a href="https://foursquare.com/privacy/" target="_blank"> Our Privacy Stance </a> to learn more about our position on important privacy matters. You can control the collection of location data at any time through your device settings. While the exact settings may differ depending on your device, typically, you will be given options that range from never sharing, to being asked to share each time you open an app, to only sharing while using an app, to always sharing.  When location data settings are set to “always” (i.e., persistent background location is turned “on”), your device’s location data will be shared with us even if you are not actively using our apps or other Consumer Services.Foursquare is also a participating member of the Network Advertising Initiative’s Precise Location Solution Provider Enhanced Standards which, among other things, requires that participating members not use, allow the use of, sell, or share any information about device or user activity correlated to a known Sensitive Points of Interest, including: – Places of religious worship;– Correctional facilities;– Places that may be used to infer an LGBTQ+ identification;– Places that may be used to infer engagement with explicit sexual content, material, or acts;– Places primarily intended to be occupied by children under 16;– Domestic abuse shelters, including rape crisis centers;– Welfare or homeless shelters and halfway houses;– Dependency or addiction treatment centers;– Medical facilities that cater predominantly to sensitive conditions, such as cancer centers, HIV/AIDS, fertility or abortion clinics, mental health treatment facilities, or emergency room trauma centers;– Places that may be used to infer refugee or immigrant status, such as refugee or immigration centers and immigration services;– Credit repair, debt services, bankruptcy services, or payday lending institutions;– Temporary places of assembly such as political rallies, marches, or protests, during the times that such rallies, marches, or protests take place;– Military Bases</p></div> <div><h2>  <strong> Commitment to Accountability </strong></h2><p>  Foursquare participates in the following organizations and programs: <strong> Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”). </strong> Foursquare designs our products to adhere to the DAA’s <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/principles" target="_blank"> Self-Regulatory Principles </a> and participates in the DAA’s <a href="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank"> Your AdChoices </a>, which is an easy way to opt out of digital advertising. <strong> Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). </strong> Foursquare is a member of the NAI and adheres to the NAI <a href="https://thenai.org/accountability/code-enforcement/" target="_blank"> Code of Conduct </a> and <a href="https://thenai.org/accountability/precise-location-information-solution-provider-voluntary-enhanced-standards/" target="_blank"> Precise Location Solution Provider Enhanced Standards </a>. <strong> EU/Swiss-US Privacy Shield.  </strong>Although not currently used for data transfers, Foursquare’s privacy practices comply with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

This data helps us better understand your use, interactions, and experiences with our Consumer Services. You can learn more about our use of these tools in our <a href="https://location.foursquare.com/legal/cookiepolicy/" target="_blank"> Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy </a>.</p></div> <div><h4>  <strong> Data From Third Parties </strong></h4><p>  We also receive data from third parties. Our third party data sources may vary over time but can include:  – This includes third parties who create and deliver experiences using our Developer & Enterprise Services, such as the incorporation of our location technology (i.e., SDK or APIs) into their apps and websites. In some cases, these third parties may license data to us. – This includes third parties who provide us commercially available data, including demographic data, data about how you interact with a third party’s websites, apps, smart TVs and streaming devices, device data (including mobile device and advertising identifiers, such as Apple IDFA or Google Advertising ID, and location data), and information from cookies, pixels and other similar technologies.<em>  –  </em>Personal data may be collected when you access our apps through social media logins (i.e., logging in to our apps using your Facebook or other social media credentials). The basic details we receive may depend on your social network account privacy settings, but could include name, email address, date of birth, gender, hometown and/or friends.  <em>  –  </em>This includes third parties who  specialize in providing enterprise data, analytics and software as a service. This data tends to be aggregated, pseudonymized or otherwise de-identified.</p></div> <p><p>  We also combine and bundle data collected from these different sources, as well as from Foursquare affiliates, and create inferences in order to deliver, maintain, and personalize our Consumer Services, and to operate our business.You can learn more about Foursquare’s data collection, including categories, examples and sources, in the chart below. </p></p> <div><h2>  <strong> At A Glance – Foursquare’s Data Collection – Consumer Services </strong></h2><p>  Data that does not contain any personal data that can be used to identify you or has otherwise been de-identified or aggregated is not considered personal data. To the extent we process deidentified data, we will maintain and use the data in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the data unless permitted by applicable law.When we collect data, we rely on several legal bases, these include: <strong> Contract Performance. </strong> When the processing is necessary to perform our contract with you, such as our Terms of Service. This may include providing you with our Consumer Services or tailoring the Consumer Services to your preferences;<strong> Legitimate Interests. </strong> When the processing is necessary for our legitimate business interests (or those of our enterprise customers), including but not limited to, improving the Consumer Services or providing our Products;<strong> Consent.  </strong>When you have given us your consent, including as described in this Privacy Policy. You may withdraw your consent to processing at any time using the settings on your device or in your account;<strong> Legal Obligation.  </strong>When we have a legal obligation to do so, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></div> How We Use Your Personal Data We use your personal data for the following purposes: Account & Registration We use your data to operate, support, and improve the Consumer Services you request, purchase, or engage with. This includes maintaining or servicing your accounts (including repairing errors that impair existing or intended functionality), providing customer service, processing transactions and payments, and verifying customer information. Personalization We use data to personalize your experience with our Consumer Services. These features often use automated processes to tailor Consumer Services based on the data we have about you or inferences based on your interests, location and whether separate devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, and/or TVs) are owned by you or by members of your household. You may also choose to provide us with access to your contact list so that we can help you to find your friends when using our apps (information from your contact list is not stored, shared or sold). Business Operations We use data to conduct ordinary business operations, verifying your identity, conducting business research, auditing, analytics, planning and strategy, corporate reporting, and management. Communications. We use data to communicate with you about our Consumer Services, such as responding to requests for support, sharing updates, and providing information required by law or applicable corporate updates related to mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures. Marketing & Advertising. We use data for different types of advertising, including the contextual customization of ads shown as part of your interaction with us. We also use data collected from your use of our Consumer Services and data from your engagement with apps and services provided by third parties to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your inferred interests, preferences, and locations. Rewards, Contests and Sweepstakes. We use data, including survey responses, administer rewards (i.e., give points for survey completion), contests, and sweepstakes. If you enter a sweepstakes, we will use data such as your name and email address to run the sweepstakes and fulfill prizes. Events. If you register for an event with us, we will add your contact information to our list of expected attendees. Research & Innovation Innovation is at the core of what we do. We conduct data analytics and use automated processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning to support internal research, create new products and services, improve functionality of existing products and services, and develop new features such as those developed to enhance security and protect privacy. Product & Service Development We use your data, along with inferences that we derive from your data, to offer products and services to developers, our partners and to our enterprise and other customers. These product and service offerings include the following: - When you opt-in to the collection and sharing of geolocation data from your mobile device, we use that data to create an inferred visit to a public location, which we call a "Visit." While Visits are associated with a mobile advertising identifier (or other identifier), to protect your privacy, we do not share your latitude and longitude coordinates, and we do not share inferred home and work locations. - We also help brands measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns by attributing purchases or other actions, such as a store visit, to their advertising by matching ad views to the data. As part of Attribution, we may also associate devices that we believe are related to each other. Audiences (Segments) - Using our Visits, along with inferences about your interests, location and other demographics that we derive from the data we have about you, including associated devices, we create "Audiences." Audiences are then used to send you advertisements tailored to your interests. As members of the NAI, we are required to disclose audiences or "segments" based on health-, wellness-, or political-related interests and information used to deliver interest-based advertisements in the U.S. For a list of our standard health and political segments, please click here . ggregated Products and Services - We also use data in an aggregated manner to power products and services that offer movement and location-based insights and trends. In addition, data is used to power Foursquare Studio which is a geospatial visual analytics platform that enables visualization of aggregated data. Points of Interest (POI) - POI data relates to physical places (restaurants, shops, airports, hotels, etc.) and is used to identify and provide context to points of interest worldwide. This data is typically not personal data. Security We use data to detect security threats (e.g., malware or other malicious activities), troubleshoot performance issues and to protect the security and safety of our products, systems, and customers. Our security measures may include the use of automated systems. Protect Our Rights & Property We use data to prevent fraud, identity theft, activities that violate our policies, terms of service, or the law, or to prevent other criminal activity that compromises our ability to protect our rights and property, secure our services, your data or the safety of our customers, employees and others. Comply With Law & Industry Standards We process data to comply with applicable laws, regulations, court orders or legally-binding requests from law enforcement, and relevant industry standards. For example, we must process your contact information to help you exercise your privacy rights. We also process data to conduct appropriate due diligence for compliance purposes. <div><h2>  <strong> DisclosingYour Personal Data </strong></h2><p>  We may disclose the categories of personal data we process about you (as described above) with third parties.
