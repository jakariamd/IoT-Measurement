Wurl Advertising Services Privacy Notice </h3></div> <div><h1>   Wurl Advertising Services Privacy Notice</h1><p>  <strong> Effective Date:  </strong>July 1, 2023</p><p>  EXHIBIT A – SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS FOR THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES</p><p>  <strong> Notice at Collection. </strong> At or before the time of collection, California residents may have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the categories of personal information to be collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is sold or shared and how to opt-out of such uses, and how long such information is retained. You can find those details by clicking on the above links.</p></div> <div><h2>  1. SCOPE</h2><p>  This Privacy Notice applies to personal information processed by Wurl, Inc. and WURL NETWORK UK, LTD (“<strong> Wurl </strong>,” “<strong> we </strong>,” “<strong> us </strong>,” and “<strong> our </strong>”) through our performance marketing services or supply-side platform (SSP) services (our “<strong> Advertising Services </strong>”).</p></div> <div><h2>  2. ABOUT WURL’S ADVERTISING SERVICES</h2><p>  <strong> Overview: </strong> Wurl provides a supply-side platform to publishers of online video content (i.e., Internet delivered video content) and a demand-side platform to buyers of digital advertising inventory displayed on online video content (i.e., advertisements/commercials displayed during the viewing of Internet delivered video content). Wurl’s Advertising Services help its publisher and advertiser clients achieve their monetization and advertising goals.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> How it works: </strong>When a publisher that offers online video content wants to provide video advertisements to viewers of its content, it can work with supply-side platforms (e.g., Wurl) to reach potential advertisers. To do this, the publisher of this video content (which could be a streaming app or a channel/content provider within a streaming app) will share certain device level data about the device with the supply-side platforms when someone is viewing the publisher’s video content. The supply-side platforms then make this device level data available to demand-side platforms (e.g., Wurl and other demand-side platforms) in the form of “bid requests” (i.e., a request to bid on displaying an advertisement to the viewer of online video content).</p></p> <p><p>  Once a demand-side platform receives a bid request, it will help its advertiser clients decide how much to bid on displaying an advertisement based on a variety of factors.</p></p> <p><p>  When an advertiser has the highest bid to display an advertisement, it will win the bid request and video content viewer will see the advertiser’s advertisement displayed on the device.</p></p> <div><h2>  3. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2><p>  <u> A Quick Note </u> Before we describe the types of information collected by the Advertising Services, it is important to understand that all information processed by the Advertising Services is solely at the device level and cannot, by itself, be used to identify a natural person in the real world. However, certain privacy and data protection laws still consider this device level data to be “personal information” which is why we use this terminology in our Privacy Notice.</p></div> <div><p>  Below are the types of information which may be collected by the Advertising Services:</p><p>  <strong> Bid Request Data.  </strong>When Wurl receives a bid-request from one of its publisher clients or another supply-side platform, we collect device level data contained in the bid-request which may include:</p><ul>  <li>An advertising ID or similar device ID about the device that is consuming online video content;</li><li>Details about the video content being viewed;</li><li>Details about the device such as the TV make and model;</li><li>Details about the application on the device through which the video content is being viewed;</li><li>Details about the user supplied permissions associated with the bid request (e.g., user opt out or consent preferences);</li><li>Country, time zone, and locale settings (country and preferred language);</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>City- and/or country-level geolocation data; and</li><li>IP address.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Data Collected by Wurl’s Advertiser Clients.  </strong>Wurl’s advertiser clients may provide us with device level data that they have collected about users of their services. This information provides insight into interests of our advertiser client’s users. Wurl uses this information to create models that help the advertiser client determine what sort of users it should target with advertisements and how much it should spend on advertisements. Wurl is a “processor” or “third-party” of event data and may only use this data in accordance with our advertiser client’s written instructions.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Impression Data.  </strong>When an advertiser client wins a bid and has its advertisement displayed on the device to the viewer of video content, Wurl may collect information in connection with delivering the ad including ad viewing and usage data through the use of beacons or pixels.</p></p> <div><h2>  4. HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>  We use personal information for a variety of business purposes, including: </p><span>  (i) to perform and provide the Advertising Services, (ii) for Wurl’s product development, implementation, and improvement purposes, and (iii) for pursuing legitimate interests, such as marketing, fraud prevention, quality control, and security. </span></div> <div><h2>  5. HOW WE DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>  We may share personal information with the following categories of third parties:</p><p>  <strong> Supply-Side Platforms and Demand-Side Platforms. </strong> Where we act as a supply-side platform on behalf of our publisher clients, we may share bid request data and data about impressions served with other supply-side platforms and demand-side platforms so that they, or parties they work with, can bid on and deliver advertisements.</p><p>  Any personal information we provide to the supply-side platform and/or the demand-side platform will also be subject to such party’s privacy policy (and potentially the privacy policy of other third-party recipients that they disclose personal information to). Supply-side platforms, demand-side platforms, and any third parties they work with are not our service providers or subprocessors. We are not responsible for the processing of personal information by supply-side platforms, demand-side platforms, and/or any third parties they work with.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Advertiser Clients.  </strong>If we, acting as a demand-side platform, deliver an advertisement to a viewer of video content on behalf of an advertiser client, we may share information related to that transaction with our advertiser client. Any personal information we provide to the advertiser client will also be subject to the advertiser client’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the advertiser client’s processing of personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Service Providers.  </strong>We may share any personal information we collect about you with our third-party service providers that help us provide the Advertising Services.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Affiliates.  </strong>We may share personal information with Wurl’s affiliated entities.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Disclosures to Protect Us or Others. </strong>We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store in association with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iii) enforce our policies or contracts; (iv) collect amounts owed to us; or (v) assist with an investigation and prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfer.  </strong>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.</p></p> <div><h2>  6. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2><p>  All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States and other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.</p><p>  If we transfer personal information which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.</p></div> <p><p>  For more information about the safeguards we use for international transfers of your personal information, please contact us as set forth below.</p></p> <div><h2>  7. YOUR CHOICES</h2><p>  You may be able to limit the collection and/or use of your personal information by Wurl and other supply-side and demand-side platforms involved in the Advertising Services by adjusting your preferences as your device or application permits or by contacting us as set forth in “Contact Us” below.

YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2><p>  <strong> Your Privacy Rights </strong>. In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Confirm Whether We Are Processing Your Personal Information  </strong>(the right to know);</li><li><strong> Request Access to and Portability of Your Personal Information </strong>, including: (i) obtaining access to or a copy of your personal information; and (ii) receiving an electronic copy of personal information that you have provided to us, or asking us to send that information to another company in a structured, commonly used, and machine readable format (also known as the “right of data portability”);</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Request Correction  </strong>of your personal information where it is inaccurate or incomplete. In some cases, we may provide self-service tools that enable you to update your personal information;</li><li><strong> Request Deletion  </strong>of your personal information;</li><li><strong> Request to Opt-Out of Certain Processing Activities  </strong>including, as applicable, if we process your personal information for “targeted advertising” (as “targeted advertising” is defined by applicable privacy laws), if we “sell” your personal information (as “sell” is defined by applicable privacy laws), or if we engage in “profiling” in furtherance of certain “decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects” concerning you (as such terms are defined by applicable
privacy laws);</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Request Restriction of or Object to  </strong>ourprocessing of your personal information; and</li><li><strong> Withdraw your Consent </strong>to our processing of your personal information.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth in “<a href="#15" target="_blank"> Contact Us </a>” below. We will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.</p></p> <p><p>  To protect your privacy, we will take steps to reasonably verify your identity before fulfilling requests submitted under applicable privacy laws. These steps may involve asking you to provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</p></p> <p><p>  Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf in certain jurisdictions, may make a request to exercise the rights listed above regarding your personal information. If your personal information is subject to a law that allows an authorized agent to act on your behalf in exercising your privacy rights and you wish to designate an authorized agent, please provide written authorization signed by you and your designated agent using the information found in “Contact Us” below and ask us for additional instructions.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that we are unable to authenticate any individuals whose device level data we receive from publishers of online video content and/or other supply-side partners. As a result, we may not be able to fulfill data subject requests that we receive.</p></p> <p><p>  Some laws may allow you to appeal our decision if we decline to process your request. If applicable laws grant you an appeal right and you would like to appeal our decision with respect to your request, you may do so by informing us of this and providing us with information supporting your appeal.</p></p> <p><p>  If your personal information is subject to the applicable data protection laws of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your personal information violates applicable law.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>EEA Data Protection Authorities (DPAs)</li><li>Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC)</li><li>UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  9. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>  We store the personal information we receive as described in this Privacy Notice for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Advertising Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.</p><p>  To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, certain risk factors, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.</p></div> <div><h2>  10. SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h2><p>  This Supplemental Notice for California Residents supplements our Privacy Notice and only applies to our processing of personal information that is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended from time to time) (“<strong> CCPA </strong>”).</p><p>  The CCPA provides California residents with the right to know what categories of personal information Wurl has collected about them whether Wurl disclosed that personal information for a business purpose (e.g., to a service provider), whether Wurl “sold” that personal information, and whether Wurl “shared” that personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising” in the preceding twelve months. California residents can find this information below:</p></div> <div><td>  <strong> Category of Personal Information Collected by Wurl </strong></td><td>  <strong> Categories of Third Parties Personal Information is Disclosed to for a Business Purpose </strong></td><td>  <strong> Identifiers </strong></td><td>  · Demand-side platforms</td><td>  · Advertiser clients

We will retain personal information in accordance with the time periods set forth in “Retention of Personal Information.”</p></div> <p><p>  Under the CCPA, there is uncertainty regarding what may be (1) a “sale” of personal information and/or (2) “sharing” personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising.” For example, it is unclear whether or not a Wurl’s disclosure of bid request data to supply-side and/or demand-side platforms is a “sale” of personal information. To the extent Wurl’s processing of personal information is considered “selling” or “sharing”, we “sell” and “share” your personal information to provide you with “cross-context behavioral advertising” about products and services that may be of interest you.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Additional Privacy Rights for California Residents </strong></p><p>  <strong> Opting Out of “Sales” of Personal Information and/or “Sharing” for Cross-Context Behavioral  </strong><strong> Advertising under the CCPA </strong>. California residents have the right to opt out of the “sale” of personal information and the “sharing” of personal information for “cross-context behavioral advertising.” To the extent Wurl’s processing of personal information is considered “selling” or “sharing”, California residents may exercise these rights by contacting us as set forth in “Contact Us” below.</p></div> <p><p>  For more details about how to manage your preferences on some Internet connected TVs, read the instructions found here. In addition, you may opt-out of personalized advertisements on some mobile applications by following the instructions for Android, iOS and others.

personal information via the Advertising Services.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Non-Discrimination.  </strong>California residents have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of their rights conferred by the CCPA.</p></p> <div><h2>  11. SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS</h2><p>  If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of certain personal information to third parties who intend to license or sell that personal information.
