</span><p>  The core of the solution is a robust Error Correction (FEC) based pro-active distributed storage algorithm, coupled with fast and extremely robust UDP based data restoration and delivery protocol that can restore data from multiple sources simultaneously with very low latency.</p><p>  Distributed Adaptive Storage & Streaming™ (DASS) – A robust distributed and secure cloud technology, leveraging the universal presence of existing or new storage nodes and infinite fragments of storage and bandwidth resources they can provide, together with sophisticated distributed data storage and security algorithms.</p></div> <div><h3>  Technology:</h3><span>  
 </span><p>  FEC Based Encoding
</p><p>  Redundancy and High Availability are integrated into the data itself, eliminating reliance on replication of data on the network.</p><span>  
 </span><p>  5 layers of security for data protection and access restriction
</p><p>  AES256, FEC obfuscation, encryption on remote storage node with client key, each processing layer validated by hashes of sha256.</p><span>  
 </span><p>  Pro-Active Storage™
</p><p>  Patented technology that pro-actively pre-populates encoded and resilient data fragments in any storage node - on prem, in the cloud, or hybrid, and enables high availability of content from any storage node or devices.</p></div> <div><span>  
 </span><p>  Automatic Data Healing
</p><p>  Provisioning of data availability by self-healing of data across the network. If any storage node might go offline, DASS healing automatically monitors the network and creates more sources and data inventory, on the fly, for every required fragment of data.</p><span>  
 </span><p>  Asynchronous Coded Multi-Source Streaming 
</p><p>  Patented UDP based data transfer and streaming protocol, providing "Netflix like" video and gaming streaming capabilities, which can obtain data in random order from dozens of sources simultaneously and assemble media on-the-fly in asynchronous order.</p></div> <div><span>  
 </span><p>  Cross-Platform and Low Footprint
</p><p>  Interoperability and operation on any OS and device. Low CPU, RAM and disk usage, can be implemented on high end servers or on low end IoT end points.</p><span>  
 </span><p>  Network Operator Friendly
</p><p>  Off-peak load balancing leverages excess & idle bandwidth, work load & geo-optimized data retrieval.</p><span>
