In other words, we are responsible for deciding how to collect, use, share, and disclose this information.</p><p>  The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Union ("<strong> EU </strong>") require companies to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using, sharing, or disclosing your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Contractual Commitments: </em> We may use, share, or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you.

We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.  The purposes for which we use information may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, if you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request. To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional time period of time.</p></div> <div><h3>  How We Protect Your Information</h3><p>  We take the security and privacy of your data very seriously.

In some cases, you may also be presented with a form field to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. </p></p> <p><p>  Please note that if you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable law (in the locations required).</p></p> <p><p>  In addition to the rights and choices identified above with respect to specific jurisdictions, you have certain rights and choices with respect to your information such as:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Marketing Communications: </em> You can decline promotional communications at the point information is requested for such purpose on our Website (e.g., by checking or un-ticking (as directed) the relevant box) or, by following the unsubscribe instructions on communications sent to you.

We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We retain your information as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect it, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.  Different processing purposes may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  For example, if you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.    </p></p> <div><h3>  Notice to EU and Other Non-U.S. Residents</h3><p>  Our Website is operated in the United States.
