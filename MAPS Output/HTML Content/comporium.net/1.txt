If you forget your PIN, contact your system administrator.</p><p>  When you have a PIN, the policy may be set up with a feature to lock users out if they do not enter the correct PIN.  The system administrator configures the PIN lock setting so that if someone attempts to log on to a device with an incorrect password more than the configured number of attempts, a locally initiated wipe of the device is performed. This erases all data on the device. The policy settings are configured only by the administrator and cannot be modified by users.  Ask your system administrator for more information.</p></div> <div><p>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
