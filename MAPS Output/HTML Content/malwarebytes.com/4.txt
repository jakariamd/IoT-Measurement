As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate, and/or other metadata associated with your machine and usage activities and anonymously generated device identifiers and administer the site. </p></p> <div><h3>  Simply</h3><p>  There are two types of information we collect: personal and non-personal.</p></div> <div><h2>  Software Collection – information collected when using our security software</h2></div> <div><h3>  User-Agent String</h3><p>  Each API communication coming from any of our client software identifies itself with a string that includes information about the software itself:</p><ul>  <li>The program and build which is sending the request</li><li>The current license state (as identified by the product)</li><li>The version of the software as well as any subcomponents (currently, databases) that it uses</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So we can manage your Malwarebytes product and ensure that it is up to date.</p></div> <div><h3>  GeoIP Data</h3><p>  When we collect data from our client systems, we do not store IP address from which the request originates. . However, we do use it to gather geographic information on the system calling in: </p><ul>  <li>A location item indicating the continent, country, city, and approximate latitude/ longitude of the user based on your IP address</li><li>The type of connection (dialup/broadband/satellite/mobile)</li><li>The ISP through which the connection is made </li><li>The organization to which the IP address is licensed, if any</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So our malware intelligence team can track malware and potentially unwanted program ("PUP") outbreaks and patterns.</p></div> <div><h3>  Functional Data</h3><p>  We collect data that is necessary for the functionality of the software or for our performance of providing the software to you. For example, we may need to collect system processes and behaviors in order to perform system rollback and recovery operations.</p></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So our products are able to function as intended, including being able to detect and remediate malware and PUPs, and provide rollback and recovery operations.</p></div> <div><h3>  Client Data</h3><p>  In addition to functional data, we collect client data from each program that describe the client environment (i.e., our software and the computer system it is running on). In this, we collect:</p><ul>  <li>The operating system the program is installed on </li><li>The system language in use on that system </li><li>The processor architecture (i.e., 32- or 64-bit)</li><li>The file system in use (i.e., FAT32)</li><li>Information from the Windows Security/Action Center, including security settings and programs installed or in use</li><li>Information about other Malwarebytes program settings and how they are configured</li><li>Information about how you use our software or services ("Log Data") including use of integrations with our products</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So we can gather performance data around our products and how they operate in relation to different hardware and software environments. By having this data, we can improve our products as well as optimize them for the various system configurations that our users are using.</p></div> <div><h3>  Machine Identification Data</h3><p>  We identify each system by assigning each system with a Malwarebytes-generated distinct identifier that is created at install time.</p></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So we are able to get an accurate count of our install base. We are also able to identify changes to an individual system over time, allowing us to recognize trends which are used for improving our products.</p></div> <div><h3>  License Data</h3><p>  We collect data from products corresponding to the products' applicable license state. These data also use a unique identifier. In this, we collect:</p><ul>  <li>The key or keys used to license the current product </li><li>The type of license being used </li><li>If it represents a console system, the number of seats being managed by that installation of the console</li><li>Endpoint and network domain information</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So we can remind you when your Malwarebytes subscription is about to expire or to determine the correct license type. We may use such license data in conjunction with other software collection to assist you in resolving licensing issues.</p></div> <div><h3>  Malware and PUP Data</h3><p>  We collect data about the malware and PUPs that are detected by our products. We collect:</p><ul>  <li>The vendor name of the malware or PUP removed </li><li>An encrypted description of which database rule was used to remove the malware or PUP in question</li><li>Artifacts detected as malware, PUPs, or suspicious files</li><li>Information related to detected artifacts</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So our malware intelligence team can track malware and PUP outbreaks and improve the efficacy of Malwarebytes products.</p></div> <div><h3>  Trial Data</h3><p>  When a client attempts to start a trial, we track it remotely in order to validate that the trial is allowed. For this information we use another unique system identifier. We collect:</p><ul>  <li>The client's request for a trial </li><li>The start date and duration of the trial provided </li><li>Any attempted conversion/purchase generated by clicking an in-app link, so that it can be correlated with a trial</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So we can update your Malwarebytes products accurately and when they need it.</p></div> <div><h3>  Exploit Data</h3><p>  In Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit products we collect a complex data object for any exploit process which is blocked by the software. In this data we collect:</p><ul>  <li>Process ID of the exploit process </li><li>File path of exploit process </li><li>MD5 hash of the exploit payload, if any</li><li>Command-line arguments passed to the exploit</li><li>A list of URLs potentially associated with the exploit, including redirect jumps if any </li><li>Exploit payload files </li><li>Exploit file-format (doc, pdf, xls, etc…)</li><li>(Potentially) a copy of the exploit executable itself</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So our malware intelligence team can track exploit outbreaks and deepen its understanding of new exploit techniques.</p></div> <div><h3>  Operating System User Account Name and Domain</h3><p>  In certain Malwarebytes business products providing brute-force attack protection, we collect user account names and domain information.</p></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So that you (as the customer) can see what credentials are being targeted during brute-force attacks.</p></div> <div><h3>  Port number(s) used for incoming connections.</h3><p>  In certain Malwarebytes business products providing brute-force attack protection, we collect user account names and domain information associated with connections to network port numbers, including, but not limited to, those associated with: remote desktop protocol, FTP, SQL, IMAP, POP3, SMTP.</p></div> <div><h3>  Why?</h3><p>  So that you (as the customer) can see what ports are being used for connections by different protocols, and improve our products.</p></div> <div><h3>  Mobile Application Data</h3><p>  When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the unique device identifier. </p><p>  We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</p></div> <p><p>  We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile Apps or Services.</p></p> <p><p>  We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p></p> <p><p>  As part of our text message filtering functionality, our Mobile Software also collects text messages from senders who are not in your contacts, and analyzes these text messages to determine whether they are malicious. We only receive the sender information and the body of the message which is analyzed to determine if they contain malicious URLs or come from malicious senders; no information is provided about the recipient.
