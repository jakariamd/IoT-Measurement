This personal information may be combined or linked with other information held about you, including information we receive from third parties and partners. We have taken a number of physical, electronic and procedural steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure including by means of firewalls, password access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.</p></div> <p><p>  If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information, please let us know immediately.</p></p> <p><p>  We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our Services and/or to manage your Account.

There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.

We may also decline aspects of deletion or access requests if we believe doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for safety, integrity and security purposes as described earlier.</p></p> <p><p>  We may retain information as required or permitted by applicable laws and regulations (e.g. in accordance with the Act), including for our billing or records purposes, to comply with your choices under your Account settings, and to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
