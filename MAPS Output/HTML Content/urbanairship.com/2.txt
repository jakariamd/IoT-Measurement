What Are Your Rights Under CCPA? </strong></p></p> <div><p>  The CCPA gives California residents the following rights:</p><p>  <strong> 2.1 Right to Know and Access Personal Information </strong></p><p>  You (or your authorized representative) can request a copy of your Personal Information. Under CCPA, you can also request that we disclose how we have collected, used, and disclosed your Personal Information over the past 12 months, including the categories of Personal Information we collected and our purposes for doing so; the categories of sources for that information; the categories of third parties with whom we shared it or disclosed it for a business purpose and our purposes for doing so. Companies that sell Personal Information (we do not) must make additional disclosures.</p></div> <p><p>  You can submit your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@airship.com" target="_blank"> privacy@airship.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.2 Your Right to Opt Out of Sales </strong></p></p> <p><p>  California residents are able to direct a business that sells Personal Information to stop selling that information. Children under the age of 16 must provide opt in consent, with a parent or guardian required to consent for children under 13. Please note that Airship’s Services are not marketed to or intended for minors under the age of 18. We do not sell Personal Information for monetary consideration. In addition, we do not “sell” Personal Information of individuals we know to be under the age of 16.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.3 Your Right to Opt Out of Sharing </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Under the CCPA, you can opt out of the sharing of your Personal Information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes. Like many companies, Airship uses services that employ cookies and other technologies to collect Personal Information (including the identifiers and internet activity information described in the table above) about your use of our Services, which helps us to deliver targeted ads. Our use of some of these services may constitute the “sharing” of Personal Information as defined under the CCPA to/with third party advertisers. You can direct us not to share your Personal Information as described in Section 4 here below (What CCPA Categories of Personal Information Do We “Share”). The following categories of Personal Data have been shared in the preceding 12 months with third party advertising partners and advertising technology providers so that we can reach you with advertisements for our products and services and make them more relevant to you: identifiers and contact information; and analytics or other electronic network activity. In addition, we do not share Personal Information of individuals we know to be under the age of 16 for cross-context-behavioral advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.4 Your Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Under the CCPA, you can limit a business’s use and disclosure of your sensitive Personal Information to certain purposes specified by law (e.g., providing you with services you request or preventing fraud, or for other purposes that don’t involve deriving your attributes). We only use sensitive Personal Information for such permitted purposes, so we don’t have an opt-out.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.5 Your Right to Notification </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Under the CCPA, a business like Airship cannot collect new categories of Personal Information or use them for materially different purposes without first notifying you.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.6 Right of No Retaliation for Exercising Your CCPA Rights </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Such discrimination may include denying services, charging different prices or rates for services, providing a different level or quality of services, or suggesting that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services as a result of exercising your rights.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.7 Your Right to Correct Inaccurate Personal Information </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You can request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@airship.com" target="_blank"> privacy@airship.com </a> or updating our information in the Airship Platform to the extent such request related to Personal Information tied to your Airship Platform account information.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are an Airship customer seeking to correct Personal Information regarding your End User, then Airship makes certain functionalities available in the Airship Platform for correction.

What CCPA Categories of Personal Information Do We Disclose for a “Business Purpose”? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The CCPA requires us to describe the “business purposes” for which we may disclose your Personal Information. As described in our <a href="https://www.airship.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank"> Privacy Statement </a> in <strong> Sections 3 </strong> (How does Airship use Personal Information and what are the legal bases for these uses?) and  (With whom does Airship share Personal Information?), we collect, retain, use and disclose your Personal Information to support our own operational purposes in providing our Services to you and for one or more of the following business purposes:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Providing information and services you requested</li><li>Processing interactions and transactions</li><li>Managing interactions and Ttransactions</li><li>Marketing products and services</li><li>Recruitment and employment as described in <a href="https://www.airship.com/legal/california-employee-and-candidate-privacy-notice/" target="_blank"> Airship’s California Employee Privacy Notice </a></li><li>Performing services</li><li>Quality & safety assurance, verification, maintenance, improvement, or enhancement</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Security & integrity, including (without limitation) protecting against security incidents and fraudulent, malicious, illegal, or wrongful conduct</li><li>Debugging</li><li>Short-term, transient use, including non-personalized advertising</li><li>Enabling our service providers and business partners (and their service providers and/or subcontractors) to provide services to us</li><li>Complying with legal obligations</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 4. What CCPA Categories of Personal Information Do We “Share”? </strong></p></p> <p><p>  As is common among businesses that operate internet websites, we may disclose the following categories of Personal Information in a way that could be deemed a “sharing” of data for cross-context behavioral advertising under California law: certain identifiers, internet & other electronic network activity information, and inferences. “Sharing” is broadly defined as disclosing personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is defined to include instances where companies target advertising based on personal information obtained from a consumer’s activity across distinctly-branded websites or services. We do not share sensitive Personal Information.</p></p> <p><p>  You may opt out of “sharing” by visiting our Cookie Consent Manager or by enabling Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) in your web browser or browser extension, which we recognize to the extent required by applicable law, adjust your preferences in the cookies consent manager banner as described in the <a href="https://www.airship.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank"> Privacy Statement Section 11 </a> (Your privacy rights. Opt-out of cookies and ads.), or by emailing us at privacy@airship.com. Enabling GPC will automatically set your cookie settings to opt out of the sharing of Personal Information for behavioral advertising. If you choose to use GPC, you will need to turn it on for each supported browser or browser extension you use. Other than GPC, Airship does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or a mobile device.
