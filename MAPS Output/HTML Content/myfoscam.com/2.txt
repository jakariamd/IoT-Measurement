				provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall

			</p></div> <div><h3>  COPYRIGHT DISPUTE POLICY</h3><p>  
				FOSCAM has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital
				Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA (posted at www.lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf). The address
				of FOSCAM's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement ("Designated Agent") is listed
				at the end of this Section. It is FOSCAM's policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes
				in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our
				advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to
				repeat offenders.
			</p></div> <p><p>  
				Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements: If you believe that material or content residing on or
				accessible through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement
				containing all of the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:
			</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
						A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the
						copyright that has been allegedly infringed;
					</li><li>
						Identification of works or materials being infringed;
					</li><li>
						Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the
						location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient
						detail so that FOSCAM is capable of finding and verifying its existence;
					</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
						Contact information about the notifier, including address, telephone number and, if available, email
						address;
					</li><li>
						A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not
						authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
					</li><li>
						A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the
						notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.
					</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
				Once proper bona fide infringement notification is received by the Designated Agent, it is FOSCAM's policy:
			</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
						to remove or disable access to the infringing material;
					</li><li>
						to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the
						material; and
					</li><li>
						that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that FOSCAM will
						terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the Services.
					</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</h3><ul>  <li>
						If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which
						access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has
						the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or,
						pursuant to the law, the content provider, member, or user, may send a counter-notice containing the
						following information to the Designated Agent listed below:
					</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;</li><li>
						Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the
						location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
					</li><li>
						A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was
						removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and Content
						provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address,
						and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the
						judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or, if the
						content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any
						judicial district in which FOSCAM is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of
						process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
					</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
				If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, FOSCAM may send a copy of the counter-notice to the
				original complaining party informing that person that FOSCAM may replace the removed material or cease
				disabling it in 10 to 14 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order
				against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored
				in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at FOSCAM's discretion.
