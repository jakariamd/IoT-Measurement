<div><h1>  UNPKG</h1><p>  unpkg is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank"> npm </a>. Use it to quickly and easily load any file from any package using a URL like:</p></div> <div><h3>  Examples</h3><p>  Using a fixed version:</p><p>  You may also use a <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver" target="_blank"> semver range </a> or a <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag" target="_blank"> tag </a> instead of a fixed version number, or omit the version/tag entirely to use the  tag.</p><p>  If you omit the file path (i.e. use a “bare” URL), unpkg will serve the file specified by the  field in , or fall back to .</p><p>  Append a  at the end of a URL to view a listing of all the files in a package.</p></div> <div><h3>  Query Parameters</h3></div> <div><h3>  Cache Behavior</h3><p>  The CDN caches files based on their permanent URL, which includes the npm package version. This works because npm does not allow package authors to overwrite a package that has already been published with a different one at the same version number.</p><p>  Browsers are instructed (via the  header) to cache assets indefinitely (1 year).</p><p>  URLs that do not specify a package version number redirect to one that does. This is the  version when no version is specified, or the  version when a <a href="https://github.com/npm/node-semver" target="_blank"> semver version </a> is given. Redirects are cached for 10 minutes at the CDN, 1 minute in browsers.</p></div> <p><p>  If you want users to be able to use the latest version when you cut a new release, the best policy is to put the version number in the URL directly in your installation instructions. This will also load more quickly because we won't have to resolve the latest version and redirect them.</p></p> <div><h3>  Workflow</h3><p>  For npm package authors, unpkg relieves the burden of publishing your code to a CDN in addition to the npm registry. All you need to do is include your <a href="https://github.com/umdjs/umd" target="_blank"> UMD </a> build in your npm package (not your repo, that's different!).</p><p>  You can do this easily using the following setup:</p><ul>  <li>Add the  (or ) directory to your  file</li><li>Add the  directory to your <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files" target="_blank"> files array </a> in </li><li>Use a build script to generate your UMD build in the  directory when you publish</li></ul></div> <p><p>  That's it! Now when you  you'll have a version available on unpkg as well.</p></p> <div><h3>  About</h3><p>  unpkg is an <a href="https://github.com/mjackson/unpkg" target="_blank"> open source </a> project built and maintained by <a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson" target="_blank"> Michael Jackson </a>. unpkg is not affiliated with or supported by npm, Inc. in any way.
