</li><li><b> What is Ad Replacement? </b> 
Ad Replacement is a new privacy control that allows users to determine whether they would like to receive tailored ads on your SmartCast TV for linear programming (broadcasting) content via cable, satellite and set-top boxes is showing. This means that when Ad Replacement is enabled, people watching the same programming on different VIZIO SmartCast TVs may see different ads. 

</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><b> How does Ad Replacement work? </b>Ad Replacement technology, also known as Dynamic Ad Insertion (“DAI”), allows broadcasters, programmers, and advertisers to replace generic ads with tailored ads while you are watching linear programming (broadcasting). Ad Replacement is for linear programming and ONLY works if Ad Replacement is enabled.

</li><li><b> What happens when Ad Replacement is enabled? </b>When Ad Replacement is ON, broadcasters, programmers and advertisers may replace generic ads with tailored ads while you are watching linear programming (broadcasting). This means that when Ad Replacement is enabled, people watching the same programming on different VIZIO SmartCast TVs may see different ads.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><b> What happens if Ad Replacement is disabled </b>? 
When Ad Replacement is OFF, the VIZIO SmartCast TV will show generic ads when you are viewing linear programming via cable, satellite, and set-top boxes. You will still see ads, but the ads will not be tailored. 

</li><li><b> How do I turn on/off Ad Replacement </b>?
You can toggle Ad Replacement on or off in the Settings menu of your VIZIO unit.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <b> SmartCast TVs after 2020 </b>:

If you would like to opt-out of these tailored ads, you can choose to turn ON the Limit Ad Tracking setting on your SmartCast TV.

</li><li><b> What happens if “Limit Ad Tracking” is in the ON position? </b>VIZIO’s advertising platform will not serve tailored ads to your SmartCast TV. You will still see advertisements when you use SmartCast Home or stream apps, but they may be less relevant to you.

If you reset the TV Ad ID on your Smart TV, the current TV Ad ID will be replaced with a new one. The old TV Ad ID will no longer be linked to your VIZIO Smart TV, so any data collected and associated with the previous TV Ad ID will no longer be used to deliver tailored ads to your VIZIO Smart TV.

</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Will I still receive tailored ads if I reset my TV Ad ID </b>? 
Yes, but the ads will not be tailored based on data collected and associated with your TV before you reset the TV Ad ID. Ads will be tailored based on data collected <i> after  </i>you rest the TV Ad ID.
