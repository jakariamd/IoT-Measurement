In addition, through our data licensing group, we also license Viewing Data to analytics companies, media companies, advertisers, ad agencies, and other ad technology companies who measure ad effectiveness or aid personalization of ads, through written agreements which strictly prohibit attempts at identification or re-identification of shared information. Viewing Data is used for the purposes listed below:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><i> Summary Analytics and Reports.  </i> VIZIO's select data partners analyze Viewing Data to create summary reports to help deliver relevant information and advertising to interested groups of consumers.  These summary reports are built from automated analysis of data elements, without connecting the information to any known natural person.  For example, a data partner who is an advertiser may want to measure the effectiveness of their promotions, in the aggregate.  Thus, the data partner may identify another device that shares an IP address with the VIZIO TV or display and analyze: (a) whether a particular website was viewed or commercial location was visited by a device with location tracking enabled (e.g., a smartphone) after a related promotion was viewed, and (b) whether a particular program was viewed following exposure to a promotion for that program.  In addition, some data partners are authorized to use a third-party data aggregator to identify demographic or other attributes or traits (such as gender or age range or income range or behavioral data) associated with the IP addresses that VIZIO collects, and then send to the data partners the demographic information associated with those addresses.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><i> Audience Measurement. </i> VIZIO and select data partners may use Viewing Data to understand what customers watch in order to deliver more relevant content and advertising, for example, by determining which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, and whether and how often people watch commercials.  VIZIO and select data partners may also combine Viewing Data with other demographic and similar information, including by working with data aggregators.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><i> Tailored Advertisements. </i> VIZIO also licenses Viewing Data to select data partners for the purpose of targeting and tailoring the advertising you see on your VIZIO Smart TV or across various VIZIO and third-party platforms or devices, including other devices associated with your IP Address, device ID, email address or VIZIO account on the basis of your Viewing Data. VIZIO or its data partners are sometimes authorized to enhance Viewing Data with household demographic data and data about digital actions (e.g., digital purchases, location, and other consumer behavior taken by devices associated with the IP Address VIZIO collects), for the purpose of delivering relevant advertising that are likely to be useful or timely, including during broadcast, cable, satellite, or internet based television programming.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  VIZIO does not permit external data partners to combine or associate the Viewing Data with any information that will result in the Viewing Data becoming identifiable to individual persons.  VIZIO may combine information (including Activity Data and/or Viewing Data) collected by VIZIO with other information (including information that you may provide to us such as your email address or your VIZIO account) so that VIZIO can provide you with a more personalized experience on your VIZIO Smart TV or display (for example, by recommending content) as well as to market and improve VIZIO's products and services – such as by enhancing popular product functionality and by modifying services to better meet VIZIO's customers’ needs. VIZIO may also match your data with VIZIO’s partners’ data to help market VIZIO's products or services to you and provide advertising tailored to your individual interests based on your viewing history or how you browse and shop online.  If you opt-in to Viewing Data, VIZIO will also email you targeted advertisements and personalized marketing emails based upon the Viewing Data, Activity Data and demographic or and other attribute information. You can change your email preferences at any time, in your VIZIO account settings or by following the instructions for unsubscribing in any marketing email message.</p></p> <p><p>  <i> Other Circumstances for Disclosing Information </i>. VIZIO will disclose information as required by law, or if any of the following applies in VIZIO's judgment:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>It is necessary to respond to lawful governmental requests or legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant, or subpoena).</li><li>The information is relevant to a crime that has been or is being committed.</li><li>An emergency exists that poses a threat to your safety or the safety of another person, or it is necessary to protect the rights or property of VIZIO or VIZIO's employees.</li><li>If the ownership of VIZIO, Inc. or an affiliate or their respective assets changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, information may be transferred to another company. That company may only use information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <i> SMS Vizio Texts </i>. All of the above excludes text messaging opt-in data and consent for the VIZIO Texts Service, which VIZIO does not share with third parties. However, VIZIO may share originator opt-in data and consent with VIZIO’s third party text messaging platform provider as may be necessary to send you VIZIO Texts under the VIZIO Texts SMS Terms of Use. VIZIO also reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or government request.</p></p> <p><p>  <i> International Transfers. </i>  VIZIO is a company headquartered in Irvine, California in the United States.  If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information VIZIO collects may be processed and transferred to the United States and be subject to U.S. law.  By using VIZIO products and services or providing VIZIO with any information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance, and transfer of such information to and in the U.S.</p></p> <div><h1>  IV.

To do so, pair your own device with the VIZIO Smart TV or display and choose to proceed in the VIZIO Mobile App in guest mode.  In that circumstance, VIZIO will create a guest profile and deliver personalization of content and other VIZIO Mobile App features and functionality, but VIZIO will not associate your Activity Data or (when and if enabled) any Viewing Data with any VIZIO Account or user profile name.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><i> VIZIO Smart TV or Display. </i> Prior to collecting Activity Data, the VIZIO Smart TV applications will show a notification explaining the nature and purpose of the Activity Data collection, separate and apart from this Privacy Policy.</li><li><i> Disabling Automated Content Recognition ("ACR")/Viewing Data.   </i>Prior to enabling Viewing Data collection on your VIZIO Smart TV or display, VIZIO will request your express acknowledgment and acceptance.  Only upon acknowledgment and acceptance will VIZIO collect Viewing Data from your VIZIO Smart TV or display.  Each unit will receive a notification, explaining the nature and purpose of the feature, separate and apart from this Privacy Policy. Viewing Data will only be collected from units that choose to "ACCEPT" to collection and use of Viewing Data. Thereafter, at that time, and any time after, you will have the option to change the setting for the ACR feature/Viewing Data collection off or on from the Settings menu of your VIZIO device. Turning if off will not affect the performance of your VIZIO device but will trigger the deletion of historical logs of Viewing Data for the device from VIZIO's data base.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><i> Opting-out of Tailored Advertising and Personalized Marketing </i>.  You can opt out of receiving Tailored Advertising and Personalized Marketing by reviewing your account settings and opting out in VIZIO Sites and Services.  Where applicable, you may also untick any opt in box or email <a href="mailto:privacy@vizio.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vizio.com </a> to opt-out and to update your marketing and communication preferences. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <b> Controlling the Collection of Viewing Data.  </b> For textual as well as graphical instructions on how to turn Viewing Data off or on, visit <a href="https://www.vizio.com/en/terms/privacy-policy/viewing-data-privacy-policy" target="_blank"> Viewing Data Supplement To The Privacy Policy </a>.  If you are unable to locate the Viewing Data setting on your VIZIO TV or display, contact VIZIO by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@vizio.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vizio.com </a>or calling (855) 472-8817.  Please note that if your TV or display is ever reset to factory settings, the device will return to its default settings, and Viewing Data will be reset to the "OFF" position.  You may again turn the feature on by following the procedure described above.</p></p> <p><p>  Turning the Viewing Data feature off or on will affect only the TV or display where you have made that selection.  When you turn off collection of Viewing Data (if it was previously turned on), logs of Viewing Data will be deleted from our database.</p></p> <p><p>  However, even if Viewing Data is turned off, information other than Viewing Data will still be collected from you when you separately provide such information, such as when you submit a support request or participate in a promotion and from other sources as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <i> REMINDER </i>: You always have the option to control the collection of Viewing Data in your TV or display's Settings menu. Viewing Data collection is only enabled if a user ACCEPTS this collection.  However, for a period of time you may continue to see tailored ads on other devices that were targeted on the basis of Viewing Data that was shared before you turned off collection.  Disabling the Video ACR (Viewing Data) feature in the Settings Menu will not, however, affect or limit Activity Data collection through VIZIO Smart Products, which is used to personalize and recommend content within the VIZIO Smart TV, display or VIZIO Mobile App. If you intend to sell or otherwise give away your VIZIO Smart TV or display, you should perform a "factory reset."  </p></p> <p><p>  <b> How You Can Access or Remove Information. </b> If you desire access to view, correct or remove information, please <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/41aebd10-58ee-4c98-9dd5-aa66c9be664a/0099df9c-c0aa-4bf7-bd5f-7f4ff46768f6.html" target="_blank"> fill out our Privacy Web Form </a> or call (855) 472-8817.  If you request removal of personal information, you acknowledge that residual information may continue to reside in VIZIO's records and archives, but VIZIO will not use that information going forward for commercial purposes. VIZIO reserves the right to maintain information if VIZIO has suspended, limited, or terminated your access to the VIZIO site or VIZIO products and services for violating any applicable Terms of Use or Terms of Service. This paragraph does not apply to information that cannot be reasonably used to identify you. VIZIO reserves the right to refuse to process data removal requests that are impractical or jeopardize the privacy of others.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are a California resident, <a href="https://www.vizio.com/en/terms/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-addendum-for-ca-residents" target="_blank"> learn more </a> about the privacy controls available to you.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are a Virginia resident, <a href="https://www.vizio.com/en/terms/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-addendum-for-va-residents" target="_blank"> learn more </a> about the privacy controls available to you.</p></p> <div><h1>  V. Other Practices</h1><p>  <i> How Long VIZIO Stores the Information Collected </i>. VIZIO will retain information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine VIZIO's retention periods include: (i) the length of time VIZIO has an ongoing relationship with the customer and provide VIZIO's products and services; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which VIZIO is subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of VIZIO's legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations). Please note that if or when you turn off collection of Viewing Data (if it was previously turned on), logs of Viewing Data will be deleted from our database.</p></div> <p><p>  <i> How VIZIO Protects the Information Collected </i>. VIZIO uses reasonable and appropriate measures designed and maintained to safeguard information within VIZIO's organization.  Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  To help protect your information, we recommend consumers follow best practices for internet activities, including proactive password management and router security protocols</p></p> <p><p>  <i> Handling of Minors' Data.  </i>VIZIO recognizes that parents, guardians, or other adults often purchase VIZIO's products for family use, including use by minors. VIZIO will not knowingly sell information from children under age 16 for any purpose nor will VIZIO knowingly accept account or device registration from them.  In some cases, particularly where information is collected electronically, VIZIO may not be able to know whether information was collected from a child under age 16. VIZIO treats this information as though it were provided by an adult.  However, if VIZIO learns that it has collected information of a child under age 16, VIZIO will attempt to delete that information as soon as possible and take any other measures required under applicable law.</p></p> <div><h1>  VI. VIZIOgram Feature for Mobile Application and Smart TV</h1><p>  VIZIO Account holders may choose to activate a photo and video sharing feature available for the VIZIO Mobile App and on VIZIO Smart TVs, called VIZIOgram. This feature allows sharing of content, between registered VIZIO Account holders only and on VIZIO Smart TVs only. As the creator of content to be shared, you control which users can access it. You can remove connections who can access your content at any time.</p><p>  The account holder can select photos or videos to upload from a smartphone or tablet to VIZIOgram, via the VIZIOgram feature within the VIZIO Mobile App. As part of the feature, we store uploaded photos, videos, and related metadata (the “VIZIOgram Content”) in the cloud, temporarily (i.e., for 30 days from the date of upload), so that the receiving account holder can view images or videos communicated through the service. As shared and stored, photos or video files themselves may also have additional metadata generated by the user or the device, such as file names; text comments or labels; or the time, date, and geographical location of the photos or videos.</p></div> <p><p>  This is a user-directed feature. You identify users to receive access to your VIZIOgram Content, you invite them via email or text to connect through the VIZIOgram feature, and you send them an invitation to view your VIZIOgram Content. To see the content, the recipient of your message must have both a VIZIO Account and a VIZIO SmartTV.</p></p> <p><p>  VIZIO or authorized VIZIO personnel may access your VIZIOgram Content as needed to perform system maintenance, to investigate or enforce compliance with the VIZIO Account or other applicable VIZIO Terms of Use, to protect its rights and property, and to comply with legal requirements. VIZIO does not access, use, or disclose your VIZIOgram Content for other business purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  Once VIZIOgram Content is uploaded, it will remain available to open for thirty (30) days from the date of the upload. Once opened by you or a recipient, the VIZIOgram Content will remain viewable for another seven (7) days from the date it is first opened. Afterwards, the VIZIOgram Content will be promptly deleted.</p></p> <p><p>  You can also withdraw the ability of other VIZIOgram users to access your VIZIOgram Content by opening your VIZIO Mobile App and blocking those users.</p></p> <p><p>  If you wish to request manual deletion of your VIZIOgram Content, please contact VIZIO at <a href="mailto:privacy@vizio.com" target="_blank"> privacy@vizio.com </a>.</p></p> <div><h1>  VII.
