We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law such as to evaluate the sufficiency of our de-identification processes. We may use and share non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and marketing purposes.

<u> Your Rights under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27). </u> California residents have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Sirius XM does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt in or opt out) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marking purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated in this Privacy Policy, Sirius XM provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you opt-out at the time we offer that choice, we do not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please write to us at: Sirius XM Radio Inc., 1221 Avenue of the Americas, 35th Floor, New York, NY 10104, Attn: Legal Department – Shine the Light Privacy Request.
