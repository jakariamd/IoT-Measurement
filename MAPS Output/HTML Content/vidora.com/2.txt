In the event of any conflict between this </span></div> <span><span>  <u> Section 1.9 </u></span></span> <span><span>   and an effective separate addendum or other agreement governing the use of the Beta Services or Early Access Services signed by Customer and mParticle, such separate addendum or other agreement shall control.</span></span> <div><h4>  <b> 2. </b> <b> Ownership; Reservation of Rights </b></h4><span>    </span><p>  2.1 </p><span>  <u> Customer Data </u></span><span>    Customer shall own all right, title and interest in and to the data derived or collected by the mParticle SDK incorporated into the Supported Customer Properties, integration via a data warehouse connection and/or any data inputted by Customer into the mParticle Platform (</span><span>  <u> Customer Data </u></span><span>  ).  Customer hereby grants to mParticle a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, sublicensable, right and license to copy, distribute, display and create derivative works of and use the Customer Data to perform mParticle’s obligations under this Agreement.  Customer reserves any and all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data, other than the license expressly granted to mParticle under this Agreement.  Except as expressly permitted hereunder or as authorized by Customer in connection with its use of the mParticle Platform, mParticle will not, and will not authorize any third party to: (a) rent, sublicense, transfer, disclose, use, or grant any rights in, or share or provide access to any Customer Data, in any form, collected and created under this Agreement; or (b) collect, use, combine, aggregate, or commingle the Customer Data for the benefit of any third party. </span></div> <p><p>  2.2 </p></p> <span><span>  <u> mParticle Platform Ownership; Reservation Of Rights. </u></span></span> <span><span>    Customer acknowledges and agrees that, as between the Parties, mParticle retains all right, title, and interest in and to the mParticle Platform, all copies or parts thereof (by whomever produced) and all intellectual property rights therein.  Customer shall acquire no rights, title, or interest in or to the mParticle Platform or any copies thereof (by whoever produced), other than the limited licensed rights expressly granted by mParticle under this Agreement.  Customer will not remove, obscure, or alter any intellectual property rights notices relating to the mParticle Platform.</span></span> <p><p>  2.3 </p></p> <div><span>  <u> mParticle Usage Data </u></span><span>    Customer acknowledges that mParticle collects data about its customers’ usage of the mParticle Platform (</span><span>  <u> mParticle Usage Data </u></span><span>  ) and uses it for the sole purpose of generating insights about the use of the mParticle Platform to support and improve the mParticle Platform generally. For avoidance of doubt, mParticle Usage Data will not contain any Customer Data collected by Customer and ingested by the mParticle Platform.  mParticle may use aggregated mParticle Usage Data that does not identify Customer or any of its users for the purpose of describing its products in marketing materials (e.g., total volume of data processed by the mParticle Platform).</span></div> <p><p>  2.4 </p></p> <span><span>  <u> Feedback. </u></span></span> <span><span>    Customer may from time to time provide suggestions, comments for enhancements or functionality or other feedback (</span></span> <div><span>  <u> Feedback </u></span><span>  ) to mParticle with respect to the mParticle Platform.  mParticle may determine whether or not to proceed with the development of the requested enhancements, new features or functionality.  Customer hereby grants mParticle a royalty-free, fully paid up, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to (a) copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, and create derivative works of the Feedback; and (b) use the Feedback and/or any subject matter thereof, including without limitation, the right to develop, manufacture, have manufactured, market, promote, sell, have sold, offer for sale, have offered for sale, import, have imported, rent, provide and/or lease products or services which practice or embody, or are configured for use in practicing, the Feedback and/or any subject matter of the Feedback.</span></div> <div><h4>  <b> 3. </b> <b> FEES; PAYMENT TERMS </b></h4><p>  3.1 </p><span>  <u> Fees </u></span><span>   Customer will pay mParticle all fees and other amounts due to mParticle under or in connection with this Agreement (</span><span>  <u> Fees </u></span><span>  ) at such times as indicated on the Order, as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement or, where no such time period is stipulated in the Order or the Agreement, within thirty (30) days after Customer’s receipt of invoice. Unless otherwise stated in the Order, all Fees are payable in U.S. Dollars. The Fees for access and use of the mParticle Platform are based on annual credits or a base number of MTUs and/or events, in each case set forth in the Order or other applicable pricing terms.  If Customer uses any services not set forth in an Order, Customer will be charged the applicable rates available on mParticle’s website and/or in the applicable special program terms referenced in </span></div> <div><span>  <u> Section 9 </u></span><span>   below.  </span><p>  (a) </p><span>  <u> Credit-Based Pricing </u></span><span>  . If the applicable Order indicates Fees are based on annual credits (to account for a combination of events processed, storage periods and data evaluation), mParticle shall charge Customer Fees based on the pricing set forth therein, subject to payment of additional Fees for Customer’s purchase of additional annual credits and payment of overages, in each case as set forth in such Order.  </span></div> <div><p>  (b) </p><span>  <u> Event/MTU-Based Pricing </u></span><span>  . If the applicable Order indicates Fees are based on a number of MTUs and/or events, mParticle shall calculate and bill overage fees for the mParticle Platform (</span><span>  <u> Overage Fees </u></span><span>  ) monthly in arrears for MTU and/or events usage in excess of this base number of MTUs and/or events (</span><span>  <u> Monthly Overage </u></span><span>  ). The Order may specify a single rate for Overage Fees in which case all Monthly Overages will be charged at that rate. Alternatively, the Order may specify tiered pricing. In such event, if Customer’s usage increases and elevates Customer from a lower tier to a higher tier, the pricing for the higher tier shall become the pricing for the remainder of the Term (unless usage increases afterward to an even higher tier). There will be no reversion to lower tiers. For each month in which Customer moves from a lower tier to a higher tier, mParticle shall invoice the Customer for the difference between the Fees for the new tier and the amount already paid for lower tiers, prorated for the remainder of the Term. As used herein, (i) “MTU” means an mParticle ID that has any activity in a calendar month, and (ii) “mParticle ID” means a single user-profile record created for a specified workspace as governed by Customer’s desired identity strategy.     </span></div> <p><p>  3.2 </p></p> <div><span>  <u> Late Payment </u></span><span>   If payment of any Fees (including any reimbursement of expenses) is </span><span>  not</span><span>   made when due, without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to mParticle, following written notice by mParticle to Customer, interest shall accrue at a rate equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest legal rate permitted by Applicable Law, and Customer will pay all reasonable expenses of collection.  In addition, if any past due payment of Fees has not been received by mParticle within ten (10) days from the time such payment is due, following written notice by mParticle to Customer, mParticle may suspend access to the mParticle Platform until such payment is made in full. </span></div> <p><p>  3.3 </p></p> <div><span>  <u> Net of Taxes </u></span><span>    All amounts payable by Customer to mParticle hereunder are exclusive of any sales, use and other taxes or duties, however designated, including without limitation, withholding taxes, royalties, know-how payments, customs, privilege, excise, sales, use, value-added and property taxes (collectively </span><span>  <u> Taxes </u></span><span>  ).  Customer shall be solely responsible for payment of any Taxes, except for those taxes based on the income of mParticle.  Customer will not withhold any Taxes from any amounts due to mParticle, and all amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement shall be paid in full without any set-off, counterclaims or deductions (“</span></div> <div><span>  Reductions</span><span>  “). If any Reductions are required by Applicable Law, the Customer shall, when making the payment to which the reduction relates, pay to mParticle such additional amount as will ensure that mParticle receives the same total amount that it would have received if no such reduction had been required.</span><p>  3.4 </p><span>  <u> Reimbursable Expenses </u></span><span>   Customer will reimburse mParticle for travel and other related expenses associated with ongoing support, such as Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) and on-site visits, provided that Customer approves such activities via email in advance (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and mParticle complies with any applicable Customer travel and expense policy provided to mParticle from time to time.</span></div> <div><h4>  <b> 4. </b> <b> TERM, TERMINATION </b></h4><p>  4.1 </p><span>  <u> Term </u></span><span>    This Agreement shall be effective from the Effective Date and shall, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, continue until the end of the initial term as set forth on the Order or if an Order has not been signed with mParticle, the initial term shall be thirty (30) days (the </span><span>  <u> Initial Term </u></span><span>  ). Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for additional, successive twelve (12) month terms for those Customers subject to an Order (unless otherwise set forth in the Order) or additional, successive thirty (30) day terms for those Customers not subject to an Order (each, a </span></div> <div><span>  <u> Renewal Term </u></span><span>  ), unless either Party delivers to the other Party written notice at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term of the Party’s intent not to renew this Agreement. If this Agreement is not renewed under this </span><span>  <u> Section 4.1 </u></span><span>  , this Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the expiration of the Initial Term or the applicable Renewal Term (as the case may be). For purposes of this Agreement, “Term” shall mean the Initial Term together with any subsequent Renewal Terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, if Customer is participating in any of the Special Programs referenced in </span></div> <div><span>  Section 9</span><span>   below, the “Term” shall be set forth in applicable terms and conditions for such Special Program.   </span><p>  4.2 </p><span>  <u> Termination; Effect of Termination; Suspension </u></span><span>    In addition to any other remedies it may have, either Party may terminate this Agreement (a) by written notice to the other Party with at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (provided, if there are any Orders in effect, this Agreement will not terminate until all such Orders have expired or have been terminated in accordance with the terms therein); (b) if the other Party breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement in any material respect and such breach is incapable of cure or, where such breach is capable of cure, fails to cure such breach within fifteen (15) days’ notice (or ten (10) days in the case of nonpayment by Customer of Fees) after receiving notice thereof; and (c) unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law, by written notice to the other Party in the event of the other Party’s liquidation, commencement of dissolution proceedings, or any other proceeding relating to a receivership, failure to continue business, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becoming the subject of bankruptcy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, mParticle shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for convenience upon written notice to Customer if Customer is participating in any of the special programs referenced in </span></div> <div><span>  <u> Section 9 </u></span><span>   below. Subject to </span><span>  <u> Section 4.3 </u></span><span>  , upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason (and except as expressly provided for otherwise in this Agreement): (i) mParticle shall promptly delete or erase the Customer Data or the encryption key to the Customer Data; (ii) all rights granted hereunder and all obligations of mParticle to provide the mParticle Platform shall immediately terminate and Customer shall cease use of the mParticle Platform; and (iii) Customer will pay all Fees due and owing up to the date of such termination or expiration (as applicable). Without limiting mParticle’s right to terminate this Agreement, mParticle may also suspend Customer’s access to the mParticle Platform, with or without notice to Customer, upon any actual, threatened or reasonably suspected breach of this Agreement or violation of Applicable Law, or upon any other conduct deemed inappropriate or detrimental to the mParticle Platform by mParticle (including, but not limited to, unauthorized takeover or other malicious activity on Customer’s account).</span></div> <p><p>  4.3 </p></p> <div><span>  <u> Survival </u></span><span>  <u> .  </u> Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all obligations in this Agreement shall terminate, provided that any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after its termination shall remain in full force and effect, including </span><span>  <u> Sections 2.2 </u></span><span>   (mParticle Platform Ownership), </span><span>  <u> 2.3 </u></span><span>   (mParticle Usage Data), </span></div> <span><span>  <u> 2.4 </u></span></span> <span><span>   (Feedback), </span></span> <p><p>   (Fees; Payment Terms), </p></p> <span><span>  <u> 4.2 </u></span></span> <span><span>   (Termination; Effect of Termination),</span></span> <p><p>   (Confidentiality), </p></p> <span><span>  <u> 6.4 </u></span></span> <span><span>   (Disclaimer),</span></span> <p><p>   (Limitations of Liability; Indemnification),</p></p> <p><p>   (Special Programs), </p></p> <div><span>  <u> 11 </u></span><span>  (General), and this </span><span>  <u> 4.3 </u></span><span>  (Survival). </span></div> <div><h4>  <b> 5. </b> <b> CONFIDENTIALITY  </b></h4><p>  5.1 </p><span>  <u> Definition of Confidential Information </u></span><span>   As used herein, </span><span>  <u> Confidential Information </u></span><span>   means any non-public information or data, regardless of whether it is in tangible form, disclosed by either Party (the </span><span>  <u> Disclosing Party </u></span><span>  ) to the other Party (the </span><span>  <u> Receiving Party </u></span><span>  ) that the Disclosing Party has either marked as confidential or proprietary, the Disclosing Party has identified in writing as confidential or proprietary within thirty (30) days of disclosure to the Receiving Party, or that a prudent business person in Receiving Party’s position would conclude is confidential given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure; provided, however, that a Disclosing Party’s business plans, strategies, technology, research and development, current and prospective customers, billing records, and products or services shall be deemed Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party even if not so marked or identified.

Customer shall ensure its instructions are lawful and that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with such instructions will not violate Data Protection Laws.</span></div> <p><p>  3.3 Customer Responsibilities</p></p> <span><span>  . Where applicable, Customer shall be responsible for any communications, notifications, assistance and/or authorizations that mParticle may be required to provide to or receive from a third party controller.  Customer is responsible for determining whether the mParticle Platform is appropriate for the storage and processing of Personal Data under Data Protection Laws. Customer further agrees that: (a) it will comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws regarding its use of the mParticle Platform and the processing of Personal Data; (b) it has provided notice and obtained all consents, permissions and rights necessary for mParticle and its Sub-processors to lawfully process Personal Data for the purposes contemplated by the Agreement (including this Rider); and (c) it will notify mParticle if it is unable to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws or its processing instructions will cause mParticle or its Sub-processors to be in breach of Data Protection Laws.</span></span> <p><p>  4. Sub-processors</p></p> <p><p>  4.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that mParticle may engage Sub-processors in order to provide the mParticle Platform. Customer specifically authorizes the engagement of those Sub-processors listed at </p></p> <span><span>  https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/approved-subcontractors/</span></span> <span><span>   (for the mParticle Service),       </span></span> <span><span>  https://support.indicative.com/hc/en-us/articles/4856240377357-Indicative-Subprocessors</span></span> <span><span>   (for the Indicative Service), and </span></span> <span><span>  https://www.vidora.com/docs/approved-sub-processors/</span></span> <span><span>   (for the Cortex Service) or such other successor URL(s) notified to Customer from time to time (together, the </span></span> <div><span>  <u> Sub-processor Lists </u></span><span>  ). mParticle will restrict Sub-processors’ access to Personal Data to what is necessary to assist mParticle in providing or maintaining the mParticle Platform and will remain responsible for any acts or omissions of Sub-processors to the extent they cause mParticle to breach its obligations under this Rider.   </span><p>  5. Security</p><p>  5.1 Security Measures</p><span>  . mParticle shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Personal Data from Security Incidents and preserve the security and confidentiality of Personal Data, in accordance with the measures described in </span></div> <div><span>  Annex II</span><span>   (“</span><span>  Security Measures</span><span>  <u> “) </u>. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that mParticle may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time, provided that such updates and modifications do not degrade or diminish the overall security of the mParticle Platform.</span><p>  5.2 Access and Confidentiality</p><span>  . mParticle restricts its personnel from processing Personal Data without authorization and shall ensure that any person who is authorized by mParticle to process Personal Data is under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty).   </span></div> <p><p>  5.3 Customer Responsibilities</p></p> <span><span>  . Notwithstanding the above, Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by mParticle relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the mParticle Platform meets Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws. Customer further agrees that Customer is responsible for its secure use of the mParticle Platform, including securing its account authentication credentials and taking any appropriate steps to backup any Personal Data processed in connection with the mParticle Platform.  </span></span> <p><p>  5.4 Security Incidents</p></p> <span><span>  . Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, mParticle shall notify Customer without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours. mParticle shall provide Customer with timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or is reasonably requested by Customer to fulfill its obligations under Data Protection Laws. mParticle will also take reasonable steps to contain, investigate, and mitigate any Security Incident.</span></span> <p><p>  6. Audits</p></p> <p><p>  6.1 mParticle shall provide written responses (which may include audit report summaries/extracts) to all reasonable requests made by Customer for information relating to mParticle’s processing of Personal Data, including responses to information and security audit questionnaires submitted to it by Customer and that are necessary to confirm mParticle’s compliance with this Rider, provided that Customer will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year or when Customer is expressly requested or required to provide this information to a supervisory authority, or mParticle has experienced a Security Incident, or on another reasonably similar basis. Nothing herein shall be construed to require mParticle to provide: (a) trade secrets or any proprietary information; (b) any information that would violate mParticle’s confidentiality obligations, contractual obligations, or Applicable Law; or (c) any information, the disclosure of which could threaten, compromise, or otherwise put at risk the security, confidentiality, or integrity of mParticle’s infrastructure, networks, systems, or data.</p></p> <p><p>  7. International </p></p> <div><span>  Transfers</span><p>  7.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that mParticle and its Affiliates and Sub-processors may transfer and process Personal Data to and in the United States and the other locations in which mParticle, its Affiliates or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations as more particularly described in the Sub-Processor Lists. mParticle shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with Data Protection Laws and this Rider. </p><p>  7.2 If an Order or submission form indicates that Customer Data will be localized in the EU or Australia for the mParticle Service, Customer Data will be stored and processed in the EU or Australia (as applicable) solely in connection with Customer’s use of the mParticle Service; </p></div> <div><span>  provided</span><span>  , </span><span>  however</span><span>  , that if mParticle customer service or technical personnel needs to access Customer Data to perform its obligations to Customer, such personnel may be physically located outside the EU or Australia (as applicable) and therefore technically a small amount of data may be processed outside the EU or Australia, as applicable, and, as such, the Parties hereby enter into Standard Contractual Clauses to account for such transfers. For purpose of clarity, this Section 7.2 will not apply to the Indicative Service or Cortex Service.</span></div> <p><p>  8. Deletion or Return of Personal Data</p></p> <p><p>  8.1 Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, at Customer’s written election, mParticle shall delete or return all Personal Data in its possession or control in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. This requirement shall not apply to the extent mParticle or its Affiliates or Sub-processors are required by Applicable Law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, or to Personal Data archived on back-up systems, which shall be securely isolated and protected from any further processing (to the extent permitted by Applicable Law). The Parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data described in Clause 8.5 and 16 (d) of the SCCs shall be provided by mParticle to Customer only upon Customer’s written request.</p></p> <p><p>  9. Cooperation</p></p> <p><p>  9.1 Data subject requests</p></p> <span><span>  . To the extent that Customer is unable to independently access the relevant Personal Data within the mParticle Platform, mParticle shall, taking into account the nature of the processing, provide reasonable cooperation to assist Customer in responding to any requests from individuals relating to the processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. In the event that any such request is made to mParticle directly, mParticle shall promptly notify Customer and will not respond to the request directly except to direct the data subject to the Customer without Customer’s prior authorization, unless and to the extent legally compelled to do so. </span></span> <p><p>  9.2 Law enforcement requests</p></p> <span><span>  . If a law enforcement agency sends mParticle a demand for Personal Data (including through a subpoena or court order), mParticle will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that Personal Data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, mParticle may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the law enforcement agency. If compelled to disclose Personal Data to a law enforcement agency, then mParticle will give Customer reasonable notice of the demand to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, unless mParticle is legally prohibited from doing so.</span></span> <p><p>  9.3 General cooperation</p></p> <span><span>  . Each Party will reasonably cooperate with the other in any activities contemplated by this Rider and to enable each Party to comply with its respective obligations under Data Protection Laws.</span></span> <p><p>  10.

The Parties further agree that the “Business Purposes” for processing Personal Data under U.S. State Privacy Laws is set forth in the Agreement and this Rider and that mParticle will not retain, use, or disclose Personal Data for any purposes other than the Business Purposes. To the extent required under the U.S. State Privacy Laws, mParticle shall comply with the provisions of </span></span> <div><span>  <u> Section 5 </u></span><span>  of this Rider. mParticle shall notify Customer if it determines that it is no longer able to adhere to U.S. State Privacy Laws and acknowledges Customer’s right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate any unauthorized use of Personal Data by mParticle.</span><p>  10.1.2 California (CCPA). </p><span>  In furtherance of the provisions of</span><span>  <u> Section 10.1.1 </u></span><span>   above, to the extent that Personal Data is subject to the CCPA, mParticle agrees that it shall process Personal Data as a service provider and shall not (a) retain, use or disclose Personal Data for any purpose other than the purposes set out in the Agreement and this Rider and as permitted by the CCPA; or (b) “sell” personal information (as defined and interpreted within the requirements of the CCPA). The Parties agree that Customer’s transfer of Personal Data to mParticle is not a sale, and Customer provides no monetary or other valuable consideration to mParticle in exchange for the Personal Data.</span></div> <p><p>  10.2 Europe</p></p> <p><p>  10.2.1 To the extent that Personal Data is subject to European Data Protection Laws, the terms in this </p></p> <span><span>  <u> Section 10.2 </u></span></span> <span><span>   shall apply in addition to the terms in the remainder of this Rider.</span></span> <p><p>  10.2.2 Processing Instructions</p></p> <span><span>  . Without prejudice to </span></span> <span><span>  <u> Section 3.3 </u></span></span> <span><span>   (Customer Responsibilities), mParticle shall notify Customer in writing, unless prohibited from doing so under Data Protection Laws, if it becomes aware or believes that any processing instructions from Customer violate European Data Protection Laws.</span></span> <p><p>  10.2.3 Sub-processor Obligations</p></p> <span><span>  . mParticle shall enter into a written agreement with each Sub-processor imposing data protection obligations no less protective of Personal Data as required by this Rider (to the extent applicable, considering the nature of the services provided by the Sub-processor).  </span></span> <p><p>  10.2.4 Changes to Sub-processors</p></p> <span><span>  . mParticle will provide at least thirty (30) days’ prior notice via updating the Sub-processor Lists (or such other notification mechanism made available by mParticle) if it intends to make any changes to its Sub-processors. Customer may object in writing to mParticle’s appointment of a new Sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to data protection (e.g., if making Personal Data available to the Sub-processor would violate European Data Protection Laws or weaken the protections for Personal Data) by notifying mParticle in writing to </span></span> <span><span>  legal@mparticle.com</span></span> <span><span>   within ten (10) days of receiving notification from mParticle. In such event, the Parties shall discuss Customer’s concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a mutually acceptable resolution.
