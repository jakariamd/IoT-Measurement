<div><h1>  <strong> Spotify Cookie Policy </strong></h1><p>  Effective as of 29 May 2023</p><p>  This policy describes how Spotify uses cookies. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'. The purpose of this Policy is to provide you, a user of Spotify's services and/or websites (we'll collectively call these the 'Services'), with clear information about the purposes for which Spotify uses cookies and the choices you have when it comes to managing your cookie settings.</p></div> <div><h2>  <strong> 1. What are cookies? </strong></h2><p>  Cookies are small pieces of text which are downloaded to your device, for example, when you visit a website. Cookies are useful because they allow Spotify and our partners to uniquely recognise your device and support the continuity of your experience, for example by helping us to understand your preferences or past actions.

How do we use cookies? </strong></h2><p>  Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p><p>  Spotify uses two main categories of cookie: (1) strictly necessary cookies; and (2) optional cookies:</p><p>  These cookies are set by Spotify or a third party on our behalf, and are essential to enable you to use the features of our Services, such as technically delivering content, setting your privacy preferences, logging in, making payments or filling in forms. Without these cookies, our Services cannot be provided so you cannot decline them.</p></div> <p><p>  Optional cookies may be 'first party cookies' or 'third party cookies'. First party cookies set directly by Spotify or by a third party at our request. Third party cookies are set directly by a third party or set by Spotify at the request of a third party, such as our analytics or advertising service providers. You can see a list of these partners at this <u> link </u>.
