In addition, termination of the Agreement will not affect the rights of any listeners who downloaded Your Content prior to termination.</p></p> <p><p>  Following cancellation, termination or expiration of this Agreement, we may make Your Content available to You for export or download for no more than thirty (30) days. After such 30-day period, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any of Your Content. It is your responsibility to redirect Your Content to different feeds; provided, however, that Spotify will not help redirect Your Content to different feeds upon any such cancellation, termination or expiration of the Agreement (or sooner if agreed by Spotify, as applicable) unless and until all outstanding invoices/payments have been paid to Spotify under this Agreement.</p></p> <p><p>  Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, payment of the fees set forth in the Order Form, Spotify grants You limited, personal, non-exclusive, revocable and non-transferable permission to use the features and functionality of the Megaphone Platform during the Term, solely for your internal business purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.1 APIs. </strong> Spotify may, in its sole discretion, make certain application programming interfaces (APIs), API access tokens, HTML scripts, prefixes, data import tools, or other software available to You as part of the Megaphone Platform (collectively, "<strong> Megaphone APIs </strong>"). In such event, Spotify grants You non-exclusive, revocable and non-transferable permission, during the Term, to use the Megaphone APIs solely to access and use the Megaphone Platform in accordance with this Agreement.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.2 Prohibited Uses; Restrictions on Your Use of Data. </strong> You will not: (a) sell, rent, sublicense or lease any part of the Megaphone Platform to any third party; (b) take any actions to artificially alter the download or streaming numbers of the Podcasts as measured by the Megaphone Platform; (c) interfere with the Megaphone Platform or disrupt any other user's access to the Megaphone Platform; (d) reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works based on the Megaphone Platform, the Spotify IP, or any part thereof; (e) submit to the Megaphone Platform any content or data that contains mass mailings or any form of "spam"; (f) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Megaphone Platform, including the submission of any Malicious Code to the Megaphone Platform; (g) use any robot, spider, data scraping, extraction tool or similar mechanism with respect to the Megaphone Platform; or (h) access the Services for any competitive purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.3 Spotify Audience Network. </strong> If You opt in to participate in the Spotify Audience Network, You acknowledge and agree that Spotify shall have the right to sell Ads and to place such Ads within Your Content in accordance with the additional terms agreed between You and Spotify.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.4 Payment Terms. </strong> All invoices are payable by Customer to Spotify net thirty (30) days from the invoice date. All Service Fee amounts are in U.S. Dollars. Past due amounts shall bear a late payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is higher. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, all Service Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. Unless otherwise directed by Spotify to pay via credit card, Customer shall send payments to the payment address specified in the Agreement (or a successor address of which Spotify notifies Customer) or, via electronic funds transfer, using the account and routing information provided by Spotify. To the extent Spotify requires payment via credit card for any Service(s), Customer hereby authorizes Spotify to charge such credit card on a recurring, monthly basis for amounts due. Customer agrees to maintain its credit card in an active status, and/or provide updated credit card and billing information to Spotify to allow for the recurring, monthly payments. Customer agrees to pay for all charges for Services if charges made to Customer's credit card are unsuccessful for any reason.</p></p> <p><p>  All applicable fees and any additional payment terms for the Services provided under this Agreement will be as set forth on the corresponding Order Form. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in an Order Form to the contrary, Spotify designated measurements shall always control over any third party reporting statistics for reporting impressions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some advertisers may require Spotify to track and bill impression delivery using third party tags. In the event of any discrepancy between such third party reporting and the internal calculations by Customer, Spotify may rely on such third party tags to calculate the revenue to be paid by advertisers under the Spotify Audience Network program. For the purposes of clarity, in the event that the Spotify Audience Network is obligated to bill advertisers in accordance with third party delivery numbers, the corresponding publishing partner (i.e. Customer) may be paid out based on that metric as well.</p></p> <p><p>  If Spotify detects any invalid activity, including but not limited to any erroneous or artificial impressions or other artificial activity using any bot, script or other automated or manual means ("<strong> Invalid Impressions </strong>"), Spotify has the right to (1) terminate or suspend Customer's account; (2) withhold payment for any such Invalid Impressions, and/or (3) collect amounts previously paid to Customer associated with such Invalid Impressions (the "<strong> Clawback Amounts </strong>") via a deduction from future amounts owed by Spotify to Customer or via collection mechanisms it deems appropriate. Customer will pay any reasonable costs and expenses Spotify incurs in collecting payment of the Clawback Amounts. Spotify may delay payment while investigating invalid activity. If Spotify's investigation ascertains that there is no breach, then Spotify will resume payment. Further, to the extent Spotify does not deem an impression to be either "Filled" or "Received," as applicable, Spotify shall not owe any associated payment to Customer for such impression(s). Spotify reserves the right upon request (email to suffice) to require that Customer provide a credit card for Spotify to retain for the purpose of charging any outstanding fees).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.5 Taxes. </strong> Unless stated otherwise, the amounts that the parties must pay under this Agreement are exclusive of VAT, GST, HST, sales taxes or other similar taxes, duties, charges or assessments ("<strong> Indirect Taxes </strong>"). Spotify reserves the right to collect any Indirect Taxes that may become due in accordance with applicable law in connection with use of the Megaphone Platform. For purposes of providing Spotify an invoice, Customer agrees to allow "self billing" such that Spotify (or its agent) may create an invoice on Customer's behalf. Spotify's payment of an invoice will not later prevent Spotify from disputing the invoiced amounts pursuant to any rights herein. Spotify may recoup any amounts due to Spotify from Customer by withholding such amounts from any Fees otherwise due under this Agreement and providing notice thereof. In the event that Customer's bank or financial institution charges or assesses a fee for the receipt of payments from Spotify (or its authorized payment provider) then, as between Spotify and Customer, such fee shall be Customer's responsibility. Where required by the law of a jurisdiction, each party will provide the other with a valid VAT registration number and if requested, a declaration as to VAT registration status. If any circumstance beyond the control of the parties changes, or the VAT registration number provided by a party is, or becomes, invalid during the period of this Agreement, the parties will cooperate to credit and issue new invoices consistent with any VAT requirements as required by the law of the relevant jurisdiction. Spotify will not pay to Customer any amount on account of any interest or penalties associated with the underpayment of any VAT by Customer.</p></p> <p><p>  Each party will fulfill its obligations relating to Indirect Taxes including any obligation to pay Indirect Tax where payable. The Parties will use their best efforts to ensure the correct Indirect Tax outcomes. Customer will provide all information requested by Spotify from time to time to ensure the proper tax reporting and treatment of payments contemplated herein. Each Party shall be solely responsible for the payment and reporting of all taxes applicable to its own income and activities in each jurisdiction where applicable. Spotify assumes no liability or responsibility for any tax obligations and related compliance and filings arising on the Customer as a result of this Agreement or otherwise.</p></p> <p><p>  Spotify reserves the right to deduct and withhold tax from any payment made under or in connection with this Agreement and shall pay the Customer on the amount due after the deduction or withholding, if required by law based on Spotify's judgment. If deductions or withholdings of tax have been made, Spotify shall pay the withheld tax to the appropriate tax authority and provide copies of receipts for such withholding tax to Customer. Customer is obliged to provide evidence of any tax treaty entitlement that, in Spotify's judgment, satisfies the requirements of the applicable law, as necessary to claim exemption from or reduction of withholding tax. All payments made by Spotify under or in connection with this Agreement will only be remitted to bank accounts within the country of residence of the payee.</p></p> <p><p>  Digital service taxes ("<strong> DST </strong>"), or other similar gross based taxes on advertising services, will be added on top of agreed amounts for all jurisdictions where DSTs are enacted.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5.1 Your Content. </strong> As between You and Spotify, You own and/or control Your Content. Spotify does not claim any ownership rights to nor any responsibility over Your Content. You acknowledge and agree that Your Content remains solely your responsibility.</p></p> <p><p>  In addition to, and without limiting the conditions set forth in Section 4, You must not upload, store, distribute, send, transmit, display, perform, make available, continue to make available or otherwise communicate to the public any of Your Content to which You do not hold the necessary rights. Any unauthorized use of copyright protected material within Your Content (including by way of reproduction, distribution, modification, adaptation, public display, public performance, making available or otherwise communicating to the public via the Megaphone Platform), independent of whether it is or becomes unauthorized, may constitute an infringement of third party rights and is strictly prohibited.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5.2 Spotify IP. </strong> Spotify retains all right, title and interest (including, but not limited to, all intellectual property and proprietary rights therein) in and to: (a) the Services, including the Megaphone Platform and the technology and software used to provide it; the Megaphone APIs; the Spotify Audience Network; and any and all technology used to produce, store and/or distribute, as applicable, the Podcasts and the Ads, as well as any and all related trademarks, logos, service marks (e.g., Megaphone and Spotify) (collectively, "<strong> Marks </strong>"); and (b) all data, information and other content (excluding Your Content) contained in or derived from the Megaphone Platform ((a) and (b) collectively, "<strong> Spotify IP </strong>"). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, Spotify shall have the right to use or disclose the Spotify IP, at its sole discretion. In addition, except for your limited rights to access and use the Megaphone Platform as expressly set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement licenses or conveys any right to the Spotify IP to anyone, including You.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5.3 Feedback. </strong> You acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and You authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to You.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5.4 Privacy. </strong> The parties acknowledge and agree that Spotify receives certain personal data (such as IP addresses) from the listeners when they play Your Content on a streaming service (e.g., Spotify, Apple Podcast, etc.) or other playback client that enable playback of Your Content (e.g., websites that embedded an RSS feed). The data Spotify may provide to Customer with respect to the distribution of Your Content via the Megaphone Platform is considered pseudonymized under GDPR, in such circumstances, this <u> Independent Controller DPA </u> shall apply. To the extent Customer uses the podcast analytics services (including the promotional attribution and audience insight tools) currently known as Chartable, this <u> Processor / Service Provider DPA </u> shall apply. To the extent Customer enables an independent third party measurement partner for the purpose of measuring ads, Customer will ensure that such measurement partner: (a) uses data received from Spotify for the sole purpose of providing measurement and attribution reporting to Customer; and (b) does not, directly or indirectly, sell, share, or process for purposes of targeted advertising, any data received from Spotify. The terms "sell", "share" and "targeted advertising" used in this paragraph shall have the meaning set forth in applicable privacy laws, such as the CCPA.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6.1 Your Content. </strong> By making Your Content available to the Megaphone Platform, and entering into this Agreement, You hereby grant Spotify the worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right (including the right to sublicense) to: (a) use, copy, reproduce, transmit, modify, publicly perform, display publicly, promote, market, distribute, and otherwise make Your Content available to end users and third parties including via download and streaming; and (b) to use Your Content for analytics, platform monitoring, advertiser studies (e.g., brand lift studies), development and improvement.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6.2 Data Use. </strong> Unless otherwise set forth in an Order Form, You acknowledge and agree that Spotify will be entitled to use data contained in or derived from Your Content and your usage of the Service both during and beyond the term of your Agreement for performance of the Services, analytics, platform monitoring, and product improvement, provided that Spotify will not identify You externally in connection with such data usage. Additionally, You acknowledge and agree that Spotify may receive certain personal data (e.g. IP addresses, device IDs, etc.) from listeners when they play Your Content on a streaming service (e.g. Spotify) or other playback client that enables playback of podcast content (e.g. websites that embed an RSS feed) (collectively, "<strong> Listener Data </strong>"). As between the parties, all such Listener Data will be owned by Spotify.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6.3 Third Party Service Providers. </strong> In addition to, and without limiting the generality of the licenses in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, Spotify may also distribute, use and/or provide Your Content and certain associated data (including, but not limited to, IP addresses and user agents): to Spotify's service providers who act on Spotify's behalf in providing the Megaphone Platform and/or the Services (e.g., third party hosting providers, analytics providers, credit card processors, transcription services, etc.), as well as to additional third parties chosen by Spotify that are used to provide various additional other value-added services which may be offered by Spotify from time to time in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement. Third party processing of credit card payment data will be subject to such third party processor's privacy policy. Some Services may also be provided or fulfilled by Spotify's Affiliates.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6.4 Linked Services </strong> You acknowledge that the foregoing licenses in this section will extend to operators and users of any other websites, applications and/or platforms to which Your Content has been shared or embedded by Spotify including, but not limited to, third party platforms and/or services where Podcasts and related content are made available (collectively, "<strong> Linked Services </strong>"). The licenses granted in this section are granted separately with respect to each item of Your Content. Licenses with respect to Your Content, and any images or text within your account, will (subject to Section 3) terminate automatically when You remove such Content from your account.</p></p> <p><p>  Removal of files in Your Content from your account will result in the deletion of the relevant files from Spotify's systems and servers. However, You acknowledge that once Your Content is distributed to a Linked Service, Spotify is not obligated to ensure the deletion of Your Content from any servers or systems operated by the operators of any Linked Service, or to require that any user of Spotify or any Linked Service deletes any item of Your Content. In addition, listeners who have downloaded Your Content prior to termination will be able to keep such copies.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7.1 General. </strong> Each party represents and warrants that it has the necessary authority to enter into this Agreement and grant the rights as set forth herein, and that it will use reasonable care applicable to its performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Additionally, You represent and warrant that: (a) You have obtained and possess all licenses, rights, consents and permissions necessary to make Your Content available to the Megaphone Platform and to grant Spotify the rights and licenses set forth in this Agreement for Spotify's use of Your Content as contemplated in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, all of the music used in Your Content; (b) all rights, licenses, consents, waivers, clearances, or approvals necessary required from any collecting society (including but not limited to collecting societies such as STIM, MCPS, PRS, PPL and VPL) or any other party necessary in order for Spotify to lawfully exercise and enjoy its rights granted under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all necessary music (e.g., with respect to all sound recordings, audio-visual master licenses and consents, etc.), synchronization, mechanical transfer and performing rights clearances) have been or will be obtained and paid for and shall be maintained during the Term by You; (c) neither Spotify nor any Linked Service will need to obtain licenses from any third party or pay royalties to any third party whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any unions, artists, or performing rights societies (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.)) for use of Your Content as contemplated under this Agreement; (d) Your Content does not and will not infringe upon any third party's rights, including any intellectual property rights (including any copyright, trademark, patent, or privacy rights, or any other proprietary rights); (e) You will comply at all times with this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the requirements set forth in the Platform Policies) and all applicable laws and regulations; and (f) any materials made available to the Megaphone Platform including, without limitation, Your Content, does not contain anything that is defamatory, libelous, or that violates any confidentiality obligations You have with a third party.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7.2 Disclaimer. </strong> Spotify reserves the right to modify the Megaphone Platform from time to time during the Term at Spotify's sole discretion. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Megaphone Platform that Spotify provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, including without limitation security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements. In some instances, enhancements, updates, upgrades, and new additions to the Megaphone Platform may involve incremental fees, determined at Spotify's sole discretion, and shall be subject to authorization from You which may be provided by email, click-through agreement and/or continued use of the Megaphone Platform. You acknowledge that You are responsible for backing up Your Content and that Spotify will not have any liability to You for any loss of any of Your Content whatsoever.</p></p> <p><p>  In addition, You acknowledge that, as an internet-delivered software application, the Megaphone Platform may experience periods of downtime, including but not limited to scheduled maintenance, and third-party service outages. Spotify has no obligation to screen or monitor any content and does not guarantee that any content available via the Megaphone Platform complies with this Agreement. You therefore use the Megaphone Platform at your own risk.</p></p> <p><p>  ACCORDINGLY, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SPOTIFY PROVIDES THE MEGAPHONE PLATFORM ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS; AND SPOTIFY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE MEGAPHONE PLATFORM, INCLUDING ITS DOCUMENTATION, THE MEGAPHONE PLATFORM SOFTWARE AND THE MEGAPHONE APIs, OR ANY DATA OR CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MEGAPHONE PLATFORM (EVEN IF LINKED TO FROM THE MEGAPHONE PLATFORM) INCLUDING ANY ADS THAT ARE DELIVERED THROUGH A SERVICE.

In no event will an indemnified party be liable for any settlement that admits any fault of or imposes any monetary liability on an indemnified party without its prior written consent (such consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).</p></p> <p><p>  At any time during the Term, in the event that any of your Podcasts are published to a Linked Service, Customer acknowledges that such Linked Service, which may include the Spotify platform and/or the Anchor platform, may require that You agree to separate license terms, terms of use agreements and/or privacy policies as a condition of any such distribution or use of the Linked Service(s). Spotify will not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for any third party Linked Services.</p></p> <p><p>  As used herein, the "<strong> Confidential Information </strong>" of a party (the "<strong> Disclosing Party </strong>") means all financial, technical, or business information of the Disclosing Party that the Disclosing Party designates as confidential at the time of disclosure to the other party ("<strong> Receiving Party </strong>") or that the Receiving Party reasonably should understand to be confidential based on the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure. By way of example, the Megaphone APIs, pricing for the Megaphone Platform, and information about Spotify's tool and feature upgrade pipeline are all Spotify's Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will be construed to limit Spotify's ability to publicly disclose information about its data and to mention its partners and shows. Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, the Receiving Party will not disclose, duplicate, or otherwise make available any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person or entity without the Disclosing Party's prior written consent.
