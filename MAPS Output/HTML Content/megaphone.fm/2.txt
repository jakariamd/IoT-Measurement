Opt-Outs. </b></p></p> <p><p>  <u> Opting out of cookies. </u> If you want to stop or restrict the placement of cookies or flush any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences. Further information on cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.

If you want Nielsen to stop providing us with your information, </p></p> <span><span>  <u> please use Nielsen’s opt-out function </u>. </span></span> <p><p>  Please note that Nielsen’s opt-out function does not opt you out of tailored advertising entirely - it works independently and is unique to each browser on your devices and each IP address that you use to access podcasts. For instance, if you opt out of tailored advertising on your iPad at home but not on your iPhone at home, you may still receive tailored advertising while listening to podcasts on your iPhone. Relatedly, if you opt out on your iPad at home but then listen to podcasts from a different location, you may still receive tailored ads. </p></p> <p><p>  Once you opt out, Nielsen will stop providing us with your data. It can take up to 30 days for our database to update your selection, during which you may still receive tailored advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Promotional Communications </u>. If you are a Publisher or Advertiser who has opted into receiving newsletters from us (which may include updates about new or improved products and features), you may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those messages or by contacting us at any time. If you opt out from promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 8. Data Security </b></p></p> <p><p>  We are committed to protecting the personal data in our systems. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are a Publisher or Advertiser and have an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of your account using your password, whether or not authorized by you.  Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 9.

International Transfers  </b></p></p> <p><p>  Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify shares personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. They may process your data in countries whose data protection laws are not considered to be as strong as EU laws or the laws which apply where you live. For example, they may not give you the same rights over your data. </p></p> <p><p>  Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to:</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law</li><li>help to give your data the same level of protection as it has in the EU and the laws which apply where you live</li></ul><p>  <b> 11. Changes to this Policy </b></p><p>  We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in case of material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.  </p></div> <p><p>  <b> 12.
