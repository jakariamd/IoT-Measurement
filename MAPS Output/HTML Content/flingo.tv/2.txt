Any collection and processing of information that you have provided about another person will be in accordance with this Policy.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> 1.2 Information We Get When You Use Our Services </strong></h3><p>  We may collect information about the Services you or your household use and how they are used, such as when you watch a video on a Samba mobile application, visit a third-party website or app that uses our Integrated Services, or interact with our ads and content. </p></div> <div><h3>  a. What Information We Receive</h3><ul>  <li><strong> Content Viewing Information: </strong> We receive information about the content you view and interact with when you enable our Services in your Smart TV (“Content Viewing Information”). We may also receive Content Viewing Information if you enable a Smart TV App that integrates our Services. Content Viewing Information includes things like the title of the content, actions taken while viewing the content, and the length of time you viewed it.</li><li><strong> Log Information: </strong> We automatically collect standard log files when you use our Services, which include the time and date of access, pages or features viewed, IP address, the type of web browser you use, and the referral URL.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Device Information: </strong> We collect information about the devices you use to interact with our Services. This device-specific information may include the hardware model and brand, operating system, device identifiers, resource usage, and error logs. We may also discover when your Smart TV is available to connect with a mobile device, which can, for example, be used to make pairing your devices easier.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  b. How We Receive This information</h3><ul>  <li><strong> Smart TV Services:  </strong>When you opt-in to our Smart TV Services, we may recognize the content played through your TV. Please note, we are only able to recognize public content, such as certain shows and movies. We won’t know when you’re watching, for example, home videos.</li><li><strong> Smart TV Apps </strong>: We may receive such viewing information when you use our Smart TV Apps or third-party Smart TV apps that use our Integrated Services.</li><li><strong> Mobile Applications </strong>: We may receive information about your mobile device and the applications you are running on it. The information we receive may include, for instance, the mobile device’s advertising identifier (e.g. the IDFA or Google Android Ad ID).</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cookies and Other Technologies:  </strong>We use various technologies to collect information when you interact with our Services. These technologies include cookies, local storage and web beacons. Cookies and local storage are small data files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. Cookies and local storage enable us and our customers to provide features and functionality (such as keeping you logged in), measure the popularity of our Services, and monitor their performance. Web beacons (or pixel tags) are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails to help deliver cookies, count website visits, and determine the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns. Our cookies are generally set to expire thirteen (13) months from the last time our systems encounter a particular computer or device.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Information from Integrated Services:  </strong>We collect information when you visit or use third-party websites and apps that use our Integrated Services, including through cookies and other technologies described above. For example, when you elect to pair a broadcaster’s app to your TV, that broadcaster can use our technology to synchronize your experience on their mobile apps as you watch a show on your TV. Also, third-party apps and websites can use our measurement and advertising services to better understand usage of their services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertisements. The information we collect includes information about your use of those websites and apps, as well as information those apps or websites enable us to collect from their services. For example, a streaming video provider may enable us to receive information about the content you watch so that our recommendation service can suggest additional content that you might like.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  <strong> 1.3 Information We Collect from Other Sources </strong></h3><p>  Where the law permits, we may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, we might obtain information from data providers and advertising exchange services, including assumed demographics and interests, and data about your engagement with certain ads. We may also obtain from our data providers household or unique device identifiers (such as IP Addresses and Advertising IDs) gathered across platforms (including websites, TV applications, or mobile applications) which may be combined with our data and distributed to our clients so they can better tailor their advertising, marketing, measurement, analytics, and research; our data providers who are contractually bound to comply with all applicable data privacy laws before collecting such data and providing it to us.</p></div> <p><p>  Also, if you create or log into your Samba TV account through a social media service, we will have access to certain information from that service based on the settings and authorizations you grant us through that service.</p></p> <div><h2>  2. Use of Information</h2><p>  We may use the information we collect to:</p><ul>  <li>Provide, maintain and improve our Services (for instance, we use information we collect to refine the user experience, fix service malfunctions, test our security systems and increase our technical performance);</li><li>Monitor and analyze usage of our Services;</li><li>Personalize our Services and deliver recommendations, advertisements, content and features that match your interests;</li><li>Improve our advertising and measurement systems so we can show you relevant ads on and off our Services (for example, if you are interested in cooking shows, we may serve you ads for new TV cooking programs);</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers and events offered by Samba TV or others, and provide content we think you will find interesting;</li><li>Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service; and,</li><li>Detect, investigate and prevent fraudulent and other illegal activities, and protect the rights, safety and property of Samba TV and others.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  To clarify, information we receive about you or your household from using one device or Smart TV may be combined with information we receive from use of other devices or Smart TVs. </p></p> <div><p>  ‍‍</p></div> <div><h2>  3. Sharing of Information</h2><p>  We may share the information we collect about you with third parties in the following circumstances:</p><ul>  <li><strong> With Your Consent Or At Your Direction </strong>: At your direction or if we have your consent to do so, we will share information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Samba TV.

We do so in order to administer and deliver our Services as described in this Policy.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Pursuant To A Change Of Control:  </strong>We may also share information in connection with any merger, sale of assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li><li><strong> When You Are Not Directly Identified: </strong> We may share certain information, such as Content Viewing Information, that does not, on its own, directly identify you as an individual. We may share this information with our partners and customers (including for advertising and analytics purposes), and the public. We may, for instance, publish aggregated reports regarding how many people viewed a particular TV show. Or, we may share data about your device with advertising platforms to help make the ads you see more relevant to you.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> With Advertising Partners: </strong> We engage other companies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and provide analytics services to us. These companies may use cookies, web beacons, device IDs and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and apps, including: your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Samba TV and others in various ways, including to determine the popularity of certain features, deliver interest-based advertising and other content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and to understand the impact of certain advertising and content.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  To clarify, the personal information that we share will not directly identify you, but may indirectly identify you through, for example, your device or other means. The types of personal information we may share include device IDs, advertising IDs, IP addresses, hashed/encrypted versions of your email address or other identifier, or pseudonymous IDs.</p></p> <div><h2>  4. Retention of Information</h2><p>  We will generally retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. However, we may retain certain information as required by applicable law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no basis to continue processing your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it in accordance with applicable laws (though we may need to retain cached or archived copies for a certain period until deletion is possible).</p></div> <p><p>  We may store Content Viewership and Ad Exposure Information for up to three (3) years from the last time our Services encounter a particular device, unless you ask us to delete that information before then. Our cookies are set to expire in less than 13 months. Identifiers associated with your non-Samba TV devices (such as device IDs, mobile ad ids, IP addresses) are kept for no more than 180 days since our last receipt of such identifier.</p></p> <div><h2>  5. International Transfers</h2><p>  Samba TV is striving to make our services available globally. We are based in the United States and currently have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Poland and Taiwan. In the future Samba TV may also establish additional affiliates and subsidiaries in other countries.</p><p>  To facilitate our operations and to help deliver our Services globally, we may transfer personal information to the U.S. and any other country where our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors, consultants and service providers operate. For example, we may transfer your personal information to Samba’s servers in the U.S.</p></div> <p><p>  The countries where we may transfer your personal information might have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective as the laws of your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information abroad, we will take appropriate safeguards to protect the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and seek to ensure that overseas recipients comply with applicable privacy laws.</p></p> <p><p>  When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland, we ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects by placing obligations on the recipient of the data pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.</p></p> <p><p>  Samba TV is also a participant in the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank"> EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield programs  </a>and is committed to the Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer to Third Parties, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability, as indicated by our EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certifications.

Your Choices</h2><p>  Below are the choices we provide in connection with the practices described in this Policy.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> 8.1 Smart TV Services </strong></h3><p>  We require TV manufacturers to provide you with an opt-in to enable our Smart TV Services that collect Content Viewership Information. This opt-in will usually be presented when you first set up your Smart TV, or after your Smart TV gets a software update that includes our Smart TV Services.</p><p>  You should be able to opt in or out of our Smart TV Services at any time your TV is connected to the Internet. You typically can find a feature to opt-out and opt-in in the “settings” menu of your TV; it may also be in the settings menu of the application that integrates our Services. If you have trouble finding this feature, you should contact the TV manufacturer to determine the exact location. If you opt out of our Smart TV Services, we will no longer collect TV viewing information through this service. However, we still may receive Content Viewership Information, as described above in the “Collection of Information” section, when you watch content through certain Smart TV Apps. You should review the opt-out options provided by such applications. If you cannot find the opt-out settings, please contact us at privacy@samba.tv.</p></div> <p><p>  You may also choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking from the Privacy menu within Smart TV Settings on your Smart TV. If you do so, our advertising platform will opt your Samba TV Advertising ID out of receiving targeted advertising based on Content Viewing Information from Smart TV Services, regardless of what device you are using. Note that whenever you want to unlink the data associated with your Samba TV Advertising ID, you can simply reset it. Please check with the TV manufacturer for the exact location of these features. If you cannot find them or your TV manufacturer has not enabled them, please contact us at privacy@samba.tv with your TV manufacturer and model number and we will attempt to provide you with more detailed instructions on where to locate these features.</p></p> <p><p>  If you intend to sell or otherwise give away your Smart TV, you should perform a “factory reset.” This will 1) reset the Samba TV advertising ID, and 2) allow the new owner of the TV to choose whether they want to opt-in or opt-out. If you sell or give away your Smart TV without performing a “factory reset,” information about the new owner may be incorrectly attributed to you.</p></p> <p><p>  You may also find helpful information about how to opt-out of Smart TV Services and television streaming devices at Network Advertising Initiative’s web page dedicated to “<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/" target="_blank"> Internet Connected TV Choices </a>.”</p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> 8.2 Interest Based/Tailored Advertising </strong></h3><p>  You may learn more about “interest-based” or “tailored” advertising, as well as pertinent self-regulatory frameworks by visiting the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative </a> (“NAI”) or the <a href="http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/" target="_blank"> Digital Advertising Alliance </a> (“DAA”).

Please also review the NAI’s <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/" target="_blank"> mobile opt-out instructions </a> located at mobile-choice. For more information on opting out of targeted advertisements on mobile devices.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Note, you will need to opt out on each browser on each of your devices.</p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> 8.3 Cookies And Local Storage </strong></h3><p>  If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or to clear local storage.
