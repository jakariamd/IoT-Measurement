They improve your browsing experience, enable statistical analysis and advanced functions, simplify logging in and personalization, and are sometimes used for targeted advertising.</p></div> <div><h3>  Pixels</h3><p>  Pixels are small images on a website or in an email enabling for example to measure the effectiveness of advertising. Pixels collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies on your browser.</p></div> <div><h3>  Local Storage</h3><p>  Local storage allows data about your browser or device to be stored locally on your browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.</p></div> <div><h3>  Software Development Kits (SDKs)</h3><p>  SDKs may be installed in our services. SDKs may help us understand how you interact with our website or services and may collect information about the device and network you use to access our applications.</p></div> <div><h2>  Session cookies and persistent cookies</h2><p>  We use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to compile statistical information and analyze how people use our websites. This helps us provide more functionality and makes our site easier and better to use. There are two main types of cookies: “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies.</p><p>  Session cookies last only while you have your web browser open. The session cookies are erased when you close your browser. This type of cookie helps the site to function correctly. For example, to expand and collapse menus, to make the Ericsson font appear properly on your screen, or to save your progress through a form.</p></div> <p><p>  Persistent cookies will persist even after you close your browser. How long they persist depends on how they were first set up - the period can vary from minutes to up to 2 years on Ericsson websites. Persistent cookies are used to store the preferences of your current visit, to be used for future visits (such as remembering your location or language preferences, your areas of interest, or other settings that customize your experience). They also help with statistics, analytics, and advertising.</p></p> <div><h2>  Cookies for statistics and analysis</h2><p>  On Ericsson websites, we use cookies and similar technologies from other companies that we work with, who then provide statistics that we can analyze to make our websites better and provide our visitors with more relevant content.</p><p>  To opt out from analytics tracking provided by Google, you can visit the page <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"> here </a>. </p></div> <div><h2>  Third party cookies for advertising</h2><p>  We do not allow third-party advertisements on our websites, but we do advertise our products and solutions on other sites. Some of the third-party sites on which we advertise may drop cookies and similar technologies on both our websites and third-party websites. They use those cookies to store information about products and services in which you have shown an interest as you browse our website and other websites. The information from those cookies allows the third-party sites to display the most appropriate advertisements for you. In some cases, those cookies may lead to the third-party site showing you our advertisements.</p></div> <div><h2>  Your choice - controlling cookies</h2><p>  You can control how we use cookies by adjusting the settings within our cookie banner. Click the button below if you want to withdraw or review your cookie consent for our websites.</p><p>
