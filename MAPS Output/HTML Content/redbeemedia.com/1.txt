</span><span>  Privacy</span><span>  Close menu</span></div> <div><h1>  Privacy</h1></div> <div><h2>  Why does privacy matter to Ericsson?</h2><p>  Privacy is fundamental for building trust in the networked society. ICT has the potential to transform how we innovate, collaborate and socialize – but only if networks and services keep information secure and protect the privacy rights of all.</p><p>  For example, analyzing and acting on the vast amounts of data generated by today’s communication networks can create lasting benefits for everyone. The most effective way to realize this potential is by combining the freedom to innovate and create positive impacts with strong privacy principles that ensure transparency, integrity and appropriate levels of data anonymization. The result is a win-win situation for all stakeholders.</p></div> <p><p>  The nature of Ericsson’s business gives us an additional responsibility to work effectively with privacy. More than 40 percent of the world’s mobile traffic passes through networks delivered by Ericsson, and we manage networks that together serve over 1 billion subscribers. We also handle personal information for a workforce of 116,281 people in over 180 countries.</p></p> <div><h2>  What is Ericsson doing?</h2><p>  We align our business with all legal requirements for privacy. In addition, we have developed a series of clear Ericsson Privacy Principles that form the basis of a comprehensive global privacy program.</p><p>  This program ensures that privacy is designed into Ericsson’s processes, tools, products and services. It proactively engages with key stakeholders and secures buy-in at every stage of the privacy value chain. The program supports our commitment to ensuring the integrity of all personal information for which we are responsible, and helps our customers to develop trusted relationships with consumers and businesses.</p></div> <p><p>  Crucially, respect for the right to privacy is included in our Code of Business Ethics, which defines the behaviors we expect from all Ericsson employees. Along with professionalism and perseverance, the concept of respect is one of Ericsson’s three core values and therefore forms part of the foundation of our company culture.</p></p> <p><p>  We recognize that securing privacy in a connected world requires a sustained cross-industry effort. New technologies bring new privacy implications, and continuous dialog between industry, governments, regulators and civil society is essential. Ericsson is committed to driving and participating in these multi-stakeholder discussions.</p></p> <div><h3>  What is privacy?</h3><p>  Definitions of privacy can vary between stakeholders or countries. However, broadly speaking, privacy is the right to be left alone or to enjoy freedom from interference or intrusion, including the right to have control over how personal information is collected, used, retained and disposed of.</p></div> <div><h3>  Ericsson privacy principles</h3><ul>  <li>Notice to individuals to identify the purposes for which Personal Information is collected, used, retained and disclosed.</li><li>Choice and consent available to individuals with respect to the collection, use, retention and disclosure of Personal Information.</li><li>Collection of Personal Information for the purposes identified in the Notice.</li><li>Use, retention and disposal of Personal Information as identified in the Notice and for which the individual has provided Consent.</li><li>Review of Personal Information for individuals to access their information and ensure it is correct and accurate.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Disclosure to third parties of Personal Information for purposes identified in the Notice and for which the individual has provided Consent.</li><li>Transferring data to other countries in a legal, secure and auditable manner.</li><li>Security for privacy of Personal Information to help protect against unauthorized access and use.</li><li>Quality of Personal Information to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to ensure Personal Information is correct and accurate.</li><li>Accountability and Privacy by Design to ensure compliance with the privacy framework.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  How to contact Ericsson </h3><p>  It's important to us at Ericsson to hear what users have to say about our services, and our policies.
