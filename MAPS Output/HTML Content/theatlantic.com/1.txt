Please note that we may need to retain limited amounts of personal information after completing your request for legal compliance purposes. Additionally, we may postpone completion of your request when your personal information is necessary to fulfill our obligations to you. For example, if you are an active subscriber we may wait until your subscription expires before fulfilling your request.
</li><li><em> Opt out of “Selling,”Sharing, or Using for Targeted Advertising </em><b>  Y </b>ou have the right to opt out of the “sale” of your personal information, or the sharing/use of it for targeted advertising. Under some of these state laws, the word “sale” means our disclosure of your personal information to a third party in exchange for money or any other thing of value, while others only consider it a “sale” if money was exchanged. For the purposes of this policy, when we say “sale,” “selling,” or “sold,” we mean in the broader sense: the exchange of personal information for money or any other thing of value. However, “selling” does not encompass disclosing your personal information to a third party for other purposes, such as those that enable us to provide our Services. We do not sell your personal information in the conventional sense (i.e.,  for money), but may disclose certain details to our business partners and underwriters.

	Sharing or using your personal information for targeted advertising means our disclosure of your personal information to a third party in order to serve you interest-based advertisements. Likewise, it does not encompass disclosing your personal information to a third party for other purposes.

	To opt out of one or both of these practices, please visit <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/do-not-sell-my-personal-information/" target="_blank"> our data opt-out page </a> or email us as previously in this section. You may also opt out by enabling a legally-recognized, opt-out preference signal (such as the Global Privacy Control) on your device. We recognize the signal on a browser level, so you must turn it on on each browser you use to access our Services. Please note that after opting out you will continue to see non-targeted advertisements on our Services.

	Additionally, when residents of California opt out of “sales,” we also treat your request as one made pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to opt out of  the disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their use for direct marketing.

It reflects these practices over the 12 months prior to the day this policy was last updated. As a reminder, our service providers enable us to deliver our Services to you. For example, we use service providers to process your payments, to manage our email communications with you, and to maintain our Services’ safety and security. Please note that the lists below are likely to be overbroad for any single person. Similarly, not every data point that falls into the categories below is necessarily shared with all of the third parties listed. For more information on the categories used in the following chart and the reasons why we share personal data, please review <a href="#1.%20Information%20Collected" target="_blank"> Section 1 </a> and <a href="#3.%20How%20We%20Share%20Your%20Information" target="_blank"> Section 3 </a> of this policy, respectively.</p></div> <div><td>  <b> Category of Personal Data  </b>

As a part of these surveys we may collect Personal Information, including but not limited to demographic information and information about your experiences with our Services. We use this information to help us gain further insight into and to improve our Services. In some instances, participation in a survey may make you eligible to win prizes, e.g, gift cards, in a sweepstakes. Under California law, this may be considered a financial incentive in exchange for Personal Information. The value of a given prize is reasonably related to the value of the information provided. Surveys may be emailed to our users directly or linked to on our website or social media accounts.  </p></p> <p><p>  Participation in any survey is voluntary. You may opt out of receiving surveys from us by emailing research@theatlantic.com. For more information regarding a sweepstakes linked to a particular survey, please refer to that sweepstakes’ official rules.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Notice Regarding California Residents We Know to Be Under the Age of 16 </u> - California residents we know to be younger than 16 years of age will by default be treated as though they have exercised a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information with respect to information provided directly to us (as opposed to information automatically collected from them through technical means). We do not permit such users to opt-in to the sale or sharing of their Personal Information, unless they provide proof that they are no longer under the age of 16. To do so, please email us at privacy@theatlantic.com.</p></p> <p><p>
