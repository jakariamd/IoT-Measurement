<div><h1>  <b> ATOM TICKETS PRIVACY POLICY </b></h1><p>  <b> Last Updated: December 23, 2019 </b>. No changes were made to this Privacy Policy regarding what information We collect or how We use/share it. We have updated the policy for our California and Nevada residents to address new state laws, and we’ve added more information for all of Our users in terms of accessing and controlling Your information via the <a href="https://www.atomtickets.com/legal/atom-privacy-portal" target="_blank"> Atom Privacy Portal </a>.</p></div> <div><p>  <b> TABLE OF CONTENTS </b></p><p>  <b> 1. INTRODUCTION. </b></p><p>  Welcome to Atom Tickets!</p><p>  Atom Tickets, LLC ("<b> Atom Tickets </b>", "<b> We </b>," "<b> Us </b>", or "<b> Our </b>") has prepared this privacy policy (“<b> Privacy Policy </b>”) to describe Our practices regarding the information We collect from users of Our mobile application ("<b> App </b>") and website located at <a href="https://www.atomtickets.com" target="_blank"> www.atomtickets.com </a> ("<b> Website </b>") (collectively referred to as the “<b> Atom Platform </b>”), and the related online services provided by Atom Tickets through the Atom Platform ("<b> Services </b>").</p></div> <p><p>  While this Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Atom Platform, it contains provisions specific to users who are Canadian residents (“Canadian Users”) in order to comply with Canada’s federal privacy laws, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”). Please see <a href="#Section9" target="_blank"> Section 9 </a> for more information.</p></p> <p><p>  If You, as defined in the <a href="https://www.atomtickets.com/tos" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a>, have any questions, concerns, or complaints about Our Privacy Policy, Our information collection, or Our processing practices, or if You want to report any security violations to us, or would like to access, correct, and/or delete Your Personally Identifiable Information, please contact Us at <b> privacy@atomtickets.com </b>. If You make any requests regarding access to or removal of Your information pursuant to this Privacy Policy, We will take reasonable steps to verify Your identity, such as requiring Your user ID or other personal information associated with Your Account.</p></p> <p><p>  So We are clear about the terminology We are using, when We use the phrase "<b> Personally Identifiable Information </b>" in this Privacy Policy, We mean personally identifiable information as that term is described in US privacy law and PIPEDA, namely, information about an individual that (either by itself or when combined with information from other available sources) allows that individual to be identified, including, Your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, as well as any other information that permits You to be contacted physically or online. When We use the phrase "<b> Anonymous Information </b>" in this Privacy Policy, We mean information that does not allow for the identification of an individual or is not associated with or linked to that person’s Personally Identifiable Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with individuals.</p></p> <p><p>  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand Our policies and practices regarding Your information and how We will collect, use, share, protect or otherwise handle it. If You do not agree with Our policies and practices, please do not download the App, register with Our Services, or otherwise use Our Services, the App, the Website or the Atom Platform. By using Our Services, You agree to this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, as detailed below.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 2. CHILDREN’S USE OF ATOM TICKETS’ SERVICE AND THE ATOM PLATFORM. </b></p></p> <p><p>  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to Us. Our Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use Our Services. If You are 13 years of age or older, but under 18 years of age, You may only use Our Services with the involvement of a parent or guardian. We do not specifically market to individuals We actually know are under 13 years of age, We do not collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information from individuals We actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of Our Services is designed to attract individuals under 13 years of age. If We later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, We will take steps to remove that user's Personally Identifiable Information from Our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Services. If you become aware of any data We may have collected from children under 13 years of age, please contact Us.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 3. TYPES OF INFORMATION ATOM TICKETS COLLECTS ABOUT YOU, AND HOW IT’S COLLECTED. </b></p></p> <p><p>  In general, there are two types of information we collect about you – Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information, as defined above.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION </b></p><p>  When You communicate with Us or otherwise interact with publicly available areas of Our Services and the Atom Platform, including posting comments, ratings, or reviews, We will collect and store any information that is contained in Your communications and/or comments (“<b> Public Postings </b>”). Any information You choose to provide when using the Services should reflect how much You want other Users to know about You. You can choose not to provide Us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Services and the Atom Platform You are able to use.</p></div> <p><p>  As You use the Atom Platform, We may collect location-based information from You through Your mobile or other location-aware device. Certain of Our Services are location-specific and can provide helpful information based on where You are. If You consent to telling Us where You are (i.e., by allowing Your mobile device to send Us Your location), We may use that information to provide You with location-based information. If You want to deactivate this feature, You can disable location services on Your mobile device, but We will not be able to provide those Services. Please contact Your carrier for more information.</p></p> <p><p>  When we collect Your Personally Identifiable Information, We may automatically associate that information and information that We collect with Your account so that We can identify You across multiple devices, browsers, and networks. We may also obtain information about You from a third-party data aggregator, cookie technology operator, advertising network, or other form of data company.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Note: </b> Please remember that others may have access to your device. To protect your privacy, you should always log out from the Atom Platform after using any shared devices.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Limits on Collection of Personally Identifiable Information: </b> We will not collect Personally Identifiable Information indiscriminately, but will limit Our collection of Personally Identifiable Information to that which is reasonable and necessary to perform the Services. We will also collect Personally Identifiable Information as authorized by law.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM YOU ABOUT OTHERS </em></p><p>  If You use Our Services to purchase Tickets for others, share Your plans with others, or invite others to use Our Services, You can choose to provide Us with the names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and contact profile photographs of those individuals. <b> By doing so, You represent and warrant that any contact information You provide is accurate and current and that you have obtained any consents from your contacts that are necessary for Us to access and upload the information You provide and to send Your contacts any information and messages that You choose to initiate through Our Services, including via e-mail and text message or short message service messages (“SMS”) number. </b> You or the third party may contact Us at <a href="mailto: privacy@atomtickets.com" target="_blank"> privacy@atomtickets.com </a> to request the removal of this information from Our database. Unless we have independently obtained the Personally Identifiable Information of an individual identified in Your contacts (for example, if such person has independently used Our Services), Our use of such information from Your contacts, with Your consent and representation that You have obtained any necessary consent from Your contacts, shall be limited to facilitating Your use of the Services.</p></div> <div><p>  <em> INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES AND OTHER THIRD-PARTIES </em></p><p>  We may create interfaces that allow You to connect with a social networking service ("<b> SNS </b>"), such as Facebook, through Our Services, or other third-parties. We work with the SNS’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows You to authorize Us to access Your account on that SNS on Your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, You do not provide Us with Your user name or password to the SNS, but You will need to log-in to that SNS directly through Our Services. Once authorized by You, the SNS provides Us a token that allows the SNS to recognize Us when We ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or to post information. For example, when You click "Connect" to grant Us access to Your Facebook account, We will import Your name and other information from Facebook and, as You use Our Services, We may periodically check for updates to such information. You can revoke Our access to any SNS at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within Your account settings on the applicable SNS. Similarly, if You interact with Us through a social media function (such as, for example, “liking” a Facebook post or a tweet), You may be permitting us to have access to certain of Your information from Your SNS profile pursuant to the terms of that SNS.</p></div> <p><p>  <em> INFORMATION COLLECTED BY OUR SERVERS </em>. To make Our Services more useful to You, Our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect certain anonymous information from You, including Your browser type, operating system, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for Your visit.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> FINANCIAL DATA </em>. Any collected financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g. valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date), is stored by the applicable payment processor or digital wallet entity, such as PayPal, Amazon Payments, Braintree Payments, etc. You are encouraged to review their policies and contact them directly for responses to your questions. Feel free to contact us if you have questions about who the applicable payment processor or digital wallet entity is.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> LOG FILES </em>. As is true of most apps and websites, We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes browser type, Internet service provider ("<b> ISP </b>"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track users’ use of the Services, to gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole, and to better tailor Our Services to Our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when You visit the Services again, it will recognize You and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information tailored to Your interests.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> COOKIES </em>. Like many online services, We use cookies to collect information. The cookies ("<b> Cookies </b>") are small pieces of information that a website sends to Your computer’s or device’s hard drive while You are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once You close the web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on Your computer or mobile device until You delete them) to provide You with a more personal and interactive experience on Our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services (and those of third parties) more useful to You and to tailor Your experience with Us to address Your special interests and needs. If You decide at any time that You no longer wish to accept Cookies from Our Services for any of the purposes described above, then You can instruct Your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt You before accepting a Cookie from the websites or apps You visit. Consult Your browser’s technical information. If You do not accept Cookies, however, You may not be able to use all of the Services or access certain features of the Services. If You have any questions about how to disable or modify Cookies, please let Us know by contacting Us at <a href="mailto: privacy@atomtickets.com" target="_blank"> privacy@atomtickets.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> MOBILE DEVICE </em>. We may collect information about the computer or device You use to access Our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, advertising device identifier, and mobile network information. In addition, the Services may access Your device’s image storage applications and contacts, with Your consent, to facilitate Your use of certain features of the Services. Unless we have independently obtained the Personally Identifiable Information of an individual identified in Your contacts (for example, if such person has independently used Our Services), Our use of such information from Your contacts, with Your consent, shall be limited to facility Your use of the Services. For more information about how You can control Our access to these applications, please see "Your Choices" below.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> PIXEL TAGS </em>. In addition, We may use pixel tags ("<b> Pixel Tags </b>") (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of online users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in apps and web pages. Pixel Tags also allow Us to send e-mail messages and in-app advertisements in a format users can read, and they tell Us whether e-mails have been opened and in-app advertisements viewed to help ensure that We are sending only messages that are of interest to Our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We may allow third-party advertisers or partners to use Pixel Tags on the App for the same reasons and in the same methods identified above. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to Our users’ Personally Identifiable Information, nor do We provide enough information to third parties for them to do so.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY ADVERTISERS </em>. We may use third parties to serve ads on the Services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about Your visits to the App and other apps and websites, Your ISP, Your advertising device identifier, and/or the browser You use to visit Our Services. They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to Your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of Our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and We are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and We encourage You to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies, Pixel Tags, and other technologies. If You would like more information about this practice and to know Your choices about not having this information used by these companies, U.S. users can click here: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">  www.aboutads.info/choices </a> and Canadian users can click here: <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca" target="_blank"> www.youradchoices.ca </a>. Via that link You may, among other things, opt out of certain network advertising programs but, if You do, please note that You will still see advertisements, however they may be less relevant to You. Please note that even if You opt out of targeted advertising via that link, We may still track Your visits to the Atom Platform for Our own analytics, operations, and security uses.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> California residents (and others) can also check out our  </b><a href="#Section11" target="_blank"> Notice to California Residents </a><b>  for additional information about what information we collect and how it’s collected as framed by the CCPA (as defined in that section). </b></p></p> <p><p>  <b> 4.

We may also share this information with Our Affiliates, as defined below.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> THIRD PARTIES DESIGNATED BY YOU </em>. When You use the Services, the Personally Identifiable Information You provide will be shared with the third parties that You authorize to receive such information. This includes third party services You link to Your Account. To the extent You post Personally Identifiable Information in comments in a publicly available area while using Our Services (e.g., ratings and reviews), it will be available to other users of the Services who may use it at their discretion. Please be thoughtful about the information or comments that You post.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS </em>. We may share Your Personally Identifiable Information with Our third-party service providers that help Us provide Our Services to You including, by way of example, Our payment processors, vendors who provide technology services, and vendors who provide research and analytics (“<b> Service Provider </b>”). Service Providers will have access to Your Personally Identifiable Information needed to perform their business functions but may not use or share that Personally Identifiable Information for purposes outside the scope of their functions related to the Services.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> AFFILIATES </em>. We may also share some or all of Your Personally Identifiable Information with Our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control ("<b> Affiliates </b>") and require Our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS </em>.

In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personally Identifiable Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires Our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personally Identifiable Information collected by Us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES </em>. Some of Our Services may enable You to post content to an SNS (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), as described above. If You choose to do this, We will provide information to such SNS in accordance with Your elections. You acknowledge and agree that You are solely responsible for Your use of those websites and that it is Your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third-party provider of such SNS. We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such SNS; (ii) the content, products, or services of such SNS; or (iii) Your use of any such SNS. There may be portions of the Atom Platform that provide such SNS functionality.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> OTHER DISCLOSURES </em>. Regardless of any choices You make regarding Your Personally Identifiable Information (as described below), We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information if We believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary: (i) in connection with any legal investigation; (ii) to comply with relevant laws or government requests or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (iii) to protect or defend Our rights or property or other users of the Services; or (iv) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Our Terms of Use, including as part of credit fraud protection.

Thereafter, Your information will be anonymized by removing Your Personally Identifiable Information. Your Personally Identifiable Information will then be deleted and the Anonymized Information will be included in our statistical database.</p></p> <p><p>  We also share Anonymous Information with advertisers, studio partners, and their related agencies. For example, we may use or provide Anonymous Information to create consumer profiles and audience segments for targeted advertising. Because We share only Anonymous Information with advertisers, studio partners, and their related agencies, they are unable to identify You through this information. When You interact with or click on an advertisement, however, You may give the advertiser certain of Your Personally Identifiable Information.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also share Anonymous Information with third party tracking services ("<b> Tracking Services </b>") to help Us analyze how users use the Services. These Tracking Services collect only the advertising device identifier assigned to Your mobile device, rather than Your name or other personally identifiable information, and use it to collect information such as how often users open the App and what features they use in the App. We only use this information to improve Our Services and to better tailor Our offerings and Services (and those of third parties, such as movie studios) to You. We do not combine the information generated thereby with Your Personally Identifiable Information. The collection of this information does not enable these Tracking Services to personally identify or contact You.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also share Anonymous Information with third party service providers ("<b> Analytics Companies </b>") to help analyze how users use Our Services. These Analytics Companies may also use Cookies and/or Pixel Tags to collect information such as how often users visit Our Services and how they use Our Services. We do not combine the information gathered by Analytics Companies with Your Personally Identifiable Information, and the collection of this information does not enable these Analytics Companies to identify or contact You.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> California residents (and others) can also check out our  </b><a href="#Section11" target="_blank"> Notice to California Residents </a><b>  for additional information about what information we collect and how it’s collected as framed by the CCPA (as defined in that section). </b></p></p> <p><p>  <b> 5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION.  </b></p></p> <p><p>  We take the security and privacy of Your information very seriously. We use reasonable security arrangements to protect the Personally Identifiable Information in Our custody or control against unauthorized access, collection, use, alteration, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. We will take reasonable steps, through contractual or other reasonable means, to ensure that a comparable level of Personally Identifiable Information protection is implements by Our suppliers, vendors and agents.</p></p> <p><p>  Unfortunately, while We make reasonable efforts to ensure that Your information is secure on Our system, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. As a result, We cannot guarantee the security of any Personally Identifiable Information You transmit to Us, and You do so at Your own risk. Your use of Our Services and the Atom Platform demonstrates Your assumption of this risk.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 6. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION.  </b></p></p> <p><p>  <em> E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS </em>.

In addition, Public Postings will not be deleted from Our Services, nor will any information We are legally obligated to retain.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> CLOSING AN ACCOUNT </em>. Upon Your request, We will close Your Account. Please note We will delete Your Personally Identifiable Information except as necessary to comply with laws, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, assist with any investigations, enforce Our <a href="https://www.atomtickets.com/tos" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a>, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> DO NOT TRACK </em>. At this time, We do not currently respond to Do Not Track (DNT) requests. We note that there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret DNT signals and there is not a common definition of “tracking” with regard to DNT requests. We may begin responding to DNT request when a uniform technology standard regarding DNT requests is developed.</p></p> <p><p>  From time-to-time, We may, in Our sole discretion, provide additional options on the App, the Website, or any other portion of the Atom Platform to allow You to further opt-out of discrete portions of the information collection detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 7.

Please review the privacy policy of any new site You visit. Also please note that the Services may also contain links to other websites that are controlled by Us but operate under different privacy policies so you should review those policies carefully as well.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 8. CONSENT TO PROCESSING AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF YOUR COUNTRY. </b></p></p> <p><p>  Our Services and the Atom Platform are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the United States, where permitted by applicable law.

Also, while this Section applies to all of Our to users, there are certain differences for residents of select states so please be sure to read those relevant sections as well:</p></p> <p><p>  When You make a Privacy Request, We will ask you for information that allows Us to reasonably verify Your identity, to confirm that You are the person associated with the personal information, and We will use that information <em> only </em> for this purpose. As part of this, We may request that you submit a signed statement under penalty of perjury that You are the individual You claim to be. We will acknowledge receipt of your request within a reasonable period and will endeavor to respond further within a reasonable period thereafter. Please understand that We will not be able to provide You with or delete any personal information if We are unable to verify Your identity and confirm that the personal information relates to You.</p></p> <p><p>  You can make a Privacy Request opting-out of the sale of personal information or asking to have personal information deleted at any time. You may make all other Privacy Requests up to two times in any 12-month period.</p></p> <p><p>  When You make a Privacy Request to learn about or request a copy of the personal information We have collected, or to learn about any of Your personal information that We have disclosed or shared:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>We will not include any information which creates a substantial, articulable, and unreasonable risk to the security of the personal information, Your account, or the security of Our business systems or networks;</li><li>We may limit some or all of the personal information included in Our response to the personal information collected in the 12 months prior to Your request;</li><li>We will endeavor to provide the information in a format that is readily useable: and</li><li>To protect the security of Your personal information, We will provide it via a secure electronic method to Your e-mail address.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  When You make a request for us to delete Your personal information collected from You, please understand that certain information will not be deleted in certain circumstances. For example We will not delete personal information collected from You that is necessary: (i) for Us to complete a transaction for You or otherwise perform a contract or services for You (if You are maintaining Your account); (ii) to detect, protect against, or prosecute security incidents, fraud or illegal activity; (iii) to debug or otherwise identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality; (iv) to use the personal information only internally in ways reasonably aligned with Your expectations as Our customer (such as maintaining sales records); and (v) to comply with legal obligations. When You make such a request, We may ask You to separately confirm Your request. When You make such a request, We will notify any service providers that We have engaged to also delete non-exempt personal information that We have collected from You.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not sell Your personal information for monetary consideration, but We may transfer Your information to third-parties that provide Us with services such as helping Us identify goods and services You will be interested in, helping with advertising, data analysis and security. If You would like to instruct Us not to sell or otherwise share Your personal information in this way, You can do so via the <a href="https://www.atomtickets.com/legal/atom-privacy-portal" target="_blank"> Atom Privacy Portal </a> (or by calling our customer support team at 844-973-3830).

Once We receive such a request We will wait at least 12 months before asking You to reauthorize such a sharing or sales of personal information collected from You.</p></p> <p><p>  We will not discriminate against You or limit Your ability to use the Atom Platform as a result of You exercising any of these rights via a Privacy Request.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> 10.
