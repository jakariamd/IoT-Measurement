However, we will only be able to honor such requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify and, because the CA Personal Information we collect as a Business is limited to Usage and Device Information we collect when you visit the Site (see <u> Section 2.c </u>), we do not have any reasonable way to verify the identity of a CA Resident making any such requests. Nevertheless, requests can be submitted by emailing us at <a href="mailto:CCPA@cheddar.com" target="_blank"> CCPA@cheddar.com </a> or via the request forms available <u> here </u> (for right to know specific pieces of CA Personal Information collected) and <u> here </u> (for correction or deletion).</p></p> <p><p>  <b> d.

We do not knowingly collect Sensitive Personal Information from CA Residents.

Shine the Light Law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83).  </b>A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.
