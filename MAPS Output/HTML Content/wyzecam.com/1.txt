In this section, we describe the categories of information we collect and the sources of this information.</p></div> <div><h5>  Information You Provide to Us</h5><p>  We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information directly from you when you create an account, fill out a form, submit or post content through any interactive features of our Services, make a purchase, communicate with us via third-party platforms, participate in a contest or promotion, volunteer as a product tester, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.

For more information and to exercise your related choices, see the <a href="#e" target="_blank"> Your Privacy Rights and Choices </a> section below. In connection with specific Devices, you may provide us with additional information, such as the name you choose for your Device, or, when setting up or using the Wyze Watch, Wyze Band or Wyze Scale, your birth year, height, weight, gender, and personal fitness goals. This information may be used, for example, to estimate various weight and other physical body metrics for you to view through our Services. You may also provide still images in connection with creating a Smart Vision Scene in conjunction with your use of certain Wyze cameras. We use the content contained in such images to generate the Smart Vision Scene that you direct us to create.</p></div> <div><h5>  Automatically Collected Information and Information We Generate</h5><p>  When you use our Services, we automatically collect or generate certain information about you as follows:</p><ul>  <li>
<strong> Device Log and Sensor Information: </strong> When your Device is connected to our Services, our Services will collect various Device event data, such as when the Device is used, whether it is turned on or off, and when it is capturing video, motion or other sensor data. We provide additional details below regarding information collected by some of our Devices, which we collect in accordance with your Device settings:
</li><li>
<strong> Cameras: </strong> Our Services will collect video and images from your cameras in accordance with your camera storage settings, which may include images or videos of individuals.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Watch, Band and Scale: </strong> The Wyze Watch and Wyze Band have sensors that collect heart rate, speed and other distance and movement data, and the Wyze Scale sensors collect heart rate and weight measurements.
</li><li>
<strong> Person Detection Information: </strong> If you have enabled the person detection feature for your camera, then the Services analyze the video to help detect the presence of a person in that video (without trying to identify that person). We use this person detection information solely to provide and improve this feature. For most users, this person detection information is stored for a limited period of time in accordance with your video storage settings. However, if you choose to voluntarily submit a video to help improve our Services, we store this person detection information for as long as needed to provide and improve the Services but in no event longer than 3 years after the date you submitted the video.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>

These entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, device identifiers, and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and mobile apps, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in mobile apps, links clicked, and conversion information. This information is used to deliver advertising targeted to your interests on our Services and other companies’ sites or mobile apps and to analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your activity. Some of our advertising partners enable us to translate your email address or phone number into an identifier that can’t be used to identify you personally. Our advertising partners then use that unique identifier to show ads that are more relevant to you across the web and in mobile apps. Some of the activities described in this section may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” under certain laws. To learn more about the choices available to you with respect to these practices, see the <a href="#e" target="_blank"> Your Privacy Rights and Choices </a> section below).</p></div> <p><p>  You can also learn more about interest-based ads, or opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance, by visiting <a href="www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank"> www.aboutads.info/choices </a> or, in Canada, <a href="www.youradchoices.ca" target="_blank"> www.youradchoices.ca </a>.</p></p> <div><h4>  DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h4><p>  In certain circumstances, we disclose (or permit others to directly collect) information about you.

We obtain consent to collect that information in those states where consent is required. Moreover, each state’s privacy law may consider different pieces of information to be Sensitive Personal Information.
