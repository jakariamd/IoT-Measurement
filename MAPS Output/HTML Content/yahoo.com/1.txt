<div><h1>  Welcome to the Yahoo Privacy Policy</h1><p>  <em> Last updated: July 2023 </em></p><ul>  <li><strong> About Yahoo </strong>
</li><li>Yahoo, previously known as Verizon Media, is a technology and media company that provides a range of services. We serve our consumers, partners, advertisers and talent through our portfolio of digital platforms, products and services offered under our AOL, Yahoo and other <a href="https://www.yahooinc.com/our-brands" target="_blank"> brands </a>.
</li><li>We provide control tools to help you manage your experience with us. If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy. If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the <a href="https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/index.htm?redirect=no" target="_blank"> legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy </a> or <a href="http://privacy.aol.com/legacy" target="_blank"> legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL) </a> still apply to your account. For Yahoo products or services that are accessed without signing in to an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services as of May 25, 2018. If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today.
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Except as set out elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, when we refer to ‘Yahoo’, it means Yahoo Inc., the US-established company that supplies the Services to you (and acts as data controller of the personal data Yahoo collects when you use those Services).
</li><li><strong> Our Privacy Pledge </strong>
</li><li>Our commitment is to put users first. We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, to keep your information secure and to provide you meaningful choices.

This policy applies to Yahoo <a href="https://www.yahooinc.com/our-brands" target="_blank"> brands </a>, websites, apps, advertising services, products, services or technologies (we’ll collectively refer to these as “Services”). Additional privacy practices for certain Services can be found in <a href="#7" target="_blank">  Details for Specific Products and Services </a>.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Your Controls </strong>

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Additional privacy practices for certain Yahoo Services are included <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/products/index.html" target="_blank"> here </a>.

</li><li><strong> Information Security and Data Retention </strong>
</li><li>Yahoo has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access, use or disclosure of customer information we collect or store. 
</li><li>Yahoo will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the applicable Yahoo Services to you. In some cases, Yahoo has certain business or legal requirements that result in an obligation to retain your personal information for an extended period of time. These obligations may include financial record keeping, ensuring continuity of our products or services, security, fraud, and abuse prevention, or compliance with our legal obligations. In some limited cases, we may keep data for longer than needed for the purposes set out in the <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"> Yahoo Privacy Dashboard </a>, such as: (i) replicating or backing up certain data to “offline” storage for disaster recovery purposes; (ii) truncating, redacting or summarizing raw data, log files and database records into statistical aggregate data or probabilistic data structures to understand long term trends; (iii) maintaining de-identified data for varying periods for research, reporting and product testing or development (in these cases, unique identifiers and linkages to existing data about you are broken or removed so that this data is no longer associated with you, your browser, or device); or (iv) keeping and using certain data to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements (for example, we might keep data associated with an account subject to litigation or a request from law enforcement). For specific information about your personal information or how your personal information is processed by a particular Yahoo product or service you may interact with, please log into the <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"> Yahoo Privacy Dashboard </a>.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Protecting Children’s Privacy </strong>
</li><li>Our Services are for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect, use, or share information that could reasonably be used to identify children under age 13 without prior parental consent or consistent with applicable law. With parental permission, a child under age 13 might have a Yahoo Family Account.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Our Legal Bases for Processing Information. </strong> We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information. First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us. Second, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent. Third, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests. Occasionally, Yahoo may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user’s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation. Please see our <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/legalbases/index.html" target="_blank"> Legal bases </a> page for more information.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Data Processing and Transfers </strong>
</li><li>When you use or interact with any of our Services, you consent to the data processing, sharing, transferring and uses of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. Regardless of the country where you reside, you authorize us to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services. Some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside. 
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Yahoo processes information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK and transfers that information from the EU/EEA/UK through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the European Commission’sA Standard Contractual Clauses. By using our Services, you consent to us transferring information about you to these countries. For more information, please visit our <a href="/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/datatransfer/index.html" target="_blank"> Data Transfer </a> page.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The United States and other non-EU/EEA/UK countries have different laws on data protection and rules in relation to government access to information. If you are based in the EU/EEA/UK, when your data is moved from your home country to a third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.

</li><li><strong> Other Important Information </strong>
</li><li><strong> This Privacy Policy Applies Only to Yahoo.  </strong>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Yahoo does not own or control, or to people that Yahoo does not employ or manage. In addition, some affiliated products may have different privacy policies and practices that are not subject to this Privacy Policy.
