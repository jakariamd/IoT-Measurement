YOUR ARE AN END-USER OF A PUBLISHER’S SITE </h3></div> <div><h4>  2.1.  What Personal Data Do We Process?</h4><p>  <strong> If you are an Internet user and you are visiting a website where one of our network ad is displayed (i.e. a publisher’s site) and/or interact with the ad, we are collecting and processing some personal information about you. </strong> </p><p>  As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms <em> “personal information” </em> and <em> “personal data” </em> mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household.</p></div> <p><p>  The data we collect and process about you does not reflect your name, email address, address, phone numbers, or other data, which could be used to identify you personally. However, the information listed below could be combined with other data to identify or reveal information about you. It may also allow us to recognize your device over time and across websites. Therefore, it may qualify as personal data under applicable laws.</p></p> <p><p>  Please also note that we do not collect and/or process any personal data that could be qualified as sensitive according to the applicable laws (in particular, information concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, trade-union membership, health, sex life or sexual orientation, genetic data or biometric data, criminal convictions or alleged commission of an offense), and we do not allow the Publishers/Advertisers to pass such information to us or target End-Users based on such information. </p></p> <p><p>  We use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixel tags, and unique advertising identifiers) to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices, please check out our <a href="../cookiepolicy" target="_blank"> Cookies Policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  The information we collect and/or process about you includes, without limitation:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Device identifiers and related information </strong>, including your IP address, User Agent (as defined below), your operating system (and version), your Internet Service Provider, and  identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  The term “User Agent” refers to a text (or a string) sent by your browser to every website you connect with, that identifies the type of device you are using (e.g. desktop, mobile or tablet) and the type and version of your browser. Note that your IP address and your User Agent will be combined and anonymized within a short time after the collection, and we will only store the anonymized combination in our records. However, this data might remain in webserver logs that we usually keep 10-14 days for diagnosis purposes.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location data </strong>, as extracted or inferred from your IP address, and including your country, State or region, city, zip code, as the case may be. We also collect your time zone, language, and, if you are in the U.S., the Designated Market Area (“DMA code”).</li><li><strong> Information about ads served, viewed or clicked on </strong>, including the type of advertisement you interacted with, which advertisement you interacted with, the tracking pixel in the advertisement (if any).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Information that an Advertiser has collected about you and shared with us </strong>. When creating an ad campaign, Advertisers can choose to target only a group of End-Users who had a specific behavior that the Advertisers themselves identified (e.g. an End-User who started the sign-up process on the Advertiser’s site, but did not finish it). Note that, in most of the cases, we do not know what is the behavior/criteria used by the Advertisers for their ad campaign. Advertisers are free to use any name or identifier to designate such behavior. We process it as a numeric identifier and do not connect the meaning of the given name anyhow.  This naming option is provided to Advertisers to help them in the organization of their ad campaign, so that they can create some tags for specific behaviors or audience type.</li></ul></ul> <div><h4>  2.2.  Why Do We Use Your Personal Data?</h4><p>  We use your personal data for the following purposes:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Serve ads  </strong>and <strong> allocate the successful advertisement to a particular business transaction </strong> between a Publisher and an Advertiser. </li><li><strong> Geographic targeting: </strong> we give the option to Advertisers to serve ads based on your location, as inferred from your IP address. We do not collect and process your exact position or address.</li><li><strong> Personalized advertising: </strong> we give the option to Advertisers to customize ads showed to you based on your device related information (e.g. an Advertiser can decide to set up an ad campaign targeting internet users using android and a specific internet service provider). Advertisers can also choose to target only a group of End-Users with a certain behavior or a specific audience type that the Advertisers themselves identified (e.g. an End-User who started the sign-up process on the Advertiser’s site, but did not finish it).</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Reporting on ad campaign and ad performance: </strong> reporting to Advertisers and Publishers in the form of aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of online advertising campaigns (e.g. per country, device, or browser type, etc…). </li><li><strong> Fraud detection and prevention: </strong> identifying fraudulent behavior (e.g. invalid clicks/fake traffic) or other unauthorized or illegal activity on the internet. </li><li><strong> Analytics: </strong> analyzing campaigns performance and ad display and conduct research and development in order to improve and optimize our services. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Frequency capping: </strong> preventing you from seeing the same ad or type of ad too frequently.</li><li><strong> Debugging errors in systems </strong></li><li>Respond to requests of competent authorities and/or enforce our legal rights</li></ul></ul> <div><h4>  2.3.  With Whom Do We Share Your Data?</h4><ul>  <li><strong> Entities of our company’s group: </strong> we share your personal information with the following companies of our group based in Luxembourg and Hungary as they are helping us to deliver the ad network related services:
