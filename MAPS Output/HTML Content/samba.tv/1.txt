To do so, go into the Settings menu of your television and access “Samba Interactive TV”.* You can then toggle the services to “off”. If you do not want to disable Samba TV services, but merely want to stop receiving tailored advertising based on your content viewing information, you may disable the “Ad Personalization” feature; or,  enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” feature. Doing so will prevent Samba TV or its advertising partners from using your television viewing choices to tailor advertisements to you. (You will still receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored based on the viewing information collected by Samba TV.) In the Settings menu you may also reset your device identifier, which will unlink the existing data associated with your TV.</p></div> <p><p>  *The names of menus and controls may differ between television brands and models; please read the descriptions in the menus to understand the features on your device. If you cannot find the Samba TV privacy features in your TV settings, please contact us with 1) the make and model of your television, and, 2) the country where the television is located. We will then be able to provide you with a more precise location of these features.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Samba TV Services for Web and Mobile. </em> If you have downloaded Samba TV mobile apps on your mobile device, deleting such apps will prevent collection of or possible sharing of any personal information through the app.</p></p> <p><p>  To limit ad tracking on your iPad, please refer to your iOS settings to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising, or to reset your mobile device advertiser ID to unlink information previously associated with your advertiser ID.
