<strong> Policies </strong>
</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  Product End-of-Life (EOL) Policy</h4><p>  Cisco Meraki may find it necessary to discontinue products for a number of reasons, including product line enhancements, market demands, technology innovation, or the products simply mature over time and are replaced by functionally richer products. We have set our end-of-life (EOL) policy to help customers better manage their product end-of-life transition.</p><p>  When a product reaches EOL, Meraki is committed to communicating important milestones throughout the EOL period.  These notifications will include the initial EOL notification, the End of Sale (EOS) announcement, and the End of Support (EOST) dates, as well as other key information pertaining to Cisco Meraki products.</p></div> <p><p>  Any products being discontinued will be announced as End of Sale and identified on the Cisco Meraki website up to six months prior to the discontinuation and EOS date (also known as the last order date). On the EOS Date, discontinued hardware products are removed from the price list and are no longer available for purchase. The device-specific licenses corresponding to discontinued hardware products will be available for purchase after the EOS Date, unless the license(s) is/are listed in the “End-of-Life Products” list provided below. Cisco Meraki typically provides support for a given product for a period of five (5) years after the EOS date.  If the discontinued product is not available for replacement or repair of an in-warranty return, Cisco Meraki may replace the discontinued product with functionally equivalent hardware and transfer the remaining license term from the replaced product to the replacement hardware.</p></p> <p><p>  Although legacy Cisco Meraki products typically can connect to our cloud-based management software for the entire useful life of the product, following the EOST Date, some things may change, including the following:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Cisco Meraki cannot guarantee that legacy hardware products will be able to connect to the management software indefinitely following the EOST Date;</li><li>Cisco Meraki Technical Support may no longer troubleshoot the legacy hardware products;</li><li>Cisco Meraki may no longer issue firmware updates or patches for the legacy products; and</li><li>New software features available for the management software may not be compatible with the legacy hardware functionality or with the firmware running on the legacy hardware.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If either of the first two situations above occurs, then we will use our best efforts to provide the customer with a workable solution for upgrading from the legacy hardware and, failing that, will credit the value of any remaining license time attributable to the legacy hardware to the customer’s Dashboard organization on a prorated basis.</p></p> <div><h5>  Summary</h5><ul>  <li>End-of-Sale Announcement: Date of official end-of-sales notice, typically six months prior to the last order date.</li><li>End-of-Sale (EOS) Date: The last date to order the product through Cisco Meraki point-of-sale outlets. After this date, the product is no longer for sale via any channel.</li><li>End-of-Support (EOST) Date: The last date a product will be affirmatively supported by Cisco Meraki, typically five years following the EOS Date.</li></ul><p>  <em> *Please note that announcements will be updated periodically to amend the functionally equivalent products. </em></p></div> <p><p>  For a full list of product, announcements and dates, please refer to our <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Other_Topics/Product_End-of-Life_(EOL)_Policies" target="_blank"> Product End-of-Life (EOL) Policies documentations article </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  In some limited cases, Cisco Meraki may also find it necessary to discontinue certain features. For more information, see the <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/lib/pdf/eol/meraki_eol_wan_opt.pdf" target="_blank"> WAN Optimization feature retirement notice </a>.</p></p> <div><h4>  Return Policy and Requesting a RMA</h4><p>  Return policy terms may vary by region. Please refer to the Regional Return Policies section for region-specific terms.</p></div> <div><h5>  Warranty Returns</h5><p>  Cisco Meraki stands behind its products.

This manual review may be conducted by Cisco employees or trusted third-party business partners who are working on Cisco’s behalf.</p></div> <p><p>  In the event that decisions are made solely based on automated methods of processing and produce legal effect or significantly affect an individual, we will provide the impacted individual the opportunity to question the decision or request manual review.</p></p> <div><h5>  Complaint resolution</h5><p>  In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Cisco-U.S. commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information transferred to the United States.

You can read more about the types of cookies we (Cisco and our third-party service providers) use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your cookies choices below.</p></div> <p><p>  Our services may also include “widgets,” which are interactive mini programs that run on our sites to provide specific services from other companies (such as displaying the news, opinions, music, and more). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the widget. Cookies may also be set by the widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by these widgets is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p></p> <div><h5>  What are cookies?</h5><p>  We use the term “cookie” to refer to all technologies which store and access information on the device that you use to access our services, such as your computer, tablet, or mobile phone. For example, we use HTTP cookies (web/browser cookies), which are small data files (typically made up of numbers and letters) that are downloaded when you access our services and allow us to recognize your device. Click here for more information on cookies.</p><p>  Cookies can be necessary and useful in a number of ways. For example, cookies enable websites to recognize your device and are often used to help the website function properly and to provide information to the owner(s) of the site. Cookies are necessary to recognize or “remember” anything about visitors, such as:</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Whether a visitor is logged in</li><li>User-selected preferences</li><li>Items put in a user’s shopping cart</li></ul><p>  There are different types of cookies, including:</p><ul>  <li>Cookies served (i.e., set, shared, provided, offered) directly by Cisco (“first party cookies”) and cookies served on our behalf, for example by advertising and data analytics service providers (“third party cookies”)</li><li>Cookies that only last as long as your browser is open are referred to as “session cookies.” Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser.</li><li>Other cookies are “persistent cookies” and remain after your browser is closed, until cleared. For example, they store your device identifier and recognize your device when you open and use your browser.</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  Which cookies do we use, and why do we use them?</h4><p>  The following table sets out the different types of cookies that our services use, why they are served them, and who serves them.</p><ul>  <li>OneTrust Cookie Consent</li><li>TrustArc Privacy Compliance</li><li>Adform</li><li>Amazon Advertising</li><li>AppNexus</li><li>Baidu</li><li>Bing Ad</li><li>Facebook Conversion</li><li>Facebook Events</li><li>Floodlight Counter</li><li>Google Ads Conversion Tracking</li><li>Google Ads Remarketing</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Google Global Site</li><li>Google Universal Analytics</li><li>Index Exchange</li><li>iPinYou</li><li>LinkedIn</li><li>LinkedIn Insights</li><li>Nielsen DMP</li><li>OpenX</li></ul></div> <div><ul>  <li>Oracle Bluekai</li><li>PubMatic</li><li>Rubicon</li><li>Samsung Ads</li><li>Sizmek</li><li>StackAdapt</li><li>TradeDesk</li><li>Triplelift</li><li>Twitter Analytics Conversion</li><li>Twitter Conversion Tracker</li><li>Yahoo Analytics</li><li>Adobe Visitor ID</li><li>Brightcove</li><li>Cisco Cocoa Chat</li><li>Marketo</li><li>OpinionLab Pixel</li><li>PriceSpider</li><li>Qualtrics</li><li>SalesForce Chat</li><li>6sense</li><li>Adobe Analytics</li><li>Adobe Audience Manager</li><li>Adobe Target</li></ul></div> <div><ul>  <li>Adobe Visitor ID</li><li>AppDynamics</li><li>Bidswitch</li><li>Bing Tracking</li><li>Bizible</li><li>Cision Pixel</li><li>Clicktale/Content Square</li><li>Cloudfront Loader</li><li>comScore Mobile Metrix</li><li>comScore Video Metrix</li><li>DrawBridge</li><li>Google Analytics 4</li><li>Google Tag Manager</li><li>IBM Watson Marketing</li><li>Marketo</li><li>NewsCred Analytics</li><li>Nielsen Visual IQ</li><li>Oracle Eloqua</li><li>SalesForce Email studio</li><li>Sprinklr</li><li>Tealium</li><li>Zift Analytics</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  How can you exercise your cookies choices?</h4><p>  You have the right to choose not to accept certain cookies. However, even optional cookies are an important part of how our services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove certain cookies, this could affect the usability and functionality of our services.</p><p>  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, follow the instructions provided in your browser. Instructions are generally located within the “Help,” “Tools,” or “Edit” menus.</p></div> <p><p>  Some third parties also provide the ability to refuse advertising cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link or you can opt-out proactively.

This is different than blocking or deleting cookies as browsers with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies. There is currently no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may develop in the future. Cisco does not respond to “do not track” signals currently.

Once the order is processed, the customer will receive a confirmation email.  Delays may occur in case of missing information, special shipping requests, and if import/export related verification is required. </p></div> <div><h5>  Order Number</h5><p>  A single Cisco CCW Sales Order can be transmitted to Meraki as multiple Meraki orders due to the below scenarios and will ship separately. Shipping charges will be billed per Meraki order, not per the SO as a whole.</p><ul>  <li>Duplicate PID</li><li>Different License duration</li><li>Different license addition for MX only (ENT/SEC)</li><li>Different ship ID address</li><li>Different end user ID</li><li>Different request ship date</li><li>Different freight account #</li><li>Different ship method</li></ul></div> <div><h5>  P.O. Boxes</h5><p>  For most addresses, PO Boxes are not acceptable delivery addresses. If your shipping address must include a PO Box, Cisco Meraki cannot guarantee delivery.</p></div> <div><h5>  Sales Tax and VAT</h5><p>  In accordance with applicable law, Cisco Meraki collects sales tax or VAT in regions where Cisco Meraki has a presence. Sales tax or VAT will be applied to the total amount of the order and is based on the shipment’s destination and local sales tax or VAT rates.</p></div> <div><h5>  Special Delivery Requirements</h5><p>  In case you require any special service for your delivery such as a lift gate or indoor delivery service, or have special export/import requirements, please make sure to let your seller know to include this information on the PO or open a case on the <a href="http://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com" target="_blank"> Cisco Customer Service Portal  </a>prior order submission to allow sufficient time for the Cisco-Meraki shipping team to review and advise.</p></div> <div><h5>  International Certifications</h5><p>  Cisco Meraki has products certified in countries all over the world.  If you have specific questions regarding Cisco Meraki certifications, please contact your sales representative.</p></div> <div><h5>  Canceling or Modifying an Order</h5><p>  Orders can be modified or canceled before they have entered the shipping process. Once the shipment is in transit the shipping address can no longer be modified. Please take special care when processing the order to ensure the shipping address is correct and able to accept the delivery. However, if you do require adjustments prior to the shipment, please contact your seller/reseller/distributor or open an urgent case in the <a href="http://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com" target="_blank"> Cisco Customer Service Portal </a> as soon as possible. You may be responsible for any applicable adjustment, handling and/or shipping fees if applicable.</p></div> <div><h4>  Shipping and Delivery</h4></div> <div><h5>  Shipping Confirmation</h5><p>  Once your order has been shipped, a shipping notification email will be sent to the email listed in your Purchase Order, containing the tracking number of the shipment and the License Key. In case you ordered the license separately from the hardware product, the License Key will be sent on a separate email.</p></div> <div><h5>  Shipping Methods</h5><p>  Opt In (Cisco-routed) program allows the customer to rely on Cisco’s preferred carrier network, typically gives full end to end tracking visibility for parcel shipments, most freight shipments, and eliminates the need for partner/customer carrier information to be provided. However, the Cisco-routed program does not place liability for lost/damaged shipments wholly on Cisco Meraki. To determine when risk/liability is transferred, refer to the Incoterms. Once ownership of the goods has changed from Cisco Meraki per the Incoterms, goods should not be sent back to Cisco without first obtaining a <a href="/support/policies#return-policy-and-requesting-a-rma" target="_blank"> Return Material Authorization </a> (RMA) from Cisco.</p></div> <p><p>  Opt Out (self-routed) shipping preference allows the partner or customer to select their own carrier. Cisco Meraki has the ability to ship with most carriers, and the shipping cost will be the responsibility of the bill to party. If there are any concerns with the carrier selected, Cisco Meraki will contact the partner or customer.</p></p> <div><h5>  Incoterms, Duties & Taxes</h5><p>  Cisco Meraki will send shipments with a variety of Incoterms depending on the customer agreement. Incoterms determine and differentiate between the seller’s and the buyer’s responsibility. In the majority of cases, the “bill to” party on the order will be the importer of record and will be responsible for all duties & taxes, VAT, brokerage or other fees. In some cases, third party billing for duty & tax is not available in the destination country and the receiver/”ship to” will be responsible for these fees.</p></div> <div><h5>  Loss/Damage </h5><p>  In the unlikely scenario that you receive your delivery damaged or missing cartons, please accept the shipment and notate as such with the carrier upon delivery. Upon receiving the shipment, take photos to provide supporting information when filing a RMA claim with <a href="http://customerservice.cloudapps.cisco.com" target="_blank"> Cisco Customer Service </a> to assist in the investigation. </p></div> <div><h4>  Country Specific Information and Transit Times</h4><p>  Each country can have variations in transit time, available ship services and special requirements.
