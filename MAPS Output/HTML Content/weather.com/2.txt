</li></ul><p>  We may collect and use information, some of which may be considered personal data, in order to operate the Services and to maximize your experience, including to:
</p><ul>  <li>Facilitate your access to and use of the Services, including personalizing the Services, features and content;</li><li>Analyze and measure how you use the Services;</li><li>Deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements;</li><li>Manage Services’ operations;</li><li>Help diagnose technical problems;</li><li>Recognize repeat visitors;</li><li>Provide location-based services (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D.  </a> below for further details); and</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Provide alerts and notifications.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You may choose not to provide us with certain information; by doing so, however, you may not be able to receive the full range of Services from us. We collect information in the following ways:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> User Account Registration and Subscription </em>. When you choose to register an account, you will be required to provide your email address and first name. Your email address will be used for marketing communication and newsletter distribution with your consent. At the time of registration, you may choose to provide us with optional data. If you choose to purchase a subscription offering, you will be required to provide information to complete the purchase, such as credit card information.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Information Provided by You. </em> You may choose to provide us with information, some of which may be personal data, when you interact with the Services in the following ways:
</li><li>Send us an email message or complete an inquiry form — for example, you might email us for customer support (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 11 </a>) or to initiate a data rights request (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 6 </a>), and we will only use your email address to respond;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Submit a comment, leave feedback, or send us a photo or video — for example, you might submit a photo of a weather event that we may post on the Services for others to enjoy;
			Special Note about Content Submissions. The Services may, from time to time, offer options for you and other users to post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings, or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, "Submissions"). Any information in your Submissions, including geolocation information, personal data, tags, or other metadata may become publicly available and can be read, collected, or used by others. We cannot control and are not responsible for how others may use the information contained in your Submissions. You may delete certain data, including metadata, from your Submissions prior to providing them to the Services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Interact with the Services — we may collect information you provide when you interact with content available on our Services; for example, you might set a “home” location so that every time you visit the Services, you are automatically displayed the weather for that home location, or you may choose to interact with optional polls or surveys, or you may choose to search for a location; and we may use that information to personalize the Services you visit, analyze and measure how you use the Services, deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements; and</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Engage with interactive advertising — we may receive the information you provide when you submit oral or written questions or comments via the interactive ads that are placed on the Services or on third-party platforms; and we may share this information with our advertisers where required by applicable law.</li><li>Exercise a data subject rights request – to enable us to verify your identity and respond to your request, we may request additional information such as name and address.
</li><li><em> Automatic Collection. </em> We also collect certain information through automated means.
		Some of the information we collect through automated means may, whether alone or combined with other data, be personal data. For example, we automatically collect:
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Information about your device and device capabilities;</li><li>Information about your device operating system;</li><li>Information about your browser;</li><li>Information about how you use and interact with the Services;</li><li>Your activities on the Services;</li><li>IP address;</li><li>Advertising identifiers;</li><li>Mobile or Internet Carrier;</li><li>Browser type;</li><li>Browser identifier; and</li><li>Referring URL.
</li><li><em> Location Information. </em> We may collect location information to provide you with location-based services (such as severe weather alerts, air quality, and other weather information), and conduct analytics to improve the Services. We may also use the collected location information to show you content (including advertisements) that are relevant to your geographic location. The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Web/Mobile Web Use of Location Information </strong> – If you are accessing the Services through the Site, including via your mobile web browser, we may detect your general location based on your device’s IP address information, so that we can automatically show you the weather for your approximated area. Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Site would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If the collection is allowed on mobile web, it may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or if your browser blocks the collection by default, then only your general location information is collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you searched (i.e., “contextual location”).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Mobile App/In-Vehicle App Use of Location Information </strong> - If you access the Services on your mobile device or automotive infotainment system and consent to sharing location information with our application, we may directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter or information about the vehicle. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow any of The Weather Channel mobile applications or The Weather Channel in-vehicle application to directly collect location information while the application is running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. This may allow us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be traveling, in addition to other Services. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the application from your device. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive select alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for the mobile apps or in-vehicle app is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services, (last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Data Vendor Use of Location Information </strong> - Our service providers, and <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors and Analytics Vendors </a> (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2  </a> for more information) may also collect location information through the Services. We may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3 </a>. Refer to The Weather Channel In- Vehicle Application <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 17 </a> for more information about vendor use of location data for the in-vehicle application.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Alerts and Notifications. </em> Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications (or in-vehicle app notifications) for weather-related or product updates, news stories, and special offers. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your device/browser information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains, including location information shared with the in-vehicle application (either precise location or contextual/searched location).
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your device/browser, in-vehicle application, or the particular Service for which you registered, or by deleting the application.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><i> Information from  </i><a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Analytics Vendors </a><i> ,  </i><a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a><i> , and Advertisers. </i> Where legally permissible, we may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Analytics Vendors and Advertising Vendors </a> (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2 </a> for more information) and advertisers. We may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collect with information from public or third-party sources. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal data that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>Data Collection Technologies and Consumer Choice
</li></ul><p>  We and third parties acting on our behalf, or on behalf of advertisers or vendors, use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior. These technologies enable us to personalize your experience, advertisements, and provide you with requested forecast data. We follow the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ("DAAC"), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance ("EDAA").
</p></div> <p><p>  We work with a variety of advertising services that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the Services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) on our behalf or on behalf of advertisers (<a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> ”Advertising Vendors” </a>) in order to serve relevant ads. <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> use various technologies on the Services to (among other purposes): track how the Services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the Services; link users' devices (i.e., cross-device or cross-platform tracking); and serve more relevant ads on and within the Services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit. <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the Services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements. More information about this type of advertising that is tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across other apps or websites (“personalized advertising”) is available from the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it/" target="_blank">  Network Advertising Initiative's website - https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it/ </a>.
</p></p> <p><p>  We also work with certain entities that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the Services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the Services (<a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> “Analytics Vendors” </a>).
</p></p> <p><p>  Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and our vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Information Saved by Other Technologies </em>
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our Services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services. The data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cookies: </strong> Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and stored within your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies. Some cookies on our Services collect IP and MAC addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank"> "All About Cookies" guide - https://www.allaboutcookies.org/ </a>. The cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways:
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies
			These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Services and its features.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 2: Performance Cookies
			These cookies collect information about how you use the Services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages). In general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you. However, some such cookies may collect GeoIP or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 3: Functionality Cookies
			These cookies allow Services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news). These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the Services.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 4: Targeting Cookies
			These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 5: Social Network Cookies
			These cookies are generally generated by content embeds. They allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Web beacons: </strong> Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.
</li><li><strong> Web Storage: </strong> We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device.

</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li><em> Use of Advertising Identifiers </em>
</li></ul><p>  We and our <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> may collect information about usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising. An advertising identifier is a randomly-generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device. Advertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number.
</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Your Choices Around Cookies, Advertising Identifiers, and Other Technologies Used by Vendors </em>
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You have the ability to control how your data is used, including for personalized advertising, in the following ways:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Vendors </em>: This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of vendors outside of our Services and we do not control vendors’ technologies. We provide links to more information about vendors’ privacy practices and any available opt outs <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> here </a>.
</li><li><em> Browser settings </em>: Your web browser may allow you to manage your cookies and local storage to control access to data about your online activity. We encourage you to check your browser’s “Help” feature to learn how to block, disable, and delete cookies.

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Device settings </em>: The Android and iOS versions 6 to 13 mobile device operating systems allow you to control how your device’s advertising identifier is used to support or deliver personalized advertising. The iOS versions 14 and above mobile device operating systems allow you to control use of the advertising identifier and “tracking;” learn about tracking from Apple at Settings > Privacy > Tracking > Learn More
</li><li>Android device settings (version 2.3 and above): “Opt out of Ads Personalization” by following the instructions provided by Google <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269" target="_blank"> here - https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269 </a></li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>iOS device settings (versions 6 to 13): “Limit Ad Tracking” at Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking</li><li>iOS device settings (versions 14 and above): “Tracking” permissions at Settings > Privacy > Tracking

</li></ul><p>  The opt outs described above are device- or browser-specific and may not be available for all devices. So, if you opt out on your mobile device, you may continue to receive personalized advertising on your desktop computer or other devices. If you choose to opt out, you will still see ads, but the ads will not be based on your activities across other apps and websites you use.
</p></div> <p><p>  The automotive in-vehicle infotainment system (device) includes permissions for location data and notifications. The Weather Channel in-vehicle application does not provide advertising. Refer to <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 17 </a> for more information about The Weather Channel in-vehicle application.

</p></p> <p><p>  You can also opt out of future information collection from the Services by adjusting the settings on your device, ceasing use of the Service on web, or un-installing the relevant application.
</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Industry Group Opt-Outs </em>: Some industry organizations offer centralized tools where you can opt out of the use of your data by multiple vendors at once. For more information about Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out tools to assist you in managing choices for participating companies that use cookies, visit the following sites:

</p></p> <p><p>  Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.
</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Do Not Track </em>: Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and in general the signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance. As a result, we will not recognize requests coming through as DNT signals.
</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Marketing and Newsletter Communications </em>: If you have previously subscribed to any of our marketing or newsletter communications with your email address, you have three options to opt-out of this correspondence as detailed below:
</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Withdraw consent from your account settings page which can be accessed on the Site or by following the “update my preferences” button at the bottom of your emails</li><li>Utilize the “unsubscribe” button at the bottom of your emails</li><li>Request a data delete from our Manage Data Rights page which will completely delete your account (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 6  </a> for more information)

</li><li>How We Share or Disclose Your Information with Vendors
</li></ul></div> <div><p>  We may also share any information collected from the Services including aggregated or statistical data that we may generate from such information in the following ways:
</p><ul>  <li><em> Service Providers. </em> When your data is collected on the Services, it may be shared with select <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Analytics Vendors and Advertising Vendors </a> that assist us with marketing or advertising campaigns for our brands, and providers of services that assist us with our business operations, with the provision of the Services, or in delivering you the features and functionality that you have requested ("Technology Vendors"). These service providers include companies that support our advertising programs for our brands, provide data storage, support customer service, assist with audience research and product development, facilitate, or deliver materials to you, and provide map content for the Services. Our service providers are authorized to use the data that we provide to them only to carry out and improve the service they are providing for us. All such service providers are contractually bound by us to keep the data confidential. See <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 17 </a> for information about service providers for The Weather Channel in-vehicle application.
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services.  </em>At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors. We also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by their privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links. </em> Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad. In that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Some of the Services allow users to interact with other websites or services. You may remain logged into those other sites and services until you log off. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone, and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. We do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information. As we do not control these third-parties' data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any).
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> We may share information we collect with Advertising Vendors, including those used by our advertisers, so that they can: (i) deliver and/or support the delivery of relevant content or ads on our websites or apps, advertisers’ websites or apps, or other third-party websites or apps; (ii) analyze and report on content or ads users see or interact with, and; (iii) improve their services. <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> may also collect information via the technologies discussed in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2  </a> above or via interactive ads. The information may include data about how users interact with the Services, information users provide via interactive ads, the content and ads users have viewed, users' activities on other websites and online services, and physical places users have visited.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Bundling Companions. </em> We have partnered with several publishers and businesses to provide you with an option to bundle (“the Bundle”) their subscriptions through your registered account and/or on an offer page available on our Services. You will need to manage your account for the Bundle on our Services. By subscribing to the Bundle, you agree that certain account information (e.g., your e-mail address, name, and account status) will be provided to each Bundling Companion for purposes of assessing your eligibility for the Bundle, activating, administering, improving your experience with the Bundle and each Bundling Companion, and communicating confirmation that the Bundle has been activated. Any such account information received by the Bundling Companion will be subject to each Bundling Companion’s respective Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Purchase or Sale of Businesses. </em> We continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business. If we buy, merge, reorganize or sell any business or assets, personal data and non-personal information will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction.
</li><li><em> Aggregated Information. </em> As part of the Services, we may aggregate or otherwise alter information (including location information) that is collected from the Services so that it does not identify your device and cannot reasonably be linked to your device. We may use or share such information with third parties for research or commercial purposes (e.g., analyzing trends based on foot traffic). As explained in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D. </a> above, you can turn off the collection of location data through your device settings.

</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>Other Limitations on Privacy
</li></ul><p>  We, our affiliates, or our service providers may disclose your data without your permission (i) pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders or otherwise to comply with law; (ii) where we believe an individual's rights, property, or safety or security is at risk; (iii) if we find that your actions violate our <a href="/legal" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a> (available in application settings for The Weather Channel in-vehicle application) or any of our other legal rights; or (iv) where otherwise required or permitted by applicable law (which may include a lawful access request by U.S. or foreign courts, governments, or law enforcement agencies).
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Retention Period
</li></ul><p>  We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide and develop the Services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain information that no longer identifies you indefinitely.
</p><ul>  <li>Data Rights
</li></ul><p>  You can request to access, obtain a portable copy of, correct, or delete data related to your stored preferences and your use of the Services. Please note that we may take steps to verify your identity to enable us to respond to your request.
</p></div> <p><p>  Because we do not require users to register in order to use our Services, if you use more than one of our Services, or if you use our Services on more than one device or web browser, you will need to manage your data for each of the Services separately. If you have a registered account and are logged in to your account at the time of the request, we will be able to retrieve data related to your use of the Services while you were logged in and all other devices you have used while logged into your registered account.

</li></ul><p>  The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA") as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA”) hereafter referred to as CPRA, requires certain disclosures that are covered above in this Privacy Policy. This section provides an overview of the information required by CPRA and how to exercise your CPRA rights if you are a California resident.
</p><ul>  <li><em> Disclosures about the use of your Personal Information </em>

</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  We collect Personal Information in order to:
</p><ul>  <li>Facilitate your access to and use of the Services, including personalizing the Services, features and content;</li><li>Analyze and measure how you use the Services;</li><li>Deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements;</li><li>Manage Services’ operations;</li><li>Help diagnose technical problems;</li><li>Recognize repeat visitors;</li><li>Provide location-based services (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D.  </a> above for further details); and</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Provide alerts and notifications.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3  </a> of this Privacy Policy describes how we share or disclose your information with vendors.
</p></p> <p><p>  In the past twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information as defined by the CPRA for our business purposes to our <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a>, <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Analytics Vendors </a>, and <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Technology Vendors </a>
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Identifiers such as an online identifier or IP address;</li><li>Commercial information relating to your use of the Services;</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information relating to your use of the Services;</li><li>Geolocation data; and</li><li>Precise geolocation data.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition, in the past twelve months, to deliver personalized content and marketing communications, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information as defined by the CPRA for our business purposes to our <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors and Analytics Vendors </a>:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Identifiers such as first name or email; and</li><li>Inferences drawn from the use of the Services.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Note that if you have registered an account with us and/or purchased a subscription offering, in order to provide you with the registered account and/or paid subscription, in the past twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information as defined by the CPRA for our business purposes to our <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Technology Vendors </a>.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  The CPRA defines the terms “sell” and “sale” broadly to include the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for something of value, even if no money is exchanged. We do not sell users’ Personal Information as the term “sell” is commonly understood (i.e., for monetary consideration). However, we do allow <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> to use your Personal Information for certain purposes other than providing and improving advertising services for our apps and websites (described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3.D.  </a> of this Privacy Policy), which is considered a sale under CPRA. This is the only way that we sell Personal Information under the CPRA, and we do not engage in any other sales of Personal Information under the CPRA. The CPRA also defines “share” and “sharing” to specifically mean the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.
</p></p> <p><p>  In the past twelve months, to deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, we have sold or shared the following categories of Personal Information as defined by the CPRA to our <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a>:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Identifiers such as an online identifier or IP address;</li><li>Commercial information relating to your use of the Services;</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information relating to your use of the Services;</li><li>Geolocation data;</li><li>Precise geolocation data; and</li><li>Inferences.

You also can opt out of the sale or sharing of your information for personalized advertising through the available web- and app-related opt-outs listed above in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2.C </a>.
</p></p> <p><p>  As described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D </a>., we may also use or disclose to specific data vendors your precise geolocation data, which is considered Sensitive Personal Information under the CPRA, to create zip code-level audience segments based on your preferences and characteristics. Information on how you can limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information is provided below (<a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 12.B. </a> “Limit Use of your Sensitive Personal Information”).
</p></p> <p><p>  As described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 7 </a> of this Privacy Policy, we do not knowingly sell or share Personal Information from children under 16 years of age.
</p></p> <p><p>  Some data vendors may control the collection of Personal Information on this Site and on our Services. Our Data Vendors page (<a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> https://weather.com/data-vendors </a>) provides more details.

</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Opt out of sale or sharing of your Personal Information. </em> You will be opted in by default to the sale or sharing of Personal Information. You can opt out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information at any time in the following ways. If you are a registered user, your opt out selection will be associated to your registered account and will follow you across devices when logged in. If you do not have an account or are using the Services without logging into your account, you will have to opt out from each browser or device where you access the Services.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Note that if you are traveling outside of California within the U.S., you may see the option to “Opt Out of Targeted Advertising” displayed instead of “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.” While we use different wording outside of California within the U.S., functionalities remain the same so opting out of targeted advertising and the sale of personal data will also opt you out of sale or sharing of personal information.

</span></span> <p><p>  We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) when you are located in the U.S. and will treat it as an opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information preference signal. The signal will apply to your browser and will take precedence over any previously provided choice on the Site or our Services. If you have a registered account, your GPC signal will be associated to your account as an “opted-out” selection and will follow you across devices when logged in.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Users of The Weather Channel In-Vehicle Application: please note that the application does not sell or share personal information as defined by CPRA, therefore the opt out of sale or sharing of personal information does not apply.

</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>U.S. State Data Privacy Laws Notice
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you are a U.S. resident, we process your personal data in accordance with applicable U.S. state data privacy laws. For California residents, please see our “California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) Notice,” <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 12 </a>. The following additional states have enacted privacy laws we comply with:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Virginia Consumer Privacy Act (“VCDPA”), effective January 1, 2023</li><li>Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), effective July 1, 2023</li><li>Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), effective July 1, 2023
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Please note that state laws vary, and additional states are actively passing consumer data privacy laws, and we will continue to update our disclosures, processes and this notice as the laws and rules are finalized.
</p></p> <p><p>  As described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank">  Section 1  </a> of this Privacy Policy, we collect and use certain information, some of which may be considered Personal Information, in order to operate the Services and to maximize your experience. For more specificity on the categories of data we share, and the purposes, please see the additional descriptions in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 12 </a> (“California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) Notice”). Please see below for a summary of our privacy practices in the U.S.
</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Opt Out
		</li></ul><p>  Certain state data privacy laws define the terms “sell” and “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal data for valuable consideration, even if money is not exchanged. We do not sell users’ personal data as the term “sell” is commonly understood (i.e., for monetary consideration). However, we do allow <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> to use your personal data for certain purposes other than providing and improving advertising services for our apps and websites (described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3.D.  </a> of this Privacy Policy), which is considered a “sale” under certain state data privacy laws. This is the only way that we “sell” personal data.
</p></div> <p><p>  Certain state data privacy laws define targeted advertising as displaying advertisements to a specific audience based on preferences or interests. The Weather Channel allows some <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Advertising Vendors </a> to use your personal information for certain purposes other than providing and improving advertising services for our apps and websites (described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3.D.  </a>), which is considered targeted advertising under certain state data privacy laws.
</p></p> <p><p>  Note that if you are traveling around the U.S., you may see different combinations for options to “Opt Out of Targeted Advertising” and “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.” While we use different wording in certain states within the U.S., functionalities remain the same so opting out of targeted advertising will also opt you out of sale or sharing.
</p></p> <p><p>  We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) for U.S.- based users; if GPC is enabled, we recognize this as an “opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information” (California residents, See <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 12 </a>) or as an “opt out of targeted advertising and the sale of personal data” request (non-California U.S. residents).

This Privacy Policy went into effect on January 1, 2023.</p><p>  TWC Product and Technology, LLC, doing business as The Weather Company, an IBM Business, (sometimes, "we" or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is important, and we encourage you to carefully read it.</p><p>  This Privacy Policy discloses how we collect, use, and share data that we gather related to your interaction with this website (the "Site") and on our software applications, mobile applications, and other websites and services that reference or link to this Privacy Policy (together, the "Services").

We may seek your consent by other means such as by asking you to click on a button or to change a setting. Where we do so, we will also offer you a way to revoke your consent.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Why and How We Collect and Use Personal Data and Other Information
</li></ul><p>  In order to operate the Services and to maximize your experience, we may collect and use information, some of which may be considered personal data. Additionally, we use your personal data in order to:
</p><ul>  <li>Facilitate your access to and use of the Services, including personalizing the Services, features and content;</li><li>Analyze and measure how you use the Services;</li><li>Deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements;</li><li>Manage Services’ operations;</li><li>Help diagnose technical problems;</li><li>Recognize repeat visitors;</li><li>Provide location-based services (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D.  </a> below for further details); and</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Provide alerts and notifications.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Please note that you may choose not to provide us with certain information; by doing so, however, you may not be able to receive the full range of Services from us. We collect information in the following ways:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> User Account Registration and Subscription </em>. When you choose to register an account, you will be required to provide your email address and first name. Your email address will be used for marketing communication and newsletter distribution with your consent. At the time of registration, you may choose to provide us with optional data. If you choose to purchase a subscription offering, you will be required to provide information to complete the purchase, such as credit card information.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Information Provided by You. </em> You may choose to provide us with information, some of which may be personal data, when you interact with the Services in the following ways:
</li><li>Send us an email message or complete an inquiry form — for example, you might email us for customer support (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 11 </a>) or to initiate a data rights request (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 6 </a>), and we will only use your email address to respond;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Submit a comment, leave feedback, or send us a photo or video — for example, you might submit a photo of a weather event that we may post on the Services so others can enjoy it;
			Special Note about Content Submissions. The Services may from time to time offer areas where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings, or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, "Submissions"). Any geolocation information, tags, or other metadata in Submissions may become publicly available. Any information, including personal data, in your Submissions can be read, collected, or used by others. We cannot control and are not responsible for how others may use the information contained in your Submissions.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Interact with the Services — we may collect information you provide when you interact with content available on our Services; for example, you might set a “home” location so that every time you visit the Services, you are automatically displayed the weather for that home location, or you may choose to interact with optional polls or surveys; and we may use that information to personalize the Services you visit, analyze and measure how you use the Services, deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements; and</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Engage with interactive advertising — we may receive the information you provide when you submit oral or written questions or comments via the interactive ads that are placed on the Services or on third-party platforms; and we may share this information with our advertisers where required by applicable law.
</li><li><em> Automatic Collection. </em> We also collect certain information through automated means.
		Some of the information we collect through automated means may, whether alone or combined with other data, be personal data. For example, we automatically collect:
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Information about your device and device capabilities;</li><li>Information about your device operating system;</li><li>Information about your browser;</li><li>Information about how you use and interact with the Services;</li><li>Your activities on the Services;</li><li>IP address;</li><li>Advertising identifiers;</li><li>Mobile or Internet Carrier;</li><li>Browser type;</li><li>Browser identifier; and</li><li>Referring URL.
</li><li><em> Location Information. </em> We may collect location information to provide you with location-based services (such as severe weather alerts, air quality, and other weather information), and conduct analytics to improve the Services. We may also use the collected location information to show you content (including advertisements) that are relevant to your geographic location. The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Web/Mobile Web Use of Location Information </strong> – If you are accessing the Services through the Site, including via your mobile web browser, we may detect your general location based on your device’s IP address information, so that we can automatically show you the weather for your approximated area. Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Site would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If the collection is allowed on mobile web, it may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or your browser blocks the collection by default, only your general location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you have searched (i.e. “contextual location”).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Mobile App Use of Location Information </strong> - If you access the Services on your mobile device and consent to sharing location information with our mobile application, we may directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow any of The Weather Channel mobile applications to directly collect location information while the mobile applications are running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. This may allow us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be traveling, in addition to other Services. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for mobile apps is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services (e.g. last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Data Vendor Use of Location Information </strong> - Our service providers, and Advertising and Analytics Vendors (see <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2  </a> for more information) may also collect location information through the Services. We may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3 </a>.
</li><li><em> Alerts and Notifications. </em> Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications for weather-related or product updates, news stories, and special offers. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your device information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered, or by deleting the application.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Information from Analytics and Advertising Vendors and Advertisers. </em> Where legally permissible, we may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from Analytics and Advertising Vendors (See <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2 </a>) and advertisers. We may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collect with information from public or third-party sources. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal data that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>Data Collection Technologies and Consumer Choice
</li></ul><p>  We and third parties acting on our behalf, or on behalf of advertisers or vendors, use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior. These technologies enable us to tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more meaningful and to offer accurate forecast data to everyone, everywhere, free of charge. We follow the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ("DAAC"), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance ("EDAA").
</p></div> <p><p>  We work with a variety of advertising services that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the Services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) on our behalf or on behalf of advertisers (Advertising Vendors) in order to serve relevant ads. Advertising Vendors use various technologies on the Services to (among other purposes): track how the Services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the Services; link users' devices (i.e., cross-device or cross-platform tracking); and serve more relevant ads on and within the Services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit. Advertising Vendors may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the Services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements. More information about this type of advertising that is tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across other apps or websites (“personalized advertising”) is available from the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it/" target="_blank">  Network Advertising Initiative's website </a>.
</p></p> <p><p>  We also work with certain entities that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the Services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the Services ("Analytics Vendors").
</p></p> <p><p>  Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and our vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Information Saved by Other Technologies </em>
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our Services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services. The data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cookies: </strong> Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and stored within your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies. Some cookies on our Services collect IP and MAC addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. For more information, please visit this “<a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank"> All About Cookies </a>” guide. The cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways:
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies
			These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Services and its features.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 2: Performance Cookies
			These cookies collect information about how you use the Services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages). In general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you. However, some such cookies may collect GeoIP or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 3: Functionality Cookies
			These cookies allow Services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news). These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the Services.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 4: Targeting Cookies
			These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests.
</p></p> <p><p>  Category 5: Social Network Cookies
			These cookies are generally generated by content embeds. They allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Web beacons: </strong> Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.
</li><li><strong> Web Storage: </strong> We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device.

</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li><em> Use of Advertising Identifiers </em>
</li></ul><p>  We and our Advertising Vendors may collect information about usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising. An advertising identifier is a randomly-generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device. Advertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number.
</p><ul>  <li><em> Your Choices Around Cookies, Advertising Identifiers, and Other Technologies Used by Vendors </em>
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  You have the ability to control how your data is used, including for personalized advertising, in the following ways:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Vendors </em>: This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of vendors outside of our Services and we do not control vendors’ technologies. We provide links to more information about vendors’ privacy practices and any available opt outs <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> here </a>.
</li><li><em> Browser settings </em>: Your web browser may allow you to manage your cookies and local storage to control access to data about your online activity. We encourage you to check your browser’s “Help” feature to learn how to block, disable, and delete cookies. Please note that for technical reasons, if you delete or block certain cookies, some features of the site may be unavailable or may not function as intended.

</p></p> <p><p>  Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data.

</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Do Not Track </em>: Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and in general the signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance. As a result, we will not recognize requests coming through as DNT signals. We, however, do recognize and honor Global Privacy Control.

</li><li>How We Share or Disclose Your Information with Vendors
</li></ul><p>  We may also share any information collected from the Services including aggregated or statistical data that we may generate from such information in the following ways:
</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Service Providers. </em> When your data is collected on the Services, it may be shared with select Analytics Vendors and Advertising Vendors that assist us with marketing or advertising campaigns for our brands, and providers of services that assist us with our business operations, with the provision of the Services, or in delivering you the features and functionality that you have requested ("Technology Vendors"). These service providers include companies that support our advertising programs for our brands, provide data storage, support customer service, assist with audience research and product development, facilitate, or deliver materials to you, and provide map content for the Services. Our service providers are authorized to use the data that we provide to them only to carry out and improve the service they are providing for us. All such service providers are contractually bound by us to keep the data confidential. 
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services.  </em>At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors. We also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by their privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links. </em> Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad. In that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Some of the Services allow users to interact with other websites or services. You may remain logged into those other sites and services until you log off. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone, and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. We do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information. As we do not control these third-parties' data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any).
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Advertising Vendors. </em> We may share information we collect with Advertising Vendors, including those used by our advertisers, so that they can: (i) deliver and/or support the delivery of relevant content or ads on our websites or apps, advertisers’ websites or apps, or other third-party websites or apps; (ii) analyze and report on content or ads users see or interact with, and; (iii) improve their services. Advertising Vendors may also collect information via the technologies discussed in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2  </a> above or via interactive ads. The information may include data about how users interact with the Services, information users provide via interactive ads, the content and ads users have viewed, users' activities on other websites and online services, and physical places users have visited.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Bundling Companions. </em> We have partnered with several publishers and businesses to provide you with an option to bundle (“the Bundle”) their subscriptions through your registered account and/or on an offer page available on our Services. You will need to manage your account for the Bundle on our Services. By subscribing to the Bundle, you agree that certain account information (e.g., your e-mail address, name, and account status) will be provided to each Bundling Companion for purposes of assessing your eligibility for the Bundle, activating, administering, improving your experience with the Bundle and each Bundling Companion, and communicating confirmation that the Bundle has been activated. Any such account information received by the Bundling Companion will be subject to each Bundling Companion’s respective Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Purchase or Sale of Businesses. </em> We continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business. If we buy, merge, reorganize or sell any business or assets, personal data and non-personal information will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction.
</li><li><em> Aggregated Information. </em> As part of the Services, we may aggregate or otherwise alter information (including location information) that is collected from the Services so that it does not identify your device and cannot reasonably be linked to your device. We may use or share such information with third parties for research or commercial purposes (e.g., analyzing trends based on foot traffic). As explained in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D. </a> above, you can turn off the collection of location data through your device settings.

</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>Other Limitations on Privacy
</li></ul><p>  We, our affiliates, or our service providers may disclose your data without your permission (i) pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders or otherwise to comply with law; (ii) where we believe an individual's rights, property, or safety or security is at risk; (iii) if we find that your actions violate our <a href="/legal" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a> or any of our other legal rights; or (iv) where otherwise required or permitted by applicable law (which may include a lawful access request by U.S. or foreign courts, governments, or law enforcement agencies).
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Retention Period
</li></ul><p>  We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide and develop the Services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain information that no longer identifies you indefinitely.
</p><ul>  <li>Data Rights
</li></ul><p>  You can request to access, obtain a portable copy of, correct, or delete data related to your stored preferences and your use of the Services. Please note that we may take steps to verify your identity before you can make a request. Because we do not require users to register in order to use our Services, if you use more than one of our Services, or if you use our Services on more than one device or web browser, you will need to manage your data for each of the Services separately. If you have a registered account and are logged in to your account at the time of the request, we will be able to retrieve data related to your use of the Services while you were logged in and all other devices you have used while logged into your registered account.

</p></p> <p><p>  As permitted by law or to provide our Services, we do not delete data we use to:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Complete transactions requiring data such as billing information or transaction histories;</li><li>Respond to customer support inquiries;</li><li>Detect and prevent security incidents, identify, and repair errors that impair functionality of our Services (e.g., log files, error diagnostics); and</li><li>Comply with legal obligations.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Note to registered users and subscribers: At this time, we cannot delete data directly associated with your account without deleting your account. If you wish to correct information related to your account or delete your account and all data associated with it, please click <a href="/member/settings" target="_blank"> here </a>. Please note we associate to your account every device (including different browsers) you log into with the sole exception of local data stored on your devices. Performing a deletion request will delete data we have on all other devices you have used while logged into your registered account, and similarly, an access request will return data from all these same devices.
</p></p> <p><p>  In the event that you consider our processing of data related to your use of the Services not to be compliant with the applicable data protection laws, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@weather.com" target="_blank"> privacy@weather.com </a> or lodge a complaint with the relevant data protection authority.

</li></ul><p>  The Services are hosted on servers inside and outside the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, information that we collect (including through cookies) will be processed and stored in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the data protection and privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen. Subject to applicable law, by using our Services and providing information to us, you consent to the transfer to and processing of information in the United States and other jurisdictions. Where necessary under applicable law, we may employ appropriate cross-border transfer methods governing personal data.
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Our Commitment to Security

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3  </a> of our Privacy Policy describes how we share or disclose your information with vendors.
</p></p> <p><p>  In the past twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information as defined by the CPRA for our business purposes to our Advertising, Analytics, and Technology Vendors:
		 

		</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Identifiers such as an online identifier or IP address;</li><li>Commercial information relating to your use of the Services;</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity information relating to your use of the Services;</li><li>Geolocation data; and</li><li>Precise geolocation data.

</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Identifiers such as first name or email; and</li><li>Inferences drawn from the use of the Services.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Note that if you have registered an account with us and/or purchased a subscription offering, in order to provide you with the registered account and/or paid subscription, in the past twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information as defined by the CPRA for our business purposes to our <a href="/data-vendors" target="_blank"> Technology Vendors </a>.

We do not sell users’ Personal Information as the term “sell” is commonly understood. However, we do allow Advertising Vendors to use your Personal Information for certain purposes other than providing and improving advertising services for our apps and websites (described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 3.D.  </a> of our Privacy Policy), which is considered a sale under CPRA. This is the only way that we sell Personal Information under the CPRA, and we do not engage in any other sales of Personal Information under the CPRA. The CPRA also defines “share” and “sharing” to specifically mean the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.

You also can opt out of the sale or sharing of your information for personalized advertising through the available web- and app-related opt-outs listed above in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 2.C </a>.
</p></p> <p><p>  As described in <a href="javascript:;" target="_blank"> Section 1.D </a>., we may also use or disclose to specific data vendors your precise geolocation data, which is considered Sensitive Personal Information under the CPRA, to create zip code-level audience segments based on your preferences and characteristics. Information on how you can limit the use or disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information is provided below (“Limit Use of your Sensitive Personal Information”).

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Note that if you are traveling outside of California, you may see the option to “Opt Out of Targeted Advertising” displayed instead of “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.” While we use different wording outside of California, functionalities remain the same so opting out of targeted advertising will also opt you out of sale or sharing.
