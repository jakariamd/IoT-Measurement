  We may collect the following categories of personal information:
</p><p>  
  When you create an account or subscribe to one of our services, we may collect information,
  such as your first and last name, country of residence, email address, username, and password.

  This may include information about your use, and the use by any person(s) you authorize through

  our services, and your preferences. This can also include information you post in public forums on

  third-party platforms or devices.
</p></p> <p><p>

  digital properties (including through beacon technologies), or associated with your IP address,
  where we are permitted by law to process this information.

  Usage, viewing, technical, and device data when you visit our digital properties whether hosted

</p></p> <div><h2>  II. How We Collect Personal Information</h2><p>  
  The following describes the different ways we might collect your personal information, whether
  from you <strong> directly </strong> or <strong> automatically </strong> when interacting with our
  digital properties.
</p></div> <div><h3>  a. Personal Information You Share Directly</h3><p>  
  If you request to be contacted by a car seller, both CarGurus and the seller may collect personal
  information provided by you through the text and chat functionalities that we provide and on the
  contact forms on our site, which may include your name, email address, postal code, and telephone
  number, so that the seller can contact you to consider a car purchase or request that you submit
  a dealer review.
</p><p>  
  If you are an individual user (and not acting on behalf of a car dealer) and you want to use
  our services to buy or sell a vehicle, we and/or our business partners may collect information
  provided by you in connection with that transaction, for example to create your vehicle listing,
  to verify vehicle ownership, to confirm funds availability, to process payment, to populate purchase
  and sale documents, and to provide user support. We may collect this information from entry forms

  This information may include your name, address, email address, telephone number, driver's
  license number, photo, gender, date of birth, the last four digits of your social security number,
  bank name, and bank account and routing numbers.

  data from your browser or device using tracking technologies (See <em> VI. Technologies We Use to
  Automatically Collect Personal Information </em>) that is considered personal information when you
  engage with our digital properties. We automatically collect certain browser or device technical
  data in order to deliver our services to you, and to help make sure our digital properties are
  functioning properly. This typically includes data about your browser or device's IP address,
  user agent string, your internet service provider or mobile carrier and the type of handheld or
  mobile device you use.
</p></div> <div><h2>  III. Other Ways Personal Information is Collected</h2></div> <div><h3>  a. Applications and Widgets for Social Media</h3><p>  
  We may display applications or widgets from social media providers that allow interaction or
  content sharing by their users. These widgets, such as the Facebook® "Share" or "Like" button,
  are visible to you on the page that you visit. This may allow the social media networks in which
  you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the
  network's application or widget while on our digital property. Please visit the applicable social
  media network's privacy notice to better understand their data collection practices and the choices
  they make available to you.

  In addition to social media networks, our digital properties also contain references and links
  to third-party sites that may offer information of interest. This Privacy Notice does not apply
  to those sites, and we recommend reviewing those sites' privacy notices individually.
</p></p> <div><h3>  b. Information Collected from Other Sources</h3><p>

  information that you provide or that we collect. For instance, we may collect vehicle registration
  information from public databases to support a service you have engaged us for. Other sources of
  information include third-party advertising partners, data providers or aggregators, and search
  information providers.

  See <em> VIII. Your Privacy Rights and Choices </em>
  below to learn about how you can exercise your privacy rights with CarGurus.
</p></p> <div><h2>  VI. Technologies We Use to Automatically Collect Personal Information</h2><p>  
  Along with companies we partner with, we employ pixel tags, cookies, java scripts, SDKs, local
  shared objects such as Flash (sometimes called “flash cookies”), and similar technology (“tracking
  technologies”) on our digital properties, and third-party digital properties we integrate with. These
  technologies may create unique advertising identifiers (e.g. cookie identifiers or mobile advertising
  identifiers) that reside on your browser or mobile device, and in some cases server-side. Tracking
  technologies may transmit data about your use of our digital properties, including which pages you
  interacted with, your vehicle search history, the advertisements shown to you or that you may have
  clicked on, other page view/click data, the date and time of your visit, all associated with your
  browser or mobile device's advertising identifier. These identifiers typically persist over time.
  You can set some cookie preferences through your device or browser settings but doing so may affect the
  functionality of the site.
</p></div> <p><p>  
  To learn more about how we employ these technologies and the choices you have concerning our processing
  of your personal information for digital advertising purposes, see <em> VIII. Your Privacy
  Rights and Choices </em> below.
</p></p> <p><p>  
  Consistent with <em> IV. How We Use Your Personal Information </em> above, the purposes
  for which we use tracking technologies include:
</p></p> <div><td>  Processes</td><td>  
        Make digital properties work in the way that it is expected. For example,
        we use a cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up for an account.
      
</td><td>  Authentication, Security, and Compliance</td><td>  
        Prevent fraud, protect user data from unauthorized parties, and for compliance
        with legal requirements. For example, we use cookies to determine if a suspicious
        IP address (based on geography) is logged in through your account.
      
</td></div> <div><td>  Preferences</td><td>  
        Track how our digital properties are used and remember preferences. For example,
        we monitor and store your browsing activity to customize your experience and better
        understand your vehicle shopping interests.
      
</td><td>  Notifications</td><td>  
        Allow notices of information or options that we think could improve the use of the
        site or app. For example, send out notifications of price drop in a vehicle that you
        previously showed interest in.
      
</td></div> <div><td>  Advertising</td><td>  
        Make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to our advertisers. For
        example, we may use cookies to serve you targeted ads, such as ads that are displayed
        to you based on your visits to other websites, or to tell us if you have recently
        clicked on an ad. See <em> VIII. Your Privacy Rights and Choices </em><em>  below.
       </em></td><td>  Analytics</td><td>  
        Intended to help us understand how visitors use our digital properties. For example,
        we use a cookie that tells us how our search suggestions correlate to your browsing
        while on the site or app.
      
</td></div> <div><h2>  VII. Additional U.S. State Disclosures</h2><p>  
  This section supplements the above by providing additional information about how we may
  process your personal information. Unless stated otherwise, all terms defined in our Privacy
  Notice have the same meaning below.

    and financial account number and routing number;

</p></p> <p><p>  
  We may at times receive or process personal information to create data sets that can no
  longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular
  individual or household. Where we maintain de-identified or aggregate information, we will maintain
  and use the data in de-identified or aggregate form and not attempt to re-identify the data.
</p></p> <div><h3>  a. California</h3><p>  
  We share this notice of collection to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
  (CCPA). Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Privacy Notice.
</p><p>

  activities such as those disclosed in this notice as a “sale,” we comply with applicable law as
  to such activity.

  Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address
  where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of
  personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale
  under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business
  to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.
  If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law,
  please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@cargurus.com" target="_blank"> privacy@cargurus.com </a>.

  We may work with advertising technology partners who allow us to personalize our ads
  based on your browsing behavior on our digital properties. Many of these companies are
  participants of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and/or members of the Network
  Advertising Initiative (“NAI”).  In addition to your right under your state's privacy
  law to opt out from targeted advertising by us and our own advertising partners, you can
  learn more about targeted ads provided by these companies as well as others we are not partnered
  with, and how to opt out of receiving certain targeted ads from them by visiting:

    - For targeted ads from NAI members on websites and to learn more about how to opt out from
    receiving targeted ads on your other connected devices.
  </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  
  Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted
  ads to the specific browser or device on which you made your request, it does not mean you will
  no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from other advertising technology companies or
  on your other browsers or devices that have not been opted out.
</p></p> <p><p>  
  We also partner with Amazon to deliver advertisements. You can opt out of delivery of targeted
  advertising to you by Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/adprefs" target="_blank"> here </a>. Please note
  that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be
  tailored to your specific interests.
</p></p> <p><p>  
  We may also display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook and other social
  media platforms or websites.
