The easiest way to do so is to complete and submit a <u> Data Subject Request form </u>. Alternatively, you may contact us toll free at (866) 273-8455.</p></p> <p><p>  As required under applicable law, we must take steps to verify your request before we can provide Personal Information to you, delete Personal Information, or otherwise process your request. To verify your request, we may require you to provide your name, physical address, email address, contact information, information about previous transactions, or other information necessary for verifying your identity. If you have only visited our public Sites and did not provide any Personal Information to us via a web form or through the registration process, we will need you to provide us with your IP address or device ID in order for us to determine if we have that information because we will not be able to do so from your name, physical address, email address, contact information, or previous transactions.</p></p> <p><p>  You may designate an authorized agent to request any of the above rights on your behalf. We require the agent to submit proof that they have been authorized directly by you to act on your behalf and may deny requests absent this authorization. We may also request verification of your identity.</p></p> <p><p>  If you request that we provide Personal Information to you, we will deliver it as required by law within 45 days after receipt of a verifiable request, unless we notify you that we require additional time to respond, in which case we will respond within such additional period of time required by law. We may deliver the Personal Information to you electronically or by mail at your option. If electronically, then we will deliver the information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format that allows you to transmit the information.</p></p> <p><p>  In certain situations, we may deny a request, such as if your information is needed to fulfill a pending transaction or for a legal obligation. If we deny a request, you may appeal that decision here.</p></p> <div><h2>  Contact Us</h2><p>  If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice or our Information Practices, please contact us at <u> privacy@breville.com </u> or in writing by sending your written request to:</p><p>  Breville USA, Inc.</p><p>  19400 S Western Ave.</p><p>  Torrance, CA 90501, USA</p><p>  Attn: Data Protection Officer</p><ul>  <li>Sign Up</li></ul><span>  My Breville
