      information such as a device's IP address, the time a person viewed the
      pixel, an identifier associated with the browser or device, and the type of
      browser being used. Local storage is an industry-standard technology that
      allows a website or app to store and retrieve data on a person's computer,
      mobile phone or other device. Some examples include device or HTML5 local
      storage and caching.</p></div> <div><h3>  Your Choices</h3><p>  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually

      advertisers with information about your usage of our website and our

      the Google Analytics cookie) and third party cookies (such as the
      DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on
      someone's past visits to our website. We also use Google Analytics
      Demographics and Interest Reporting, to tailor advertisements relevant to
      you based on demographic information such as age, gender, and interests.</p></p> <p><p>  You may, however, opt-out of many third party ad networks, including those
