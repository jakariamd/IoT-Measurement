Sharing your personal data</p></p> <p><p>  We do not share your personal data with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  Service providers. We use third-party service providers to help us with various operations, such as payment processing, email automation, Websites and app diagnostics, analytics, and other. As a result, some of these service providers may process personal data.</p></p> <div><p>  Some of our main long-term service providers:</p><ul>  <li>Live chat and support service platform, e.g., Zendesk (provided by Zendesk Inc.), Klaus (provided by Qualitista OÜ)</li><li>Emailing service providers, e.g., Iterable (provided by Iterable Inc.), Sendgrid (provided by Twilio Inc.)</li><li>Marketing, application analytics and diagnostics, e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics (provided by Google), AppsFlyer (provided by AppsFlyer Ltd.), Bugsnag (provided by Bugsnag Inc.)</li><li>Conversion attribution system, e.g., Hasoffers (provided by Tune Inc.)</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Payments processing, e.g., Mollymind AG, Moonflash Limited, Lagosec, Inc., Nord Security JP Co., Ltd, Checkout Ltd</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Nord partners. </strong> Sometimes our partners, for example, distributors, resellers, and app store partners, will be independent data controllers of your personal data. In such cases, the procedures established by them (e.g., terms of service and privacy policies) will apply to such relationships. In other cases we may collaborate with partners as joint controllers meaning that we jointly define the purpose and means of data processing with them. Both joint controllers are then responsible for the data processing and its compliance with applicable privacy laws.</p></p> <p><p>  We also partner with third parties to display advertising on our Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. These partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include behavioral, contextual, and generic advertising. We and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help us understand your preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.</p></p> <p><p>  Your personal data may be processed in any country in which we engage service providers and partners. When you use our Services and Websites, you understand and acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred outside of the country where you reside.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Bundled subscriptions (Third Party Services purchased through Nord) </strong>. By subscribing to the Bundled Subscription which includes Third Party Services purchased through Nord, you agree that certain purchase information (e.g., your email address, Subscription term, payment amount, and subscription ID) will be shared with the respective provider of Third Party Services for purposes of activating, administering, and provision of Third Party Services, also for improving your experience, and communicating with you about the Bundled Subscription and Third Party Services. When you use Third Party Services, your personal data is processed by the provider of Third Party Services (which acts as a separate data controller of your personal data) according to the procedures established by it and governed by its privacy policies.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Other Nord group companies. </strong> We share your personal data with other Nord group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide our Services to you. We may also share the contact information of Nord business customers (i.e., our customers which use our products as a tool for their business) with Nord group companies for marketing of their B2B products purposes (business users have a right to object to such transfer at any time).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Protection of our rights. </strong> We may disclose personal data to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against any legal claims or other complaints. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, and violations of our General Terms.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Business transfers. </strong> We may share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business or go through a corporate merger, acquisition, consolidation, asset sale, reorganization, or similar event. In these situations, Nord will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Requests for data. </strong> Any request for user data should follow an appropriate official legal process recognized by the laws of the Republic of Panama (e.g., mutual legal assistance treaty, letters rogatory). We carefully review each request to make sure it satisfies laws applicable to our company, laws of requesting country, international norms, and our internal policies. However, it is important to note that the laws of the Republic of Panama do not oblige us to store logs of users’ online activity. Accordingly, we do not log users’ browsing history, traffic information, or IP addresses used to access the internet via our services.  This means that we are not able to link shared IP addresses of VPN services to an individual user or otherwise individual users based on data that we do not process. Therefore, even if we were to receive a rightfully served request, it might be impossible for us to identify a specific person or provide any identifying information related to that person. In cases where, following an appropriate legal process, we are obligated to comply with a request and we are able to identify a specific person, we will provide the limited data we process as per our Privacy Policy given it falls within the scope of the request.

These locations may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal data as the one in which you reside. We assess the circumstances involving all cross-border data transfers and have suitable safeguards in place to require that your personal data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, in case your personal data is transferred to countries outside the EEA, we make sure there is an adequacy decision from the European Commission with regards to the recipient country or we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for such transfer of your personal data.</p></div> <p><p>  4.
