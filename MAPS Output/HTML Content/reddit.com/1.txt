<div><h1>  Reddit Privacy Policy</h1><p>  
      At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our users to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit, Inc. ("Reddit,” "we” or "us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.
    </p></div> <p><p>  
      We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you by default. If you want to just browse, you don't need an account. If you want to create an account to participate in a subreddit, we don't require you to give us your real name. We don't automatically track your precise location. You can share as much or as little about yourself as you want. You can create multiple accounts, update information as you see fit, or ask us to delete your information.
    </p></p> <p><p>  
      Any data we collect is used primarily to provide our services, which are focused on allowing people to come together and form communities, the vast majority of which are public. If you have questions about how we use your data, you can always ask us for more information.
    </p></p> <div><h2>  What Information We Collect</h2><td>  
<u> Information You Provide to Us </u>We collect information you
                      provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:
                    </td><td>  
<em> Account information </em>
</td><td>  
You don't need an account to use Reddit. If you create a Reddit account, your account will have a username, which you provide or which was automatically generated. Your username is public, and it doesn't have to be related to your real name. You may need to provide a password, depending on whether you register using an email address, using a Single Sign-On (SSO) feature (such as Apple or Google), or phone number. If your account does not have a password, we may send you an email or SMS for verification purposes.
                      When you use Reddit, you may provide other optional information. We may ask you to select interests (e.g. history, nature, sports) to help create a home feed for you or to select communities (e.g. r/technology) to join. You may also provide other information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, or profile picture. This information is optional and may be removed at any time. We also store your user account preferences and settings. We may ask for such information prior to you creating a username or account to help improve your experience exploring Reddit.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Content you submit </em>
</td><td>  
We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, audio and videos you broadcast, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, audio, and videos.
                      
</td><td>  
<em> Actions you take </em>
</td><td>  
We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Transactional information </em>
</td><td>  
If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Premium or Reddit Coins), we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, phone number, and information about the product or service you are purchasing. Reddit may collect public blockchain addresses, such as when you purchase an NFT or when a Reddit Vault is created. Reddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (for example, Stripe) to handle payment information and does not store Reddit Vault private key information.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Other information </em>
</td><td>  
You may choose to provide other information to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored programs, activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.
                      
</td><td>  
<u> Information We Collect Automatically </u>
When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:
                    </td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Log and usage data </em>
</td><td>  
We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, mobile carrier name, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.
                      
</td><td>  
<em> Information collected from cookies and similar technologies </em>
</td></div> <td><td>  
We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to deliver and maintain our services and our site, improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertising, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. See our <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookies" target="_blank"> Cookie Notice </a> for more information about how Reddit uses cookies. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see "Your Choices” below.
                      
</td></td> <div><p>  
<em> Location information </em>

</p><td>  
We may receive and process information about your location. We may receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive an approximate location based on your IP address.
                      

</td><td>  
<u> Information Collected from Other Sources </u>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with data you have provided to Reddit, using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by visiting the Safety & Privacy section of the User Settings menu in your account, as described in the section titled "Your Rights and Choices” below.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Linked services </em>
</td><td>  
If you authorize or link a third-party service (e.g., an unofficial mobile app client) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. For example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see "How Information About You Is Shared” below.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Information collected from integrations </em>
</td><td>  
We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a site that uses <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/embeds-terms" target="_blank"> Reddit embeds </a>, we may receive information about the web page you visited. Similarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit's ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser's site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in "Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics” below.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  <u> Information Collected by Third Parties </u></td><td>  
<em> Embedded content </em>
</td><td>  
Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Reddit services via "embeds.” For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or Twitter may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don't have to leave Reddit to see it. In general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds. As a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.
                      
</td></div> <div><td>  
<em> Audience measurement </em>
</td><td>  
We partner with service providers that perform audience measurement to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit. To provide this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to recognize your device.
                      

</td><td>  
<u> Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers </u>
If you use Reddit Ads (Reddit's self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com) we collect some additional information. To sign up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information about your company. If you purchase advertising services, you will need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also require additional documentation to verify your identity. When using Reddit Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.
                      
</td></div> <div><h3>  How We Use Information</h3><p>  We use information about you to:</p><ul>  <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li><li>Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings.</li><li>Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement" target="_blank"> Reddit User Agreement </a> and our other policies;</li><li>Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services; </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Research and develop new services;</li><li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;</li><li>Provide customer service;</li><li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see "Your Choices” below); and</li><li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  How We Share Information</h3><p>  
        Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.
      </p><p>  
        When you submit content (including a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other sites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator's option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.
      </p></div> <p><p>  
        Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public. Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, awards received, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Premium status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. You can also choose for your profile to include the content you upvote and downvote.
      </p></p> <p><p>  
        We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/privacy" target="_blank"> Tumblr </a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank"> Facebook </a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy" target="_blank"> Twitter </a>).
        
</p></p> <p><p>  
        We do not sell your personal information. However, in addition to the personal information that is displayed publicly as described above, we may share personal information in the following ways: .
      </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
<em> With your consent. </em> We may share information about you with your consent or at
          your direction.
        </li><li>
<em> With linked services. </em> If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in "Your Rights and Choices" below.
        </li><li>
<em> With our service providers. </em> We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us. Their use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. A few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services.
        </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<em> To comply with the law. </em> We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2020-1" target="_blank"> Transparency Report </a> has additional information about how we respond to government requests.
        </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
<em> In an emergency. </em> We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
        </li><li>
<em> To enforce our policies and rights. </em> We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our
          <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement" target="_blank"> User Agreement </a>,
          <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy" target="_blank"> rules </a>, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.

<em> With our affiliates. </em> We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.
        </li><li>
<em> Aggregated or de-identified information. </em> We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.
          
</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  How We Protect Your Information</h3><p>  
        We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.

When you make a request, we will verify your identity by asking you to sign into your account or if necessary by requesting additional information from you. You may also make a rights request using an authorized agent. If you submit a rights request from an authorized agent who does not provide a valid power of attorney, we may ask the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed permission to submit the request to exercise rights on your behalf. In the absence of a valid power of attorney, we may also require you to verify your own identity directly with us or confirm to us that you otherwise provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. If you have any questions or concerns, you may reach us using the methods described under Your Rights and Choices or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:redditdatarequests@reddit.com" target="_blank"> redditdatarequests@reddit.com </a>.
