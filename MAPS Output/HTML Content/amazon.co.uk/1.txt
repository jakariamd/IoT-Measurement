                        protect the security of our customers, ourselves, or others, and when we provide you
                        with interest-based advertising.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li> <strong> Your consent </strong> when we ask for your consent to process your personal information for a specific

                        we will stop processing of your data for that purpose.</li><li><strong> Compliance with a legal obligation </strong> when we use your personal information to comply with laws. For instance, we collect
