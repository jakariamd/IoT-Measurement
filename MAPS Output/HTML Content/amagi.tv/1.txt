This Services Privacy Policy describes how information is collected and utilized by Amagi related to the data it collects and uses in connection with its platform and services related to channel preparation, content distribution and advertising (the “Services”). If you are interested in our website and corporate privacy policy, please click <a href="/website-privacy-policy/" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  The Services may be used by Amagi’s customers (e.g. digital publishers, television broadcasters, OTT platforms, video producers, streaming video player providers, etc. (collectively, “Customers”)) in combination with the products and services of third parties. Amagi does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of Customers or such third parties (other than service providers we engage to perform services for us), and this Services Privacy Policy does not cover collection or use of information by Customers or such third parties. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective Customers or third parties in order to understand their privacy practices and your choices related to the same.</p></p> <div><p>  Content Guide:</p><p>  Service Data Collected</p><p>  A Customer’s end user whose data is received by Amagi as part of the Services is referred to herein as an “End User”. You are an End User if, for example, a Customer uses our Services and you view such Customer’s channel or use such Customer’s streaming player on a Viewing Platform, thus resulting in data collection by Amagi. “Viewing Platform” means any medium through which channels or VOD (video on demand) content can be viewed, such as a connected TV, smartphone, tablet, desktop computer, etc.</p></div> <p><p>  When an End User views or interacts with video content, video advertising or streaming video players through a Customer that uses the Services, Amagi collects data about this interaction, such as (if and to the extent made available by the Customer): IP address, device identifier or advertising identifier, user agent, app ID, date and time of interaction, viewing duration, country in which the End User is located, device type, operating system, content and advertising viewed (which may include program, channel and genre as well as audience group and target demographic for the content type), type of engagement with content and advertising, and other pseudonymous information made available by the End User’s device or browser (collectively, “Service Data”). Service Data does not include, and the Services do not collect, use, or allow, data that directly identifies an individual, such as name, address, phone number, email address, or government identifier.</p></p> <p><p>  Service Data is collected by Amagi through beacons inserted into the End User’s video stream or through CDN (content distribution network) logs.</p></p> <div><p>  How Service Data Is Used</p><p>  Service Data is used to provide, improve and administer our Services. For instance, we may use it to prepare and distribute a channel and its content, work with an Ad Server and/or Ad Partner to display Ads selected by the applicable Ad Server or Ad Partner, maintain and improve the performance of our Services, provide reporting to the Customers, conduct internal analysis and/or fraud detection, and perform billing, invoicing and payment functions in connection with the Customer’s use of the Services. We may also use Service Data to provide it to Ad Servers and/or Ad Partners in connection with their customization and/or optimization of the content and/or Ads displayed to an End User (for instance, Ad Servers and/or Ad Partners may use Service Data to schedule Ads, limit the number of times an Ad is shown to an End User over a given period of time, optimize the display of Ads, and/or target content or Ads to an End User’s interests or preferences).</p></div> <div><p>  How Service Data is Shared</p><p>  We may share Service Data with third parties:</p><ul>  <li>To enable our third-party service providers to perform services for us (for instance, in cases where we use cloud storage, authentication or security services provided by third parties).</li><li>With Ad Servers and Ad Partners in order to enable them to perform their respective services for our Customers, or (in cases where we have engaged such parties directly) for us.</li><li>If we believe we are required by law to do so, or if we believe that the disclosure is required or necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a court order, subpoena or other legal processes.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>If we believe that it is required by law enforcement in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or a potential threat to our Services or to a third-party.</li><li>If the information is required by our legal, financial, and other professional advisors;</li><li>With any affiliate, parent or subsidiary company of ours, with an entity who acquires us, or with a successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business was sold we may give our data files as part of that transaction.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Amagi may share aggregate and anonymous usage statistics regarding the Services with the public or businesses with whom Amagi works. Amagi may also use such aggregated information to help Amagi improve the design and delivery of its Services and increase its effectiveness for all users.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  Your Choices</p><p>  Some of the Customers, Ad Partners and Ad Servers we work with offer an opt-out from their interest-based advertising activities, as described below. You may also contact us to exercise your EU or California privacy rights as per the corresponding sections below.</p><p>   Opt-out for Desktop or Mobile Web:</p><p>  To opt-out of interest-based advertising from those of our Customers, Ad Partners and Ad Servers who provide such opt-out on desktop or mobile web, please visit the NAI page located <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank"> here </a> or the DAA page located <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank"> here </a>. In order to comply with an opt-out request, these companies may set a non-unique cookie for the sole purpose of complying with such opt-out request. If an End User deletes its cookies or changes computers or devices after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by clicking the links in this paragraph. Please note that where an End User blocks cookies on his or her browser, such companies will be unable to set an opt-out cookie, and therefore will be unable to abide by such End User opt-out request.</p></div> <div><p>   Opt-out for Mobile Applications:</p><p>  To opt-out of interest-based advertising from those of our Customers, Ad Partners and Ad Servers who provide such opt-out for the mobile applications on your mobile device, the method of opting out depends on the type of device you have. Please visit the NAI’s Mobile Choices Page located at <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices" target="_blank"> https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices# </a> for detailed instructions on how to use the advertising choice mechanisms for various devices and/or download the <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank"> DAA's AppChoices App </a> or the <a href="https://trustarc.com/privacy-app/" target="_blank"> TrustArc Privacy App </a>.</p></div> <div><p>   Opt-out for CTV</p><p>  Many of the Customers we work with, and many of the manufacturers of the TV-enabled devices that you use, may enable an opt-out of interest-based advertising for CTV (i.e., a television with third-party connected applications, a smart television and/or a digital media streaming device). Please visit the NAI’s Internet Connected TV Opt-Out Instructions Page located at <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/" target="_blank"> https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/ </a> for detailed instructions on how to use the advertising choice mechanisms for various types of CTVs.</p></div> <div><p>   Additional Information</p><p>  We may also receive certain opt-out flags from our Customers where they participate in an applicable industry framework, such as the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework or the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework.</p><p>  When we receive an opt-out flag from a CTV or otherwise from a Customer (for instance, as related to an applicable industry framework), Amagi’s system passes such flag to the Ad Servers and Ad Partners with whom it works. Amagi will still provide its Services to such Customers related to the delivery of content and/or Ads to the End User. Please note, however, that Ads may be less relevant to such End User’s interests.</p></div> <div><p>  Data Retention</p><p>  Service Data is retained in non-aggregated form for up to 12 months. Service Data may be anonymized and used for reporting and analysis, and may be stored as long as necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need or as required by law.</p><p>  Data and Information Security</p><p>  Amagi has put in place appropriate and reasonable controls designed to help safeguard the Service Data collected pursuant to this Service Privacy Policy. However, no security measures are perfect, and we cannot assure you that Service Data will never be accessed or used in an unauthorized way.</p></div> <div><p>  Storage of Information</p><p>  The information that we collect from you and about you may be transferred to and stored in a country other than your country of residence, such as the USA and the UK, which may not offer the same level of protection of personal information as your country of residence. However, we will take contractual and/or other measures when and as required by GDPR Chapter V, designed to ensure your Personal Data is protected; this also includes Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.</p></div> <div><p>  Children’s Privacy</p><p>  Amagi does not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 16. If you become aware that Amagi has collected personal information (as defined under applicable data protection laws) from a child under the age of 16, please contact Amagi at <a href="mailto:privacy@amagi.com" target="_blank"> privacy@amagi.com </a>, so that Amagi can confirm and take appropriate steps to delete the information.</p><p>  EU Privacy Rights</p><p>  Individuals located in certain countries, including the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom, have certain statutory rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in relation to their personal data.</p></div> <p><p>  To the extent that data we collect is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this <a href="/service-privacy-policy/" target="_blank"> Services </a> Privacy Policy as "Personal Data".</p></p> <div><p>   Legal Bases For Use Of Your Personal Data</p><p>  The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.
