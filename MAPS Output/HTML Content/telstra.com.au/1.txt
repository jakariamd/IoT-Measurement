            We need your personal information to provide our products and services to you
        </h3><p>  We collect different types of personal information about you. The types of personal information we collect depend on which of our products and services you use, how you use them, and our relationship with you. </p><p>  Sometimes, we may also need to collect personal information about other people from you.  Where this is the case, we rely on you to let those people know you are providing us with their information. We also rely on you to let them know about this Statement. <a href="#privacy-full" target="_blank"> Find out what types of information we collect </a>.</p></div> <div><h4>  We collect your personal information in three main ways</h4><p>  We collect your personal information when you or your authorised representative give it to us. For example, this could be in a web form or during a chat session, when you use our networks, products and services, or when we get information about you from other places, including regulators, our related entities, service providers or public posts to social networking sites. <a href="#privacy-full" target="_blank"> Learn more about how we collect your personal information </a>. </p></div> <div><h4>  We use your personal information in a variety of ways</h4><p>  We mainly use your personal information to provide products and services to you.

            How we look after your personal information, including when we share it
        </h3></div> <div><h4>  We work hard to keep your personal information secure</h4><p>  We use a combination of technical solutions, security controls and internal processes to help us protect your personal information from unauthorised access and disclosure. We're constantly updating our security measures. <a href="#privacy-full" target="_blank"> Learn more about everything we do to keep your information safe </a>.</p></div> <div><h4>  We may share your personal information with others who help us provide our services to you</h4><p>  We may share your personal information with other parties who play an important role in helping us run our business and provide products and services to you.

This may include financial institutions, credit reporting bodies, and our corporate partners. In some cases, we share your information with organisations that may be based outside Australia.  We take steps to ensure that they meet the same privacy requirements we place on ourselves. <a href="#privacy-full" target="_blank"> Learn more about how we share your personal information </a></p></div> <div><h3>  
            You're in control of your personal information
        </h3></div> <div><h4>  You can access, view and correct your personal information</h4><p>  You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you, and the right to correct it if you need to. It’s always a good idea to keep your personal information up to date. <a href="#privacy-full" target="_blank"> Learn more about your right to access and correct your personal information </a>.</p></div> <div><h4>  You can make a complaint to us or a regulator about any privacy concerns</h4><p>  Our contact details are available for you to notify us of any privacy complaints you have against us. While we hope we’ll always be able to resolve any issues you have, you can also lodge a complaint with the relevant regulator, for example the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). <a href="#privacy-full" target="_blank"> Find out more about lodging a complaint and how you can contact us </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  Our full Privacy Statement explains how we collect, store, use and share your personal information. Select a topic to find out more.</p></p> <p><p>  We collect different kinds of personal information about you. It’s information we need in order to provide our products and services to you. The types of information we collect depends on which products and services you use, how you use them, and our relationship with you.</p></p> <div><p>  Below are the main types of personal information we may collect: </p></div> <div><h4>  Identity information</h4><p>  This is information we need to make sure you are who you say you are. Verifying your identity allows us to provide you with our products and services, and also communicate with you about the products and services you use.</p><p>  This information often includes your name, date of birth, contact details, proof of identity documents, property information (for example, rental lease and utility statements), Telstra PIN, payment information and whether you are a customer of one of our trusted partners. </p></div> <div><h4>  Financial information</h4><p>  We may collect your employment, financial and credit information, like your employment and income details, payment history, credit history and service history.</p><p>  For more details on how we manage your credit information, check out our Credit Reporting Policy. You can find it on our website at telstra.com.au/privacy/important-information-about-credit.</p></div> <div><h4>  Sensitive personal information</h4><p>  We will only collect your sensitive information if it’s relevant to the products or services we provide you. In Australia, sensitive information is specifically defined in the Privacy Act, and covers things like biometric, ethnic origin and health information. For example, we may need to collect:</p><ul>  <li>Limited health information, for example to work out if you’re eligible to be a Priority Assistance telecommunications customer, or if you’re an energy customer on life support.</li><li>Biometric information like your voice patterns, for example to verify your identity or detect fraud.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We'll always ask for your consent before we collect and use your sensitive information. The only exceptions are when we’re permitted to collect and use that information, or when we're legally required to do so.</p></p> <div><h4>  Concession details</h4><p>  If you're a concession customer, we may collect information about the concessions you’re entitled to. For example, if you’re claiming a pensioner discount we’ll need your Centrelink Customer Reference Number (CRN).</p></div> <div><h4>  Information to protect against fraud, crime or misconduct</h4><p>  This includes different kinds of information we collect to protect either you or a third party, such as the time and date of a transaction made with a bank, retailer or other trusted partner. We sometimes need to compare this against Telstra service or account activity when we’re identifying and helping prevent identity theft, unauthorised transactions, or other fraudulent activities.</p></div> <div><h4>  On-site information</h4><p>  This is information we collect when you visit a Telstra store or premises. For example, via CCTV or as a written report. This sort of information helps us protect our staff and customers, and is important for preventing fraud, crime and misconduct.</p></div> <div><h4>  Your activity on our website, systems and applications</h4><p>  This includes information collected via cookies and other technologies as well as information collected during network fault finding and diagnostic testing activities.</p></div> <div><h4>  Other information we may collect</h4><p>  Depending on the Telstra products and services you use, we may also collect:</p></div> <div><h5>  Telecommunications & associated products and services </h5><ul>  <li>Information about products and services you have with us. This includes technical information about your devices such as:</li><li>Your hardware model</li><li>Operating system version</li><li>The serial number of your devices</li><li>The settings on your devices</li><li>Our network performance</li><li>How you use our networks.
</li><li>Information about how you use our products and services. This includes:</li><li>Your network usage, for example the volume, time and duration of calls and SMS messages, along with information about the operation of the equipment, services and applications you use on our networks</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>How you use our services to access the internet, for example websites you visit</li><li>Your location, or the location of your devices, when you’re using our products and services</li><li>Usage logs, communications content and call recordings that identify users only if enabled or requested as part of a product or service, for example Telstra’s security monitoring and voice solutions, or if allowed by law.
</li></ul></ul> <div><h5>  Energy products and services </h5><ul>  <li>Information about your energy usage</li><li>Information relating to your energy meter and property. This includes things like:</li><li>Your national metering identifier (NMI) which helps us identify your meter</li><li>Information about the location of your meter.
</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  Providing information on behalf of others</h4><p>  Sometimes you may need to provide personal and/or sensitive information about other individuals to us, for example your authorised representatives, or when someone at your property requires life support equipment or Priority Assist. In those cases, it’s your responsibility to tell those individuals you’re giving us their personal information and also to tell them about this Privacy Statement. We rely on you to do this.</p></div> <div><h4>  Stay privacy smart whenever you're online</h4><p>  It's important to note that our products, services and website often contain links to other websites or platforms operated by third parties. These third parties do not need to comply with our Privacy Statement. </p><p>  We recommend checking the privacy statement of the site or platform you're dealing with to understand how they'll handle your personal information. Their privacy practices and privacy policies may be very different to ours. 
</p></div> <div><p>  There are three main ways we collect your personal information:</p></div> <div><h4>  You give it to us</h4><p>  This might happen during any interaction you have with us or one of our trusted partners and includes anyone acting on your behalf. It covers a wide range of activities where you might give us information about yourself, for example when you set up an account, fill out a form on our website, chat with us online or over the phone, use one of our products or services, or contact us with a question or complaint.</p></div> <div><h4>  We collect it ourselves</h4><p>  This is information we collect about you when you interact with us, our network, product or services in some way. We might do this when you visit our website (including via cookies and other technologies) or use our products and services, including communicating with our call centres and participating in Telstra loyalty programs. We may also collect information about you when you visit a Telstra store or premises. </p></div> <div><h4>  We get it from other sources</h4><p>  These may include organisations like regulators, or sources like marketing mailing lists or commercially available information sources that contain personal, identity, geographic or demographic information. It may include information that's publicly available, like public posts on social networking sites you've used to interact with us. We may also collect information about you from our related entities, business and commercial partners, along with our service providers, for example identity and fraud checking services we use.</p></div> <p><p>  Depending on which of our products and services you use, we may also collect your personal information from other participants in the telecommunications and energy sectors. In the telecommunications sector, this might include organisations such as our wholesale customers and other organisations we deal with. In the energy sector, it could be energy distributors, other retailers and metering service providers.</p></p> <div><h4>  Don't want to share your information? We get it</h4><p>  Personal information is about you, and in some situations, you might not want to provide us with particular details. If that's the case, keep in mind that we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you need.
</p><p>  We use your personal information in a variety of ways:</p></div> <div><h4>  To provide products and services to you</h4><p>  We may use your personal information to provide products and services to you and conduct our business.  </p></div> <div><h4>  Administration</h4><p>  This includes many of the ordinary activities necessary to run our business. We may use your personal information to help us manage the products and services we provide to you, deal with enquiries and complaints and to maintain and update our records. </p><p>  For example, if you contact us with a question about your account, we’ll need to verify your identity first to protect against fraud and will use your personal information to do that.</p><p>  We also use your information for charging and billing and to identify breaches of our terms and conditions of service.</p></div> <div><h4>  Network and security monitoring</h4><p>  We undertake a range of network and security monitoring activities, including identifying and blocking content we know is malicious. For example, SMS and messages to your Telstra email we identify as scam or associated with cybercrime. We also monitor our Domain Name Servers (DNS) for known malicious domains which can lead to the downloading of malicious software onto devices. </p><p>  Where Telstra’s DNS services are used to connect to known malicious domains, we may use your personal information to determine whether you might be impacted. If so, we may take action to block malicious activity and/or notify you so that you can take action to protect yourself.</p></div> <div><h4>  Identifying fraud, crime and misconduct</h4><p>  We may use your personal information to identify and help prevent identity theft, unauthorised transactions or other fraudulent activities. These activities may happen either on or off our networks, for example fraudulent transactions with banks, retailers and other trusted partners. Personal information captured within our stores or premises, including via CCTV, may also be used to manage fraud, crime, and misconduct.</p></div> <div><h4>  Communicating with you</h4><p>  Businesses need to be able to communicate with their customers, and we’re no different. We may use phone, email, SMS, chat functions and social media to communicate with you. We may also provide you with personalised experiences within search engines and web pages you visit.</p></div> <div><h4>  Improvement, development and analysis</h4><p>  We are continually working to maintain and improve our products, services and processes and to develop new ones, and we may use your personal information to help us do this. For example, when we’re analysing network use, quality, and performance, and when we are operating, maintaining, developing, testing and upgrading our products, systems and infrastructure. </p><p>  We also use analysis to obtain high level insights into things like usage and location patterns or trends, network performance, demographic trends, and other types of behavioural data. This information is generally aggregated or de-identified when we analyse it, which means the information isn’t personal information. We may share these insights with trusted partners. </p></div> <p><p>  In some cases, we may create or share insights based on personal information, but if we do it’s always in accordance with our privacy obligations. We may also combine information we hold about you with information from one of our partners’ services to improve our credit assessment, debt recovery and other processes.</p></p> <div><h4>  Direct marketing </h4><p>  We want to make sure you hear about products, services or special offers from us (or one of our entities) that you might find useful or interesting. We may use the personal information we collect and hold about you to market and promote products, services and special offers directly to you, including as part of Telstra’s loyalty programs. </p><p>  We may also contact you with information about products, services and offers provided by our trusted partners. In some cases, this marketing activity can continue for up to 13 months after you have stopped using our products or services (including Telstra’s loyalty programs), unless you opt out. </p></div> <div><h5>  You have the right to opt out of marketing communication from us</h5><p>  If you don’t want your personal information to be used for marketing you can simply opt out. Below are the easiest ways to do it:</p><ul>  <li>You can stop Telstra (including Telstra Energy) using your personal information for direct marketing, or update your marketing preferences, by following the unsubscribe instructions in any of our marketing communications, logging into My Telstra online at my.telstra.com.au/mytelstra/home or by calling us on 1800 039 059.</li><li>You can stop Belong using your personal information for email marketing by visiting belong.com.au/unsubscribe.</li><li>Australian enterprise customers can stop Telstra Enterprise using personal information for direct marketing by following the unsubscribe instructions in any of our marketing communications, or by visiting forms.enterprisenews.telstra.com/emailunsubscribe.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Keep in mind that when you opt out of marketing messages, we will still send you important messages related to the operation of your account, for example administration or safety messages.</p></p> <div><h4>  Compliance</h4><p>  There are certain circumstances where we are required and allowed to collect or use your personal information, including those described below. Telecommunications compliance is different to energy compliance, so we’ve included a different section for each.</p></div> <div><h4>  Telecommunications & associated products and services</h4><p>  We may collect or use your personal information:</p><ul>  <li>As required or permitted by telecommunications laws and industry codes and standards legislation, including the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) (which includes data retention provisions)</li><li>To produce and distribute an alphabetical public number directory (known as the White Pages) in compliance with our Carrier Licence Conditions.

</li></ul><p>  Keeping your personal information safe is vital for our business, and information security is a priority for the products and services we offer. Our approach is based on innovation and continuous improvement, where we anticipate threats instead of simply responding to them. </p></div> <p><p>  We use a combination of advanced technical solutions, security controls and internal processes to help us protect your personal information and our network from unauthorised access and disclosure.</p></p> <div><h4>  We store your information securely</h4><p>  We may store your personal information securely in hard copy or electronic format and keep it in storage facilities that we own and operate ourselves or that are owned and operated by our service providers.</p></div> <div><h4>  We limit the amount of information we keep</h4><p>  We aim to ensure that personal information is kept as current as possible, and that irrelevant or excessive data is destroyed or de-identified as soon as reasonably possible. </p><p>  Telstra is subject to a number of legislative requirements to retain information for different periods of time. When personal information is not, or is no longer, subject to these legislative retention requirements, and no longer required for a legitimate business reason, we take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify it.
