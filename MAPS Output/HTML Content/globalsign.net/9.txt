It’s easy to navigate multiple conversations with an all-in-one, omnichannel, open platform. Reduce operational costs by automating routine, repetitive tasks. And empower agents with a unified workspace so they can quickly and easily transition from digital channels to web messaging without missing context. Give administrators the power to quickly build and customize business flow logic and integrate <a href="https://appfoundry.genesys.com/filter/genesyscloud/featured" target="_blank"> third-party applications </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Engage customers in real time with confidence</h3><p>  Never miss an online opportunity. Trigger conversations at the right moment based on business rules, such as web behavior, user segmentation and customer profile. Unlike live chat solutions, web messaging gives your agents a view of the entire customer journey and conversation history without opening multiple tabs. They can also guide customers through more complex transactions. So if a customer needs guidance along the journey, your agents can assist with the option of a real-time co-browsing session.</p></div> <div><h3>  Pause and pick up conversations</h3><p>  Make it convenient to engage with your brand by giving customers the ability to pause and resume conversations — even across devices. If a customer decides to change pages, or close the messenger window, the conversation persists. This means you can be responsive at any time, even if the contact center is closed. Make experiences richer, more intuitive and free of friction for both the agent and the customer with the ability to send and receive multiple types of media content.</p></div> <div><h3>  Secure business and customer data</h3><p>  Whether you’re an enterprise organization or a small business, handle sensitive information with confidence. Genesys uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure and support encrypted conversations, both prior and ongoing. Personally identifiable information or sensitive information is detected and hidden in real time via our co-browse masking functionality. And with authenticated web messaging, you can set it so only verified users can initiate agent sessions. Those users then can resume their web messaging conversations from any browser on any device, ensuring seamless and secure communication.</p></div> <div><h3>  See what our customers have to say</h3><p>  Within a three-week window time, we were able to move away from the old form and move into Web Messaging.

It uses asynchronous communication, meaning that customers can engage with your brand at any time, on any device. And if a customer pauses a conversation and resumes it later, the history remains for the customer and agent.</p><p>  Synchronous live chat or web chat provides short-lived, standalone chats that require an agent to interact in real-time with the customer. It has a beginning and an end for each conversation, typically with immediate responses.</p></div> <p><p>  Note: Genesys Web Messaging is the name of our native 24/7 asynchronous chat solution.</p></p> <div><h5>  What communication channels are customers using most?</h5><p>  In the past year, more consumers worldwide used a digital channel to interact with an organization than used the voice channel. In fact, some 72% of consumers used email for a CX interaction, while 68% called a contact center. <a href="https://www.genesys.com/resources/state-of-cx" target="_blank"> The State of Customer Experience, Genesys 2023 </a></p><p>  Chatbots and messaging apps also continue to increase in popularity for CX interactions. This is a landmark moment.</p></div> <p><p>  Digital is no longer on the periphery as an alternative channel to voice. It’s now critical for organizations to have a connected voice and digital strategy that empowers customers across their journey. <a href="https://www.genesys.com/resources/state-of-cx" target="_blank"> The State of Customer Experience, Genesys 2023 </a></p></p> <div><h5>  Why is native asynchronous functionality important?</h5><p>  Native asynchronous functionality enables you to have 24/7 web presence through a messaging app.</p><p>  For example, if a customer decides to change pages or close the native Genesys Messenger window, the conversation persists. Customers can engage with an agent after the contact center is closed or self-serve through a bot, search FAQs using the Messenger Knowledge Search App, or they can schedule a callback from the next-available live agent.</p></div> <div><h5>  Why do companies use live chat?</h5><p>  While companies might be looking to implement live chat software, they are actually in need of web messaging. Here’s four reasons why companies use web messaging over live chat:</p><ul>  <li><strong> 24/7 web presence </strong>
If a customer decides to change pages, or close the messenger window, the conversation persists. This means you can be responsive at any time, even if the contact center is closed.</li><li><strong> Easy to deploy and customize </strong>
With an option for no-code or low-code deployment, businesses of any size can quickly implement web messaging without relying on IT teams or expensive software development resources.</li><li><strong> Never miss an online opportunity </strong>
You can engage proactively based on the customer journey.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cost savings </strong>
You’ll reduce operational costs because you won’t need as large a support team as you would to manage real-time chats. You’ll also save through more efficient use of resources.</li></ul></ul> <div><h5>  What are the benefits of web messaging for customers?</h5><p>  Web messaging is convenient and accessible. Customers like being able to engage at their own pace and on their own schedules, without being tied to real-time conversations. And because web messaging is an “anywhere, anytime” solution, it’s ideal for 24/7 communication whenever it’s convenient for customers – and even across different devices, whether desktop or mobile web browsers.</p><p>  In addition to other live chat tools, customers can enjoy richer, personalized and actionable conversations with brands through web messaging. Give your customers a more interactive digital experience using rich messaging and free them from the drudgery of typing long messages. And because you’ll have holistic customer profiles and customer journey data, you’ll know exactly who you’re talking to and why they’re reaching out. Customers don’t have to start their interaction from scratch every time they reach out.</p></div> <div><h5>  What’s the best way to personalize web engagements?</h5><p>  Rich messaging is a great way to personalize and improve engagements.</p><p>  Instead of having to type long messages, make your customer and agent experiences richer, more intuitive and free of friction with the ability to send and receive multiple types of media content. With web messaging, they’ll be able to use quick replies, cards, carousels, emojis and file attachments.</p><p>  With holistic customer profiles and customer journey information, your agents will know exactly who they’re talking to and why. That same information can help agents know when it’s best to engage proactively.</p></div> <p><p>  By using our natively integrated Genesys Co-browse capability, agents can also gain a better understanding of customers’ needs by elevating the existing web messaging conversation to co-browse seamlessly – and still part of the original interaction. Agents will guide them through the most complex transactions – boosting the customer experience and improving conversion rates.</p></p> <div><h5>  What’s the difference between Co-Browse and Screen Sharing?</h5><p>  Screen sharing allows customers to share their entire desktop so agents can see everything happening on the customer’s screen. Co-browsing is limited to a specific browser. For example, if the customer decides to browse a different private website, the agent won’t see the new browsing session. This ensures a high level of user privacy.</p><span>  +1.888.436.3797</span><p>  Every year, Genesys® orchestrates billions of remarkable customer experiences for organizations in more than 100 countries.
