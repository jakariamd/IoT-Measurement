<b> Why it matters </b>

This industry practice provides monetary rewards and public recognition for external security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities to the Nest Security team. We want responsible security researchers to examine our products and we pay monetary rewards only after the disclosed vulnerabilities are fixed. Through this program, the Nest Security team can learn about and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.</p></div> <div><span>

              </span></div> <div><h3>  How does this make Nest devices more secure?</h3><p>  If someone outside of Google discovers a security vulnerability in one of our devices, we want to know about it. To qualify for a monetary award, the researcher must wait for Google to patch the vulnerability before disclosing it to anyone else. This program creates an incentive for security researchers around the world to help us make our devices more secure.</p></div> <div><h3>  How else does Google find security vulnerabilities?</h3><p>  We have dedicated security teams that analyze the hardware and software of each device before it’s available to the public, and we do our best to make sure our devices are secure. After the initial verification is performed, we also continue to analyze risks and security threats after devices are introduced and provide automatic, <a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/10231940" target="_blank"> critical security updates for at least 5 years </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>

For example, if there’s an attempt to sign into your account from an unrecognized device.</p></div> <div><h3>  How does 2-step verification protect my account?</h3><p>  2-step verification makes it harder for someone to sign into your account, even if they have your password. When 2-step verification is enabled, anyone signing in to your account will need to complete a second step, or “factor,” before signing in. You can choose from multiple second factors, including a text message, a code from the Google Authenticator app, or a notification from an installed Google app.</p></div> <div><h3>  I have a Nest Account and use that to sign in to the Nest app. Why should I switch to a Google Account?</h3><p>  Migrating to a Google Account gives you new benefits, like:

</p><ul>  <li>Automatic security protections such as suspicious activity detection, 2-step verification, and Security Checkup.</li><li>Your Google Nest devices and services work together. For example, if you have a Nest Cam and a Chromecast, just say, “Hey Google, show me the backyard camera” to cast your camera stream to your TV without any setup.</li><li>One account to sign into both the Nest and Google Home apps.</li><li>Your homes and home members are aligned across the Nest and Google Home apps.</li></ul></div> <div><h3>

Make sure you sign out of devices you don’t own or control, and check your Google Account for devices you don’t recognize.</p></div> <div><h3>  What happens if I see a device I don’t recognize in My Account?</h3></div> <div><h3>  Cameras</h3><p>  Cameras serve a variety of purposes in the home, such as capturing memories, connecting with loved ones, and helping you feel secure. Devices like Nest Cam use video to help you keep an eye on your home and alert you when things happen, even when you’re not there.

For all our connected home devices with cameras, we commit to you:</p><p>  Your camera sends video footage to Google only if you or someone in your home has explicitly turned the camera on or enabled a feature that needs it (such as Nest Cam monitoring). You can always turn the camera off.</p></div> <p><p>  When your camera is turned on and sending video footage to Google, we will provide a clear visual indicator (such as a green light on your device).</p></p> <p><p>  When video footage is stored with your Google Account (for example, via a subscription to Nest Aware), you can access, review, and delete this footage at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  We will only share video footage with third-party apps and services that work with our devices if you or a member of your home explicitly gives us permission.</p></p> <p><p>  Nest Hub Max offers on-device camera sensing features that help you personalize and control your experience based on what the camera sees, such as Face Match (which helps your device recognize you) and Quick Gestures (which helps you control your device). Once enabled, these on-device camera sensing features don’t send video or images from your Nest Hub Max to Google.</p></p> <div><span>

When you set up Face Match on your Nest Hub Max, you use your phone to capture several photos that are combined to create a unique model of your face. These photos are sent to Google, and you can review or delete them anytime by visiting <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity" target="_blank"> My Activity </a>. After this setup process, Face Match does not send any video or images to Google. And Quick Gestures does not require sending any video or images to Google at all. In addition, we keep the video and images that power these features separate from advertising and don’t use them for ad personalization.</p></div> <div><h3>  What’s an example of when my video footage might be shared with third-party apps and services?</h3><p>  One example of this is we may offer the option to share video clips from Nest Cam with your home security service, so they can help keep your home safe. Also, remember you can use your device’s camera with other Google services (such as uploading a video to YouTube or making a video call with Google Duo) – and when you do this, Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a> will apply.</p></div> <div><h3>  Are there times when video footage is sent to Google servers without a visual indicator?</h3><p>  Some models of our cameras support recording video footage while offline. For these cameras, video footage will be uploaded when the camera goes back online after the video footage has been recorded. That means you may not see a visual indicator when your camera is sending the video footage to our servers -- but in those instances, a visual indicator would have been visible when the camera was actually recording the video footage.</p></div> <div><h3>  Microphones</h3><p>  Microphones serve a variety of purposes in the home, such as letting you control devices throughout your home using just your voice, detecting unexpected activity in your home when you’re not there, and making a voice call using a smart speaker or display.

For all our connected home devices with microphones, we commit to you:</p><p>  Your device will only send audio to Google if we detect that you or someone in your home is interacting with your Assistant (for example, by saying “Hey Google”), or if you use a feature that needs it (for example, sound alerts on Nest Cam, or Nest Cam video recording with audio enabled). You can always turn the microphone off.</p></div> <p><p>  When your microphone is turned on and sending audio to Google, we will provide a clear visual indicator (such as flashing dots on top of your device or an on-screen indicator).</p></p> <p><p>  When audio recordings are stored with your Google Account (for example, the audio from your Nest Cam footage when you’ve subscribed to Nest Aware), you can access, review, and delete your recordings at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  We will only share audio recordings from your devices with third-party apps and services that work with our devices if you or a member of your home explicitly gives us permission.</p></p> <div><span>

In these instances, the visual indicator will be visible when the microphone is active, as opposed to when the audio data is transmitted to Google servers.</p></div> <div><h3>  Home sensors</h3><p>  Some of our devices include sensors that detect information about your home’s environment and what’s happening in it, such as motion, whether or not someone is home, ambient light, temperature, and humidity. These sensors serve a variety of purposes, such as helping your home take better care of you – like when your Nest Learning Thermostat turns itself down when you’re away – and helping us make your devices and services better.

For all our connected home devices with these environmental and activity sensors, we commit to you:</p></div> <p><p>  We’ll help you understand how the sensor readings collected from your home environment are used in our devices and services. That’s why we’ve published this <a href="https://support.google.com/googlehome/?p=sensorglossary#topic=7029677" target="_blank"> guide to sensors in our devices </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  We will only share your device sensor data with third-party apps and services that work with our devices if you or a member of your home explicitly gives us permission.</p></p> <div><span>
