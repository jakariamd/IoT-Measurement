This includes information you provide when you register on Phyn Websites, register or return a Phyn Product, subscribe to any of our services, search for a product, place an order on Phyn Websites, participate in social media functions on Phyn Websites, enter a competition, promotion or survey, participate in a training session or other event, download firmware, software and apps, or when you report a problem with Phyn Websites or Phyn Products or otherwise request support.

Once you provide this phone number, it will be stored along with your account information and will be used to send you SMS alerts regarding various functions of the service, including alerts about leaks, alerts about device connectivity and alerts about product enhancements, such as when new functionality has been unlocked for your account.  </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Profile Information: </strong> Your account may allow you to provide certain basic profile information like your name and profile photo. Names and profile photos may be shown to others in connection with the Services. For example, if you invite someone as an additional authorized user, he or she may be able to see your name and photo. You should only use photos you are willing to make public.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Information we collect about you.  </u>We automatically collect information when you use Phyn Websites or Phyn Products, including:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Data from your Phyn Product’s sensors, including but not limited to alerts, notifications, user preferences, settings, and user actions, water usage information (including current flow rate, temperature and pressure rate) other data collected by Phyn via third party systems you’ve authorized Phyn to communicate with, and direct adjustments to your Phyn Product and Phyn app, including modifications or settings. We will also collect information as you use and interact with Phyn, including your activity using the Phyn app, clicking on the various functions and features and providing feedback from alerts and water consumption data to correct the system. This data helps your Phyn Product detect leaks. Information about leaks, notifications or alerts delivered through the Phyn app, and any actions you take in response to those notifications are also collected and used to improve the system’s ability to detect leaks and quantify water use.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Technical information from the Phyn Product: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with the Phyn Product, we record your device’s model and serial number, software version, and other technical information.</li><li><strong> Wi-Fi Network Information:  </strong>To connect your Phyn Product to our app and services, or to access your Phyn Product over the Internet from a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, you will need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. During setup, Phyn will ask for your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the Phyn Product firmware, along with your IP address, so that you can access it and control it from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with Phyn’s servers and download software updates. Once connected to your Wi-Fi network, your Phyn Product regularly sends the data described in this Privacy Policy (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to Phyn to provide you with services related to your water use.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Information about your visit to Phyn Websites, including the full Uniform Resource Locators (“URL”) you clickstream to, through and from Phyn Websites (including date and time), products you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, videos watched, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <u> Information we receive from other sources </u>. We may also receive information about you from other sources, including third parties who provide services to us (including, for example, business partners, our affiliates, subcontractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies or publicly available sources) and we may receive information about you from them.</p></p> <div><p>  HOW WE USE INFORMATION</p><p>  We use the information we collect for a number of purposes. These purposes will be consistent with the reason you provided the information to us or for a directly related purpose. The uses we make of such information include the following:</p><ul>  <li>To set up an account for you on Phyn Websites or Phyn Products.</li><li>To facilitate your purchase and/or download of Phyn Products.</li><li>To authenticate use of your account or purchases and/or use of a Phyn Product.</li><li>To register your Phyn Product in our product database.</li><li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us.</li><li>To assist you with customer support.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To communicate about and administer participation in customer promotions and surveys you choose to participate in.</li><li>To provide the Phyn Products or any services you request.</li><li>To provide you with information about the Phyn Products you use, such as new features, bug fixes, service downtimes or upgrades.</li><li>To provide you from time to time with information relating to your energy or water usage and suggest potential savings in water or energy usage, including making assessments and recommendations about your plumbing, water leaks and water use.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To help us develop new Phyn Products and services and improve current Phyn Products and services.</li><li>To provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information about goods or services we feel may interest you. We (or selected third parties) will contact you by electronic means only if you have opted-in to receive marketing information. “Opt-in” means that you have taken an affirmative action to receive information, such as by checking a box or clicking a button.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To notify you about changes to Phyn Websites and Phyn Products and changes to our terms, conditions and policies.</li><li>To administer Phyn Websites and Phyn Products for internal operational purposes, including troubleshooting, data and statistical analysis, testing, research and survey purposes.</li><li>To improve Phyn Websites and Phyn Products and to ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or device.</li><li>To ensure the security of Phyn Websites and Phyn Products.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To monitor and regulate interactive features of Phyn Websites and Phyn Products that you may choose to participate in.</li><li>To help you navigate Phyn Websites.</li><li>To help you access and use certain features of Phyn Products remotely and to help you monitor and safeguard your home.</li><li>To measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others who visit Phyn Websites and to deliver relevant personalized advertising to you and others.</li><li>To determine which aspects of Phyn Websites and Phyn Products are most useful to you and other users of Phyn Websites and Phyn Products.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  Why We Use Information</p><p>  Where we process your Personal Information to provide a product or service, we do so because it is necessary to perform contractual obligations that we owe to you. If you choose not to provide us with the Personal Information we need to provide you with a product or service, we will not be able to provide the product or service to you. When you purchase and/or download new Phyn products, we will only use your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, and any notification provided to you at the time of purchase or download.</p></div> <p><p>  We also use your Personal Information to protect our business (for example, against fraud), to comply with legal requirements to which we are subject (for example, tax or financial reporting requirements) and for other legitimate interests.</p></p> <p><p>  We will send you direct marketing only if you have given your consent to such communications. See the Marketing section below.</p></p> <div><p>  SHARING INFORMATION</p><p>  Under no circumstances do we rent or sell your Personal Information. We will only share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes if you have granted us permission to do so and in accordance with the Marketing section below. We share Personal Information in the following ways:</p><ul>  <li>Within Phyn for purposes of data processing or storage.</li><li>Within Phyn’s corporate group, including with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies and divisions, all of whom may use your information for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</li><li>With Phyn’s service providers. Our service providers are not allowed to use, share or retain your personal information except as permitted by us.</li><li><strong> With other third parties with your consent.  </strong>Phyn may provide you with the ability to enable authorized users (“Authorized Users”) to access your account. Information will only be shared with Authorized Users if you give explicit consent to this sharing. If you consent, the Authorized Users may control and view all of your devices, content, and third-party connections. One example of an Authorized User would be if you invite another person to access your Phyn account as an Authorized User. An invited user must have or create a Phyn account, and information about invited users (like email address, name, or changes to product settings) will be stored with your account. Another example would be if you sign up for programs offered by our partners (such as insurance companies); if you do this, we may share certain information with the partner. This could include your enrollment information, usage data and the activation status of your device. Usage data received through Phyn sensors may be shared with Authorized Users if you authorize them to receive such data (such as your plumber, property owner/manager or insurance company). Similarly, when you connect third-party devices and services to your Phyn Products, you are shown information about any proposed exchange of data. Your explicit consent is required to allow these exchanges on your behalf and you can change your mind at any time.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>With service providers, advisors or other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets. If Phyn merges with or acquires or is acquired by another entity, Personal Information would be transferred as a whole to the successor entity.</li><li>To comply with the law or legal process (such as responding to subpoenas or court orders), to comply with government reporting obligations and to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To protect our legal rights or those of others, such as protecting the Phyn brand or investigating violations of Phyn terms of use, violations of law, intellectual property infringement, misuse of Phyn Websites, fraud or potential threats to personal safety.</li><li>To the public with your consent, such as when you participate in a survey or review.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition, we may use and share aggregated and anonymized information with third parties and service providers for a variety of purposes, including to analyze trends about water usage across all Phyn user homes, to show third parties how their products could work with Phyn Products and to help us make sales, marketing and business decisions. This aggregated and anonymized information may also be shared with other users to help them better understand their water usage compared to other Phyn users, to raise awareness about safety or conservation issues, or to help us generally improve our service. We may also share aggregated and anonymized information with our business partners, for example, if they are interested in providing demand-response services or other incentive programs. We’ve taken steps to ensure that this information cannot be linked back to you and we require third parties to keep all shared information in its anonymized form.</p></p> <p><p>  For certain Phyn Products, Phyn may provide the opportunity for you to connect and interface Phyn Products with one or more third party products and services, which will involve the exchange of information from your Phyn Product with the third-party product or service. Your explicit consent and authorization will be required at the time of connection to the third-party product or service and will be revocable by you at any time by sending us an email request at info@phyn.com. In some cases, if you purchase, use or download a third-party product or service that connects to a Phyn Product, that third party may apply its own privacy practices.  Phyn is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party partners. If you access a Phyn Product through a third-party product in this manner, you consent and agree to the privacy policy of such third party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and terms of use of any third-party products that connect to Phyn Products before providing them with your Personal Information.</p></p> <p><p>  Any service providers with whom we share your Personal Information are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. We will take all reasonable steps to make sure these service providers comply with the same privacy principles that govern our collection of your Personal Information.</p></p> <p><p>  We will ask for your consent, such as by email response, opt-in box or click through agreement acceptance, before we use or share your Personal Information for any other purpose.</p></p> <div><p>  MARKETING</p><p>  We will process your Personal Information for marketing purposes, either from ourselves or a third party, only with your consent.</p><p>  You have various choices in relation to your Personal Information. Some choices are presented up front in the form of opt-in notices or acceptance boxes for marketing to you or sharing your Personal Information with third parties. You always have the choice to opt-out if you later change your mind. One form of opt-out is clicking the Unsubscribe link in a marketing email. This will take you off our marketing email list.</p></div> <p><p>  Please note that these opt-in/opt-out choices do not apply to the receipt of mandatory website, service or software communications, such as update or downtime information, leak alerts or service integrated emails or receipt of order or shipping confirmations on Phyn Website stores, which you may receive periodically as part of Phyn performing its contract with you, unless you cancel your service or order or terminate use of software in accordance with the applicable terms of use or license agreement.</p></p> <p><p>  If you do not wish to receive direct marketing material from us or a third party, in addition to following the “Unsubscribe” instructions in a marketing email, you can send us an email request at <a href="mailto:info@phyn.com" target="_blank"> info@phyn.com </a>.</p></p> <div><p>  WHERE WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</p><p>  The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, various locations globally, including the United States. It may also be processed by Phyn staff or contractors operating outside your country of residence (including, if you are in Europe, outside of the EEA, or, if you are in Australia or New Zealand (“ANZ”), outside of ANZ) who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details or the provision of support services. We also use cloud-based applications and services to store and process your Personal Information, which may result in your Personal Information being stored outside your country of residence (or the EEA or ANZ).</p></div> <p><p>  We will take such steps as are reasonable to make sure we and our service providers do not breach the privacy principles that govern our collection of your Personal Information and that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy as well as applicable data protection laws. By providing your Personal Information to us, you fully understand that Phyn will transfer, process and store your Personal Information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different, and disclose your Personal Information to overseas service providers who may not fully comply with the particular laws of your country.</p></p> <p><p>  Our Privacy Policy and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for Personal Information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, Phyn will still handle your information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and in conformity with all applicable laws. This includes, where relevant, entering into EU standard contractual clauses (or equivalent measures) with the party outside the EEA (available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank"> here </a>).</p></p> <div><p>  UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p><p>  We need your help in keeping your Personal Information accurate and up to date, so please notify us of any changes to your Personal Information.

If you are outside the EEA or California, we may make a reasonable charge if records must be accessed from backed up or archived records. Note that California residents may be entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for direct marketing.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The right to be informed of the source of the Personal Information, if we did not obtain it from you.</li><li>The right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards implemented in relation to any transfer of your Personal Information from within to outside the EEA.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you are resident in the EEA, you also have the following rights:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time after you have consented, including opting-out of receiving marketing materials. The easiest way to do this is by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in any email you receive from us.</li><li>If we are processing your Personal Information either on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you, the right to receive such data in a machine-readable format or where feasible to have us transfer it directly to a third party data controller.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The right to restrict our processing of your Personal Information where you believe such data to be inaccurate, our processing to be unlawful, or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose (unless we are not able to restrict such processing or delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it).</li><li>The right to object to such processing on grounds relating to your particular situation, where the legal justification for our processing of your Personal Information is our legitimate interest. We will abide by your request unless we have compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests and rights, or if we need to continue to process the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You can make a request to exercise any of these rights in relation to your Personal Information by sending the request by email to <a href="mailto:info@phyn.com" target="_blank"> info@phyn.com </a> or, if you are in California, by calling us at 877-460-2323.</p></p> <p><p>  We will respond to your request promptly upon receipt. If you are in the EEA, this will be within one month of receipt, or if further time is required, we will inform you of this and the reason for the delay. We may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. We may conduct an identity verification by phone call or email. Depending on your request, we will ask for information such as your name, the email address connected to your account with us, or the date of a support call you made to us. We may also ask you to provide a signed declaration confirming your identity.</p></p> <p><p>  In some circumstances, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf. We will require verification that you provided the authorized agent permission to make a request on your behalf. You must provide us with a copy of the signed permission you have given to the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf and verify your own identity directly with us. </p></p> <p><p>  If you are an authorized agent submitting a request on behalf of an individual in California, you must attach a copy of the following information to the request:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>A completed Authorized Agent Designation Form, located <a href="https://phyn.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/Authorized-Agent-Designation-Form-Phyn.pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>, indicating that you have authorization to act on the consumer’s behalf.</li><li>If you are a business, proof that you are registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If we do not receive both pieces of information, the request will be denied.</p></p> <p><p>  If your Personal Information has been disclosed to a third party in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to notify the third party of any updated information you provide to us.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are in the EEA, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority if you believe that we have not complied with applicable data protection laws.

When we no longer need to use Personal Information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it.</p><p>  To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p></div> <p><p>  COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND OTHER WEB TOOLS</p></p> <p><p>  We use automatic data collection tools like cookies, embedded web links and widgets.
