                        accessing the Services. If we receive data from your device’s location
                        indicating that you are outside the United States, we may block your access to

                        when you are outside the United States, we will use your IP address for the
                        legitimate interest of allowing or denying access to geo-restricted content

                        platform’s privacy policy applies including with regard to any transfer and

                        may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such
                        as the European Union. By using the Team Coco website, listening to Team

                        We may do this through a variety of means, such as by blending your data with
                        data about other individuals, by hashing the data or otherwise removing
                        characteristics that make the data personally identifiable to you. Such de-identified
                        or pseudonymized data is considered non-personal to the full extent allowed by
                        applicable law. We maintain and use de-identified data without attempting to
                        re-identify it, except </p></div> <span><span>  where permitted by applicable
                        law such as to evaluate the sufficiency of our de-identification processes. We
                        may use and share non-personal data with third parties for any purpose in our
                        discretion and as permitted by law, including for advertising, research and
                        marketing purposes. However, if we combine non-personal data with personal
                        data, we will treat the combined information as personal data.</span></span> <div><h2>  3. Summary of Sirius XM Key Personal Data Practices</h2><p>  This section presents a summary of our key personal
