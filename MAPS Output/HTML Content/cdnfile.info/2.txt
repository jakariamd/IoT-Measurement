This is only available for buyers. Sellers can’t cancel the contract, as long as you do not miss any final monthly payment deadline(s). When you opt to cancel a transaction, the received installments will be kept by the seller. You won’t receive the ownership of the domain and the domain will be returned to the original seller.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Long term service fee</li></ul><p>  Long term service fee is a fee percentage added when you pick a period longer than 1 year.
