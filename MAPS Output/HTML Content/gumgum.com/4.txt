This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li><li>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.

In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li><li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.

What We May Need From You</h2><p>  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any other right).

We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p></div> <div><h2>  15. Time Limit To Respond</h2><p>  We try to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) days.  Occasionally it may take us longer to process your request if it is particularly complex or if you have made multiple requests.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated on the status of your request(s).</p></div> <div><h2>  16.
