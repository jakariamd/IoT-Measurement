GumGum is committed to providing you with meaningful information and making sure you know your rights when it comes to any information you share with us. We want you to know that we are a “Privacy Forward” company and we embrace protecting consumer privacy. Our goal is to be transparent about the data we and our partners collect and inform you about how your data is (or is not) used, so that you can exercise your right to control the use of your personal data.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> ABOUT US & OUR PRIVACY POLICY </strong></h3><p>  This Privacy Policy describes how GumGum collects, uses and shares personal information on its website and, if applicable, mobile devices. When we say “GumGum,” “we,” or “us” in this Privacy Policy, we mean the GumGum entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the “Identifying the Data Controller and Processor” section below. This Privacy Policy is also relevant for any European Economic Area (“EEA”) or California resident sharing his/her personal data directly or indirectly with GumGum and is provided in a layered format so you can click through to the specific areas set out below. Please also refer to the Glossary to understand the meaning of some of the terms used in this Privacy Policy.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> DID YOU RECEIVE AN AD FROM US? </strong></h3><p>  First, you’ll be happy to know that GumGum doesn’t know who you are! We don’t know your name, the names of your family or friends, yours or their phone number, home address, exact location - nothing! So, then you may be wondering how is it that you keep receiving ads that seem to be “targeting” you? Well, let us explain. GumGum serves advertisements contextually – meaning, we only use images and text to serve ads relevant to you based on your browsing habits. We have no idea who you are, only that you enjoy shopping for sneakers!How do we do it? Well, everyone has heard of cookies. No; not the chocolate chip or peanut butter variety but the small text files sent by us to your computer or mobile device that enables GumGum features and functionalities that are unique to your account or your browser. To find out more about cookies, visit <strong> this site </strong>.For advertising, cookies help GumGum to:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Understand your online behaviors as you go from one site to another so that we can show you more relevant ads (and not a bunch of ads that you don’t have any interest in);</li><li>Know if you have interacted with or viewed a particular ad; and/or</li><li>Synchronize audience data between advertising buyers and sellers. Basically, the cookies allow buyers and sellers to communicate about what you like. So, if you’ve frequented sneaker sites, a sneaker company can build a profile about you based on your computer or mobile device’s behavior. GumGum then uses the cookie to say to the buyer, “Hey buyer, this device is browsing a site and probably likes sneakers, do you want to buy that ad space for a sneaker ad?” The buyer will, in turn, either buy the space to serve you a sneaker ad or not. This process is called syncing and helps ads get served to you so that you can hopefully get a deal for those awesome sneakers!</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  As you see, we do not in any way collect any of your personal data or information. We really don’t want it. We just want to keep serving ads to you based on things you’re already shopping for!</p></p> <div><h3>  <strong> TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT </strong></h3><p>  Did we mention we are transparent?

If we are required by law to tell you about any unauthorized access of your personal information, we may notify you in writing or by telephone.

Some of our external third parties are global and based outside of the EEA so their processing of your personal information may involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.Whenever we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we make sure a similar degree of protection is afforded to you by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission that give personal information the same protection it has in Europe.</li><li>Where we use providers based in the U.S., we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the U.S. or pursuant to the affirmation of participation under the EU Model Clauses.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  ‍<strong> EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (EEA) RESIDENTS: YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS </strong></h3><p>  If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to access, rectify, download, or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances. We describe these rights below:</p></div> <div><h4>  <strong> Access </strong></h4><p>  You can access your personal data by submitting a data subject access request. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You may also request to correct any incomplete or inaccurate personal data that we hold about you. However, we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p></div> <div><h4>  ‍<strong> Rectify/Restrict/Limit/Remove </strong></h4><p>  You have the right to ask us to rectify, restrict, limit, or remove the processing of your personal data where (1) there is no good reason for us to continue processing it, (2) we may have processed information inaccurately, unlawfully or (3) we were required to erase for compliance with local law. Note that we may not always be able to comply with your request to erase for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you at the time of your request.</p></div> <p><p>  You may also request the transfer of your personal data to a third party, in which we will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. This right only applies to automated information that you previously consented for us to use and/or used to perform a contract with you.</p></p> <div><h4>  ‍<strong> Object/Withdraw </strong></h4><p>  You may object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances when relying on a legitimate interest of yours or of a third party that you feel impedes on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which overrides your rights and freedoms.You may also withdraw consent to processing your personal data at any time. This does affect the lawfulness of any processing we have done prior to your consent withdrawal, and we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you after your consent withdrawal. We will notify you if this is the case at the time of your consent withdrawal.If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at <strong> dataprivacy@gumgum.com </strong>.</p></div> <div><h4>  ‍<strong> No Charge/Fees (in most cases </strong></h4><p>  You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p></div> <div><h4>  ‍<strong> What We May Need from You </strong></h4><p>  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any other right). This is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p></div> <div><h4>  ‍<strong> Time Limit to Respond </strong></h4><p>  We try to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty (30) days. Occasionally, however, it may take us longer to process your request if it is particularly complex and/or if you have made multiple requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated on the status of your request(s).</p></div> <div><h4>  ‍<strong> Your Right to File a Complaint </strong></h4><p>  If you are based in the European Union, you also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)—the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues <strong> ICO UK </strong>.
