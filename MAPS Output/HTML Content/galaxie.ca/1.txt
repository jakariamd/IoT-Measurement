Currently, no universally accepted standard exists for how to interpret such signals, although work to create consensus is ongoing. Accordingly, and because Stingray does not track its users over time and across third-party websites, Stingray does not respond to such DNT signals.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> WHERE IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED AND TRANSFERRED? </strong></h3><p>  Your Personal Information may be held by Stingray in locations other than your province, territory, state, or country of residence, including in Canada (including in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario), the United States and/or the United Kingdom.
