These may be offered by, or on behalf of, the NBA Family, or by our partners and other third parties with whom we have a relationship. The promotional messages and advertisements that you see may be determined by data that we collect or receive about you, such as your demographic data, location data, usage data, interests and preferences.  We refer to this as “interest-based advertising”.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To conduct internal and market research, identify usage trends, and determine the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Security, compliance and enforcement. </strong>  We use the data we collect for security, legal, regulatory, compliance and enforcement purposes.  Specifically:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To protect the safety and security of our fans and our Services.</li><li>To detect and prevent abuse, fraud or other unlawful or unauthorized activities.</li><li>To resolve disputes.</li><li>To comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</li><li>To enforce our agreements, including our policies and terms of service that govern your use of the Services.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We may also use your data in any other manner as disclosed at the time of collection, or when we have otherwise obtained consent.  Please also note that this Policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with aggregated, pseudonymized or anonymized data. We may also merge, co-mingle, or otherwise combine data about you, including personal information, in furtherance of the uses above.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> How We Share and Disclose Data </strong></li></ul><p>  There are times when the data we collect may be shared by the NBA Family.  We share your data for the following purposes:</p><p>  <strong> Providing the Services. </strong>  We sometimes engage or partner with other companies to operate the Services or perform certain functions on our behalf – for example, maintaining and enhancing our fan databases, delivering messages and advertising, operating our websites and digital platforms.  We may provide these companies with access to your data as needed for them to perform these functions in a manner consistent with this Policy.  For more information about who these companies are, and how they use your data, please see the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/privacy_policy.html#Third_Party_Sections" target="_blank"> Third Party Sites and Sections </a>” section of this Policy below.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> With Partners and Third Parties.  </strong>We may share your information with certain business partners so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional and other materials that may be of interest to you. We share personal data with partners and third parties as part of marketing and advertising on and off of the Services. We may use third-parties to serve advertisements on the Services. These third parties may set their own cookies or similar web technologies to collect information about users’ online activities over time and across websites. For more information about how these third parties use your data and how you can manage these technologies, please see the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/privacy_policy.html#Cookies" target="_blank"> Cookies and Similar Technologies </a>” section of this Policy below.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Among the NBA Family. </strong>  We share personal data among the companies within the NBA Family to provide and improve the Services, to build predictive models to better understand our fans, to send promotional messages and advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you, and for other purposes consistent with this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> As part of a change in business structure. </strong>  In the event of a sale, merger, acquisition, reorganization or similar event, or in contemplation of such an event (e.g., due diligence), your data may be among the transferred assets.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> When necessary under certain circumstances. </strong>  We may disclose your personal data when we believe that disclosure is necessary to:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process.</li><li>Protect the safety and security of our fans or our Services.</li><li>Prevent fraud, abuse or other unlawful or unauthorized activities.</li><li>Protect the rights or property of us or third parties, including enforcing the terms of our agreements.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We may also share your data for any other purpose as disclosed at the time of collection, or when we have otherwise obtained consent.  Please note that this Policy is not intended to limit our ability to share or disclose aggregated, pseudonymized or anonymized data.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> What Choices You Have </strong></li></ul><p>  You have many choices about how we collect, use and share your data.</p><p>  <strong> Communications choices. </strong>  You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional messages from the NBA Family and which types of messages you wish to receive.  If you receive promotional messages from us and would like to opt out, you may do so by following instructions within those messages.  You may also adjust your communications preferences by <a href="https://www.nba.com/account/nbaprofile" target="_blank"> logging into your NBA account </a> and viewing your preferences.  Please note that these preferences do not apply to informational or transactional communications regarding the Services or other communications that have their own unsubscribe method.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Advertising choices. </strong>  You can opt out of interest-based advertising as described in this section and in the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/privacy_policy.html#Cookies" target="_blank"> Cookies and Similar Technologies </a>” section of this Policy.  When you opt out, your selection is stored on a cookie on your device.  If you delete the cookie from that device or sign in from a different device, you will need to opt out again.</p></p> <p><p>  Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other necessary purposes (including providing the Services and for authentication and security purposes), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop the data from being collected nor reduce the number of advertisements you will see.  However, the data will not be used for interest-based advertising, which means the advertisements you do see may be less relevant to you.</p></p> <p><p>  When using a mobile application, you may receive interest-based in-application advertisements.  Depending on your device, you may be able to reset your mobile device’s advertising identifier at any time by accessing the privacy settings on your device.  In addition, each operating system (e.g., iOS for Apple devices, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of interest-based in-application advertisements.  You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating system in order to opt-out of interest-based in-application advertisements.  For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact (or review the applicable privacy web page of) the applicable platform operator.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Other choices. </strong>  You also have choices about the data you provide directly to us when you register for or use the Services.  Please note, however, that if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide certain features of the Services, your use of the Services may not include those features.</p></p> <p><p>  You can access, edit or remove information in your user account by visiting <a href="https://secure.nba.com/membership/user/login/" target="_blank"> https://www.nba.com/account/nbaprofile </a>.  If you cannot access your account, or if you would like to request that we delete other personal data referenced in this Policy, you may visit us at <a href="http://privacy.nba.com/" target="_blank"> http://privacy.nba.com </a> or contact us using any of the methods described in the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/privacy_policy.html#Contact_Us" target="_blank"> How to Contact Us </a>” section of this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose not to share certain location data by adjusting the settings on your device.  Please note, however, that if you choose not to share this data, you may not be able to access or use location-based Services.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose to limit the data that third party services (e.g., social media platforms) share with us using the options provided to you by the applicable third party service (for example, the options provided by a third party social media platform when you connect your social media account with the Services).  You can also disconnect your use of the Services from the third party service at any time using the options provided to you by the applicable third party service.  Please note, however, that if you disconnect from the third party service, that will not delete the data we may have previously collected while you were connected.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Cookies and Similar Technologies </strong></li></ul><p>  We use cookies and similar technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to provide the Services and to collect data.  In addition, third parties may also use Tracking Technologies when you use the Services; for example, if we engaged a third party to operate the Services, or because the Services contain content or advertisements delivered by third parties.  These Tracking Technologies consist of:</p><ul>  <li>Cookies are small text files that are unique to your device or browser.  They can either be session-based (i.e., lasting only while your browser is open and automatically deleted when you close your browser) or persistent (i.e., lasting until you delete them or they expire).</li><li><strong> Locally stored objects. </strong>Locally stored objects (“LSOs”), also commonly called “Flash cookies,” are stored on your device or browser to provide Services that use Adobe Flash technology.</li><li><strong> Web beacons. </strong>“Web beacons” or clear GIFs are small pieces of code placed on a Service to collect data about users of that Service.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Software development kits. </strong>Mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) are bits of computer code used by mobile app developers to enable or enhance various features of a mobile app.  For example, an app developer may include an SDK within a mobile app that enables advertisements to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed in connection with the mobile app.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  We use Tracking Technologies for the following purposes:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Sign-in/authentication. </strong>When you sign into your account to use the Services, we use Tracking Technologies to store your sign-in information.  This allows the Services to remember your user preferences and give you a more tailored experience based on those preferences.  It also allows you to use the Services without having to sign-in on each page or each time you return.</li><li>We use Tracking Technologies to help detect fraud and abuse of the Services, including attempts to access the Services without authorization.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>We use Tracking Technologies to gather usage and performance data about the Services, including counting the number of unique visitors to a particular Service.</li><li>We use Tracking Technologies to track how many users have seen or clicked on an advertisement.  This allows us to learn which advertising campaigns are most effective and also to help limit the number of times a user is shown the same advertisement.</li><li><strong> Interest-based advertising. </strong>We use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your interests so that we can deliver advertising that is most relevant to your interests.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Tailoring the Services. </strong>We use Tracking Technologies to collect information about how you use the Services so that we can tailor your experience based on what is most relevant to your interests.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In some cases, we may work with third parties (for example, third party operators of the Services) to synchronize our unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with Tracking Technologies) with the third party’s own identifiers.  This enables us to better achieve each of the purposes described above.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Managing Tracking Technologies. </strong>  Most web browsers give you the ability to manage Tracking Technologies used on a website, including blocking or deleting them.  Please note that if you choose to block Tracking Technologies, you may not be able to use certain features that depend on those Tracking Technologies (such as keeping you signed in or remembering your preferences).  If you choose to delete Tracking Technologies, any settings and preferences that were associated with those Tracking Technologies will also be deleted and may need to be reset.</p></p> <div><p>  You also have the following options to manage Tracking Technologies and opt out of interest-based advertising:</p><ul>  <li>For Flash cookies, you can access Flash management tools from <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html" target="_blank"> Adobe’s website </a>. In addition, some, but not all, browsers provide the ability to remove LSOs within cookie and privacy settings.</li><li>You may opt out of interest-based advertising from companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) by visiting <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank"> their website </a>.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>You may opt out of interest-based advertising from companies that participate in the Network Advertising Initiative by visiting <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"> their website </a>.</li><li>You may opt out of Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings, by visiting <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/legal/privacy-statement/digital-measurement/" target="_blank"> their website </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>You may opt out of WarnerMedia News & Sports’ collection, use, and transfer of data for interest-based advertising by visiting the <a href="https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/opt-out" target="_blank"> WarnerMedia targeted advertising opt out page </a>within the WarnerMedia Privacy Center. Please note that if you opt out there, WarnerMedia News & Sports will continue to collect data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations.  You may continue to receive advertising from WarnerMedia News & Sports based on your activities on the Services.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Finally, you may opt-out of interest-based advertising by adjusting your device or browser settings.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean you will stop seeing, or see fewer, advertisements.  It does, however, mean that the advertisements you do see will not be interest-based and may be less relevant to your interests.</p></p> <p><p>  Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features that send an automated signal to the websites that you visit using that browser.  At this time, the Services do not recognize or respond to these signals.  However, you can adjust your preferences regarding the data we collect using the tools and methods described above.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Security of Data </strong></li></ul><p>  The NBA Family takes security seriously.  We take a number of steps to protect your data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.  These steps take into account the sensitivity of the data we collect and use, as well as the current state of technology.  This includes, for example, storing your data on systems that have limited access and are maintained in controlled facilities.  We also use, and require our vendors to use, industry standard security protocols when processing any payments for your use of the Services.</p></div> <p><p>  It is important to remember that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  We recommend that you help us keep your data safe by taking reasonable steps such as keeping your passwords private and not disclosing sensitive personal data in places that can be accessed publicly.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Third Party Sites and Sections </strong></li></ul><p>  We work with a number of third parties to operate the Services.  When we engage third parties in connection with operating the Services, those third parties may only collect, use or access your data as needed for them to perform these functions.  These third parties include:</p><ul>  <li><strong> com and other digital platforms. </strong>We have partnered with Turner Digital Basketball Services, Inc., a WarnerMedia News and Sports property, including its affiliates (“Turner”), to operate the NBA.com website, mobile site and other digital platforms in the United States.  A representative list of WarnerMedia News & Sports affiliates that may receive access to your data is available at: <a href="https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/affiliates/" target="_blank"> https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/affiliates/ </a>.  This list may be updated from time-to-time, so please check back periodically to keep up-to-date.  To learn more about how Turner collects, uses, protects and discloses your personal data, including your data rights, metrics and disclosures, please visit <a href="https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/WMNS/" target="_blank"> https://www.warnermediaprivacy.com/policycenter/b2c/WMNS/ </a>.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> NBA Local Destinations </strong>.

Your interactions with those social media providers and platforms are governed by the privacy policy of the third party providing that service.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  These third parties are only authorized to use your data as permitted under this Policy, or as disclosed to you at the time your data is collected.  Please note, however, that these third parties may supplement data collected or received in connection with the Services with data they collect or receive through other websites, platforms and services, in accordance with the policies and disclosures posted on those websites, platforms and services.  Within the past twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of personal information: personal identifiers, commercial information, Internet/other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, characteristics of protected classifications, and inferences drawn from this information.</p></p> <p><p>  The Services may also contain links to, or integrations with, other websites, platforms or services that are not operated or controlled by the NBA Family (each a “Third Party Site,” and collectively, the “Third Party Sites”).  Please note that this Policy does not apply to those Third Party Sites.  For more information on how those Third Party Sites collect, use and share data, we suggest that you contact the operators of those Third Party Sites directly.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Children and Parents </strong></li></ul><p>  Although there are NBA fans of all ages, the Services are not directed at children under the age of 16, and our policy is to not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13, nor to sell personal data of individuals under the age of 16.  We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children’s online behavior, put parental control tools in place, and teach children not to provide their personal data through the Services without parental consent.  For certain activities in which children are allowed to participate (e.g., Jr. NBA clinics), any request for personal data (such as registration data) is intended for and directed to the parent or legal guardian.</p></div> <p><p>  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal data to us without parental consent, please visit us at <a href="http://privacy.nba.com/" target="_blank"> http://privacy.nba.com </a> or contact us using any of the methods described in the “<a href="http://www.nba.com/news/privacy_policy.html#Contact_Us" target="_blank"> How to Contact Us </a>” section of this Policy, and we will endeavor to delete that data from our systems.</p></p> <p><p>  For children located in jurisdictions within the EU, we comply with the age limits applicable in each Member State.  In these instances, the references above to the age of 13 will be deemed to be references to the age limits applicable in each Member State.  Where this Policy refers to consent, this will require the consent of a parent or legal guardian in relation to any person under the age limits applicable in each Member State.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Storing Data </strong></li></ul><p>  Personal data collected by the NBA Family may be stored and processed in the region in which it is collected, in the United States, and in any other region where we maintain major operations.  We maintain offices in Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States.  We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this Policy is stored and processed in accordance with this Policy regardless of where the data is located.  By providing personal data in connection with the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such personal data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of the NBA Family and our authorized third party service providers located in the United States.  Our practice when transferring personal data is to rely on standard data protection contract clauses or individual consent.</p></div> <p><p>  We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other necessary purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and enforcing our agreements.  Because these factors vary for different types of personal data, actual retention periods may vary.  The criteria we use to determine the appropriate retention periods include:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> How long is the personal data needed to provide the Services? </strong>This is the baseline for most data retention periods.</li><li><strong> Do users expect that we will retain the personal data until they affirmatively remove it? </strong>For example, if a user is able to directly access, edit or remove the personal data at any time, we may maintain the data until the user affirmatively removes it.</li><li><strong> Is the personal data of a sensitive type? </strong>If so, a shortened data retention period will generally apply.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? </strong>If so, we will retain the data in accordance with the user’s consent.</li><li><strong> Are we subject to a legal, contractual or similar obligation to retain the personal data?
