<div><h1>  Privacy policy</h1><ul>  <li>By  </li></ul><span>  Adrien Lafond</span><ul>  <li>Updated on</li></ul><p>  EnergyWise and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “EnergyWise” or “we”) manufacture, market, and sell electronic indoor air quality measuring Devices (the “Devices”) and provide additional features such as a website located at <a href="https://foobot.io/" target="_blank"> foobot.io </a> (the “Site”), a mobile application, downloadable software, and a service to save energy (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains what kinds of information we collect, store, and use (the “Data”) when you use the Devices and the Services. This includes personally identifying information, i.e., information that can be reasonably linked to a specific individual or household (“Identifying Data”). If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@foobot.io.</p></div> <p><p>  We are always working to improve the Devices and the Services to fulfill our goal of guiding you to better indoor air quality and save energy. As a result, this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. These changes will always be promptly reflected on the Site along with a “Last Updated” date, and we will do our best to notify you via email when these changes materially affect your rights under this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  By using the Services, you agree to allow us collect, store, and use Data as described below.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> WHAT DATA DOES ENERGYWISE COLLECT? </strong></p><p>  <strong> When You Activate a Devices </strong></p><p>  You may be asked to download the Foobot mobile application, update or install the latest Devices software, and/or create a user account.</p><p>  <strong> When You Create an Account  </strong></p><p>  When you create a user account using the Site or other Services (your “Account”), we collect personally identifying information, which may include your name, company name, phone number, postal address, email address, other online account credentials (for example, your LinkedIn login information), primary language, and location in your house or building where the Devices will be used. Creating an Account allows you to use all available functions of the Service; however, you do not have to create an Account to use the Devices with limited functionality. The energy saving service requires that you create an account.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> After You Have Created An Account </strong></p><p>  After you have created your Account and used the Services for a period of time, we may ask you to answer additional survey-style questions to help improve and customize your experience and help us deliver more comprehensive indoor air quality or energy information to you. For example, we may ask how many people live in the location where you use the Devices or how large the location is, among other things. When you answer these questions, we collect this Data and store it with your other Account information.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> When You Connect the Devices to Your Account </strong></p><p>  Once you have created your Account, you will link your Devices to your Account or allow others to link it with their accounts. When the Devices is connected to your Account, environmental data collected through the sensors in your Devices is transferred to our servers. These sensors collect data such as readings of volatile organic compounds (“VOC”), particulate matter (“PM”), temperature, and humidity. They can also detect when the Devices is moved. Through data analytics, we then use this environmental Data to draw certain conclusions about the Devices’s environment. For example, by analyzing Data collected by the Devices, we may determine that the Devices was placed near an open window or that cleaning products were recently used in the space where the Devices is located. These are assumptions made based on an analysis of the Data collected and are not guaranteed to be an accurate representation of what actually occurred in the space where the Devices is located. The Devices may also transmit certain log data to your Account and to the Services, such as the time Data is transmitted and the IP address from which it is transmitted.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> When Your Devices Encounters a Problem </strong></p><p>  While our goal is to ensure that your Devices is operating properly at all times, we understand that at times the Devices may encounter an issue transmitting information, connecting to the Services, or collecting environmental Data. To continually improve your experience, when the Devices encounters a problem, a report may automatically be sent to us so that we can help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter. This report may contain information about your Devices model, serial number, software version, and other technical information.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> When You Contact Customer Service </strong></p><p>  Our customer service team is always here to help. When you contact customer service, we may collect personally identifying information (name, email address, IP address, Devices information, Account information), product information (Devices model, serial number, software version) and any other information you may provide.</p><p>  <strong> When You Access the Site </strong></p><p>  When you access the Site, we may use cookies and other technologies to improve the Site and your experience.</p></div> <div><p>  Please consult our Cookies Policy for more information about our cookies management policy</p><p>  <strong> WHERE IS DATA STORED? </strong></p><p>  We collect, process, and store your Data through our third-party service providers, which currently include Amazon, Google Analytics, Stripe, Shopify, Easyship, Gigya, PayPal and Mixpanel. We use industry-standard technical and administrative security methods to keep your Data secure while it is transmitted from your network to our cloud servers or the cloud servers of our third-party service providers.

We use the Data to provide predictive analytics to detect and analyze patterns and changes in indoor air pollution or energy consumption. We aggregate the Data to better understand the causes of indoor air pollution and energy consumption and ways to decrease them. The Data also helps us make technological improvements to the Devices and the Services.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong>  HOW IS IDENTIFYING DATA SHARED? </strong></p><p>  We collect Identifying Data to provide the Services.
