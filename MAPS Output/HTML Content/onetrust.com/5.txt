</h3><p>  Currently, unlike Europe’s GDPR, there isn’t a comprehensive US privacy law. The enactment of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) on January 1, 2020 marked the first comprehensive US state privacy law aimed to protect consumers’ personal data security. Since then, many states have followed suit with their own privacy legislation. </p></div> <div><h3>  What are the privacy laws in the US?
</h3><p>  More than 10 states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws. Many others have introduced bills for committee evaluation. In addition to comprehensive state-level laws, the US also has privacy laws that govern specific types of data. For example, HIPAA is a federal law that protects sensitive patient health information and COPPA protects children’s online privacy.  </p><p>  <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/comparisons/usa-privacy-laws" target="_blank"> Explore the DataGuidance US privacy tracker </a> to learn more about emerging and new laws. </p></div> <div><h3>  What’s the difference between US and EU data privacy laws?
</h3><p>  The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) focuses on a person’s right to privacy whereas much of the US legislation focuses on the data security safeguards of consumers and employees. Regardless of whether your business is located in the EU or US, or other countries with data privacy laws, if data is processed across borders, relevant privacy and data protection laws apply. </p><p>  Our <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/solutions/privacy-and-data-governance-cloud/" target="_blank"> Privacy and Data Governance Cloud </a> can simplify how you comply with the various requirements of privacy regulations. </p></div> <div><h2>  Ready to get started?</h2></div> <div><h1>  Request a free demo today to see how OneTrust can guide your US privacy compliance journey.</h1><span>  Request demo</span><span>  Free trial</span></div> <div><h1>  Your partner in trust transformation</h1></div> <div><h3>  Top Searches</h3><ul>  <li>Trust Center
