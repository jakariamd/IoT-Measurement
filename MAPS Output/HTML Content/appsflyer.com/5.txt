It provides the ability to compute and analyze joint datasets, and derive business insights, without exposing individual user-level data.</p></div> <div><h3>  What are the key benefits of AppsFlyer Privacy Cloud?</h3><ul>  <li>Collaborate with your partners in safe Data Clean Room environments</li><li>Avoid attribution data blind spots with conversion data and insights that aren’t available from other attribution solutions</li><li>Enrich your 1st party data with attribution data and complement it with data in the Data Clean Room</li><li>Gain full control of your data by configuring exactly what is shared within the Privacy Cloud, and defining data aggregation levels, granularity and more</li><li>Bring your own business logic, or leverage AppsFlyer’s business logic such as Aggregated Advanced Privacy (AAP), lift measurement (incrementality), audience segmentation, mobile fraud, SKAN measurement, predictive analytics and more.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Comply with all privacy regulations, policies, and guidelines</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  How can meaningful insights be generated when data output is fully aggregated?</h3><p>  Having campaign optimization and retargeting efforts rely on user-level data is no longer a viable solution. It compromises users’ privacy and creates significant data blind spots. Recent privacy changes in the industry have made it very clear: it’s time for a new way forward. Deep campaign insights and great marketing decisions can be made based on aggregated data, as long as the data is: </p><ul>  <li>Accurate</li><li>Complete</li><li>Generated from user-level data (that remains within the Data Clean Room)</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Is AppsFlyer Privacy Cloud fully compliant with Apple App Store and Google Play policies?</h3><p>  Yes. The Privacy Cloud is preconfigured based on the privacy guidelines set by the various platforms. These preconfigured settings are constantly being updated as new privacy guidelines are being rolled out by Apple, Google (and/or any other platforms and partners) to make sure you are always aligned with their latest requirements.</p></div> <div><h3>  Are there cases in which user-level data will be shared outside of the Privacy Cloud?</h3><p>  If user-level data sharing is allowed (based on the specific partner and platform privacy guidelines, privacy laws applicable to you and user consent) and that’s what you require, then yes, user-level data can still be shared.</p></div> <div><h3>  What sets AppsFlyer apart from other Data Clean Room solutions?</h3><ul>  <li>We are 100% unbiased and independent.
