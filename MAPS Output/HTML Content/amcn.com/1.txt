If the Services we provide to you are not governed by a contract, we use your personal information to meet our legitimate interests in providing quality Services to you;</li><li>Process transactions, as necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you;</li><li>Improve the Services and learn about how visitors use the Services. For example, we aim to improve the Services by creating content, features, and interfaces that reflect consumer interests as inferred by user activity. We do so in order to further our legitimate interest in offering services, content, and products that are appealing and useful to you and others;</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Respond to your requests for information, which supports our legitimate interests in providing excellent customer service and which may be necessary to enter into contracts with you or to fulfill our contractual obligations to you;</li><li>Communicate with you about the status of your account or your purchases, such as emailing you regarding payments or subscription terms, contacting you regarding shipping for purchases, notifying you when your subscription is about to expire, or notifying you of changes to this Policy or our Terms of Use. In many instances we send these communications to enter into contracts with you or to fulfill our contractual obligations. When not transmitted for contractual purposes, we send these communications to meet our legitimate interests in providing you with excellent customer service;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Identify, prevent, and investigate activities that may be illegal or prohibited, including fraud and violations of our terms of use. We do so to fulfill our legitimate interests in protecting our rights and interests;</li><li>Comply with legal obligations, such as those involving Content restrictions, records of marketing opt outs, and legally required notices; and</li><li>Protect our rights, your rights, and the rights of others, as it is within our legitimate interests to meet our standards of business practice.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We may also use your personal information, as permitted by applicable law, for additional purposes, including to:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>communicate with you about our Content, products and Services, or the products and services offered by third parties, such as information about Content and features on the Services, new releases, or available streaming platforms. If required by applicable law, we will only send such marketing messages on the basis that you have consented. Where consent is not required and where we have not obtained consent, we send such marketing communications to fulfill our legitimate interests in promoting our products and services. You can always opt out of receiving marketing communications by following the steps described in Section 8 below;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>learn or make inferences about your interests in order to fulfil our legitimate interests in identifying how to expand our business opportunities and deliver the Content, services, and features, that you wish to use and interact with;</li><li>customize the Content presented to you via the Services or in our communications. For example, we may use information about your general location to present local Content to you. Or we may use the inferences we have drawn about your interests to provide personalized recommendations, marketing, or other content to you via the Services. We do so subject to your consent where required or to fulfill our legitimate interests in providing you and other users with relevant Content and information, thereby making the Services more appealing.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>personalize your experience and customize the Content and advertisements you receive from us and our trusted partners, including targeted advertising . For example, if you view certain Content on the Services, we may deliver ads related to that Content on the Services or other online platforms. And we or third parties may collect information about your online activities over time and across various online services to infer your interests.  We may use that information to deliver relevant advertising to you on the Services or other online platforms. We do this to fulfill our legitimate interests in expanding our business opportunities by providing you with information about products, offers, and services that may interest you and, where required, we do so based on your consent. For more information about interest-based advertising and the choices you may have, please see our Cookies Policy.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Please note that in jurisdictions where legitimate interests are not recognized as a lawful basis for processing personal data, AMC generally obtains consent.</p></p> <p><p>  In addition to the data uses identified above, we may aggregate or mask information we have collected so that it no longer reasonably identifies you, and we may use and disclose such information for any purpose, including without limitation in statistical analyses to help us analyze patterns in the use of the Services.</p></p> <p><p>  When we process information to further our legitimate interests, we take steps to balance those interests with yours. Please contact us via the channels listed in Section 8 for more information.</p></p> <div><p>  Automated Processing</p><p>  When we analyze the information we collect for advertising, marketing, security, and fraud prevention, we use automated processes to identify or predict potential risks or outcomes. For example, we may use the information you provide us and information about your online activities to infer your interests. And we use those inferences to support automated decisions about the Content, recommendations, and offers we present to you on our digital properties. We use automated tools to identify suspicious activities associated with the Services (e.g., multiple logins from different locations within a short period of time). These automated processing activities will not, without human intervention, have legal or similar effects for you.</p></div> <div><h2>  5. HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?</h2><p>  We share your personal information for our operational business purposes, including with other organizations that act on our behalf in connection with operating our business and the Services.
