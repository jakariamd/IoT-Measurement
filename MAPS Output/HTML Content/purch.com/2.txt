Our web beacons don’t store any information on your computer but, by communicating with our cookies on your computer, they can tell us which emails you’re interacting with and how you’re interacting with them. For example, we will know when you have opened an email from us and the devices used. We may keep track of the emails that we send you and may use the information we collect to personalise the emails we send to you. We also keep a record of the communications you have selected to receive or not to receive, for example whether you would like to only receive brand marketing from a particular brand, or that you have agreed to receive </td></div> <span><span>  emails deemed of interest to you from other brands within the Group. </span></span> <td><td>  We may also use your email in a hashed, unidentifiable form to help us understand your online behaviour. </td></td> <span><span>  This may in turn be used for analytics and targeting. </span></span> <span><span>  For use of your email for advertising purposes, see below.

This code does not contain any of your identifiable personal data and cannot be used to re-identify you. </td></div> <td><td>  We place this code in our first-party cookie or use a partner’s cookie, and allow it to be used for online and cross-channel advertising. This hashed, pseudonymous code may be shared with our advertising partners and other third-party advertising companies globally for the purpose of enabling interest-based content or targeted advertising throughout your online experience (e.g. web, email, connected devices, and in-app, etc). These third parties may in turn use this code to link demographic or interest-based information you have provided in your interactions with them. 
</td></td> <td><td>  For example, one of these third parties is LiveRamp who </td></td> <div><span>  acting as “joint controllers” (as applicable and defined in the GDPR) </span><span>  use the information to create an online identification code that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online, in-app, and cross-channel advertising.

As a result other websites, apps, advertisers, and advertising companies are able to show you relevant advertising.

This may also involve giving you access to the areas of a website that directly interacts with or makes use of YouTube APIs. This enables us to collect other information needed to upload content such as the source of the video, (for example, from an existing article or original content or playlist), also analytical data such as view counts, and how long watched. We will also use the information you provide us with, such as bank details, to ensure we pay you the correct fees for the content you provide for us.</span></div> <div><td>  Research Surveys</td><td>  We may use the information you provide to invite you to participate in surveys and focus groups about our products, clients and services.

We may also receive data from other sources, such as our business partners, Group companies and social media platforms. For example, when you visit one of our Facebook pages. Other information, such as inferred data and demographics data, may also be collected and used to match, combine and enrich profile information we hold on you.

Also location information, such as country, and state (or county), and ZIP code (or postcode).  </span></div> <span><span>  We typically collect this information directly when you complete registration forms or when you provide other information through our Website or via email. When we collect this information directly, we let you know if providing the information is optional or if it is required to provide our Services.</span></span> <div><td>  Occasionally we may purchase business data from third-party </td><span>  suppliers which may include, for example, business email address, business job title and business postal address.

Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this website and other websites you have visited. This third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products or websites you might be interested in. We may also use an audience or traffic measurement service to analyse the traffic on this website.

This includes sharing data with advertising networks and search engines, in order for us to deliver relevant advertising to you, based on what you appear to be interested in. For example when you are searching for information or browsing other sites.</p></div> <p><p>  This could also be in the form of an anonymous data segment or an online identification code called a privacy-protective identifier. (A privacy-protective identifier is where we convert the original information, such as an email address or phone number, into a value to keep the original information from being revealed). </p></p> <span><span>  These third parties may use this code to link demographic or interest-based information you have provided in your interactions with them in order to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, enable interest-based content or provide you with targeted advertising.

This enables us to understand your preferences and to show you personalised advertising even if you are currently on another website within the network.</p></div> <div><p>  <b> Social media </b></p><p>  We may also share de-identified information with social media platforms for advertising purposes. For example, </p><span>  we may share a hashed, non-identifiable version of your email with, for example, Facebook or Google, with the aim of showing you advertising on those platforms.

This includes:</span><ul>  <li>helping improve infrastructure and delivery systems;</li><li>understanding how our services or theirs are used;</li><li>promoting safety, security and integrity across the Future Group e.g. securing systems and fighting spam, threats, abuse, or infringement activities;</li></ul></div> <p><p>  In addition, a</p></p> <span><span>   key way we share data across systems and Group companies is for advertising and targeting purposes. This can be based on your online behaviour on our sites, for example:</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>When you go onto one of our brand sites we can track your behaviour on those sites, or any of our other sites across our Group companies, and use this to target advertising or email content to you. </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  For example, if you use a technology site such as techradar to look for ‘best iphones’, or GoCompare for phone insurance, we can see if you later visited one of our other sites and you may see advertising for iphones and/or insurance based on this. If you would prefer to opt out, you can do so via the consent management pop-up.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>This also applies if you open an email from us and this takes you online as we can use the information from your online behaviour to later target marketing to you. </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  So for example if you subscribe to marketing emails on one of our women’s sites and we see you have looked at phone content on our other sites we may provide you with phone related content in your marketing emails from the woman’s site. You can unsubscribe from emails at any time.</span></span> <div><ul>  <li>We may also upload emails </li></ul><span>  (in hashed, pseudonymous form) </span><span>  straight to the advertising data system and this enables us to identify the same non-identifiable user across devices. So we know, for example, that the person who looks at Future home content on their phone and then Future fashion content on their desktop, is in fact the same non-identified person. </span><span>  You can unsubscribe from emails at any time.</span><ul>  <li>We may also use the other data you have provided to us, combined with your online behaviour, to personalise your email campaigns. For example, if you signed up to Future marketing emails when browsing our home sites, we may classify you as a ‘home intender’ for marketing purposes. Later when you go online we may see you are also interested in content on pets and classify you as a ‘home and pet intender’. As a result you may see content on home and pet insurance provided by our GoCompare brand, in the emails we send to you. You can unsubscribe from emails at any time.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Please note in the above scenarios where marketing is involved, the emails you receive will only be from Future, unless you have opted in to receive marketing from Group Companies.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES </strong></p><p>  Our websites may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and, when you leave our website, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit. We may monetise some of these links through the use of third-party affiliate programmes. These affiliate links help pay the costs of producing our websites and ensure that the content is free to you. However, it doesn’t mean that we are in any way indebted to Amazon or any other company. Nor do they or any other company have any influence over editorial coverage, how we rate products, or whether they get a positive review.  Notwithstanding such affiliate programmes, we are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these websites or for third-party advertisers, nor for the way in which they use the information they collect about you.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> STORAGE AND RETENTION OF DATA </strong></p><p>  We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your data will vary depending on the services or products we are providing. We will only keep your data for a reasonable period of time, which is based on the purpose for which we are using your data. </p><p>  Once that purpose has been fulfilled, we will securely delete that data or anonymise your information (so that we, or anyone else, can no longer tell that data relates to you) unless we are required to retain the data longer for legal, tax or accounting reasons.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> DATA SECURITY </strong></p><p>  We are committed to protecting the personal data we hold and </p><span>  keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. </span><p>  Where we use third-party service providers to store data, we have appropriate agreements in place to ensure that your personal data is protected. </p><span>  In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. </span></div> <span><span>  We also require any third parties to whom we may transfer personal data to have appropriate security measures in place. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. </span></span> <p><p>  Our websites may permit you to create an account, or have the facility for an account to be created on your behalf. When this happens, you will be prompted to create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account. If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us at dpo@futurenet.com.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER </strong></p><p>  We operate a global business, so your personal data may be processed in a country other than your country of residence. For example, if you are UK citizen you may find your data is processed by  a supplier or service based outside the UK or EEA, </p><span>  such as in the United States. </span><span>  If such a transfer requires us to apply additional safeguards to your personal information under, for example, UK or European data protection laws, we will do so. These steps may include implementing the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement clauses or European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, with additional UK-specific clauses for transfers of personal information to our service providers and business partners. To the extent applicable, we may rely on derogations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR for the transfer and onward transfer of personal information collected from individuals in the UK or EEA to the United States, and other countries that the EU views as not providing adequate data protection. Specifically, we may transfer such information to another party in accordance with our lawful basis for processing.</span></div> <p><p>  By using our website, products or services or by interacting with us in the ways described in this Privacy Notice, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information outside your country of residence, including out of the  EEA, in the circumstances set out in this Privacy Notice. If you do not want your information to be transferred in this way you should not use our website, applications or services.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> PROTECTING CHILDREN’S PRIVACY </strong></p><p>  We recognise the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal information we may collect from children in connection with our products and services. Some of the features on our sites and applications are age-gated so that they are not available for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with those features. When we intend to collect personal information from children, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;</li><li>In accordance with applicable law, and our practices, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Limiting our collection of personal information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and</li><li>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For additional information about our practices in the United States regarding children’s personal information, please read our </p></p> <div><span>  Children’s Privacy Policy</span><p>  <strong> SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS </strong></p><p>  We operate accounts on different social media platforms.

The social media platform also provides us with anonymous usage statistics, which we use to improve user experience. We do not have access to the usage data that the operator of the social network collects to create these statistics. For information on the social media operators and their privacy policies, please </p></p> <div><span>  click here</span><p>  Certain sites offer services that require you to set up an account prior to receiving such services. To create a secure account you can use your email address and a password or, if the site offers a Facebook single-sign-on service, you will be able to register for and log-in to your account using your Facebook account. If you choose to use the Facebook single-sign-on service, you are granting permission to Facebook to share certain profile information with us. This may include your name, profile picture, and list of friends and any other information notified to you by Facebook prior to you completing the single-sign-on authorisation process. You control what social information you allow us to have access to using the privacy settings on the applicable media platform and any permissions you give as part of the single-sign-on authorisation process.</p></div> <p><p>  In addition, some social media platforms, such as Facebook, use cookies that are stored on your terminal device when you visit our social media account, even if you do not have your own profile in the network or are not logged in.

It does not include: (i) information that is lawfully made available from federal, state or local government records; (ii) de-identified or aggregated data; or (iii) information excluded from the scope of the CCPA/CPRA. </span><p>  On some occasions,  in order to provide our Services to our clients, we may process service data that we receive from or on behalf of our clients. If you are a California resident, you may have certain CCPA rights with regards to this information. Under the CCPA, when we act as a “service provider” (as opposed to a “business” or a “third party”) over such information, we only process your information in a way required to provide our services to our clients, at our clients’ direction. If you wish to exercise any of your rights under CCPA regarding such information, please contact the relevant business that collected the information from you, as they controls and determine how your information is processed.</p></div> <p><p>  As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Information. </b></li></ul></ul> <div><span>    You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:
</span><ul>  <li>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</li><li>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</li><li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</li><li>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li><li>Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.  
</li><li><b> Access </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>  .  You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months. </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Deletion.   </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>  You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Opt-out of sales. </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>    Future does not “sell” any of your personal information in exchange for money. However, the term “sell” has a broader meaning under the CCPA/CPRA than would ordinarily be understood in a non-legal context. If we “sell” your Personal Information, you can opt-out. In addition, if you direct us not to “sell” your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. </span></span> <p><p>  In the past 12 months, we have shared your Personal Information with third parties in the following circumstances, which California law classifies as a “sale” of your Personal Information:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>supplying your data to third parties with your express consent (e.g. where you opt-in to receive third party marketing or where you have requested to be contacted by a third party);</li><li>with third-party marketing partners, including list brokers, for commercial use; </li><li>supplying attendee data to third parties who provide services in connection with our events, and sending your data to suppliers of certain products and services (where you have consented to hear from such third parties); </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>promotional partners, such as when you enter a promotion, contest or sweepstake;</li><li>like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads, content and services to you and may transfer personal information to business partners for their use.  California law classifies our use of these services as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services. This is because we allow them to collect information from our website users (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help serve ads, content and services more likely to interest you. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Opt-in.   </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>  If we know that you are younger than 16 years old, we will ask for your parent or guardian’s permission to sell your Personal Information before we do so.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Nondiscrimination. </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>    You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination. This means that we will not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such as denying you services; increasing the price/rate of services; decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you as described above for exercising your rights.  </span></span> <p><p>  <b> How to exercise your right to information, access, deletion  </b></p></p> <div><p>  You may exercise your California privacy rights by submitting a </p><span>  request form</span><span>   or emailing privacyofficer@futurenet.com quoting ‘California Privacy Rights-(insert name of Future Group brand)’ in the subject header and state which right(s) you wish to exercise. </span><p>  <b> How to exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information </b></p><p>  <b> For internet and mobile users (online third parties) </b></p><span>  .
