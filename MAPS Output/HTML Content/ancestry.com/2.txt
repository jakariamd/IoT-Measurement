Additionally, and with particular regard to our subscribers and DNA customers who pay fees or purchase subscriptions, the ongoing enhancement of our collections of historical records and DNA features provide benefits and insights to our Users over time. As a result, our retention practices reflect this ongoing value by retaining user accounts on our system until our Users inform us of their desire to delete their data or close their accounts.</p></p> <div><td>  <b> Account and Profile </b></td><td>  Ancestry will retain the Personal Information you provide while creating your account and your profile until such time as you delete your account.</td><td>  <b> Family Tree </b></td><td>  Due to the multi-generational significance of family trees, Ancestry will retain your family tree data to provide you with continuous access, updated features, and the ability to enhance your family tree. Your family tree data is kept until you delete your family tree or your account.</td></div> <div><td>  <b> DNA </b></td><td>  Ancestry retains your DNA Data to provide you with the features and functionality you purchased (or were gifted), including continuously updated features such as DNA matches, increasingly granular ethnicity estimates and improved regions and communities, as well as new other features based on your DNA Data. Your DNA Data is kept until you delete your DNA test results or your account.</td><p>  If you were a customer of AncestryHealth, our AncestryHealth laboratory partners are required to retain your DNA Data and test result for a period of at least seven years, or as required by state law and the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (CLIA) and the guidelines that apply to laboratories certified by the College of American Pathologists (CAP). </p></div> <div><td>  <b> Related Brands </b></td><td>  Some of our related brands (Fold3, Newspapers.com™, Find a Grave, We Remember, or Archives) have their own account logins and will retain the Personal Information you provide while creating your account and your profile as needed to provide you with continuous and updated Services until such time as you ask us to delete it.</td><td>  <b> Usage Information </b></td><td>  We retain usage information (e.g., visits to sites) in a depersonalized or aggregated form. Once aggregated, this information ceases to be Personal Information and will not be subject to user deletion requests.</td></div> <p><p>  <b> 10.  How Can I Delete My Personal Information? </b></p></p> <p><p>  You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry at any time.</p></p> <div><td>  <b> Personal Information </b></td><td>  You can delete your Personal Information from Ancestry by <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/article/Deleting-Your-Ancestry-Account" target="_blank"> following these instructions </a>. </td><p>  If you have shared information with other Users (for example, by making your family trees public or by sharing your DNA Results directly with other Users), Ancestry will not be able to remove any copies of information that other Users may have retained, which can only be removed by your contacting the other User and asking them to delete it. </p></div> <p><p>  Please direct any request to remove information from linked archival records to the responsible archival entity. </p></p> <p><p>  We will consider requests for removal of Personal Information from the searchable indexes of the records we hold on a case-by-case basis in accordance with law. </p></p> <p><p>  For information on Personal Information processed by Ancestry relating to non-Ancestry users please click <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/cs/legal/nonuser" target="_blank"> here </a>. </p></p> <div><td>  <b> Genetic </b></td><td>  <b> Please note </b>: If you request that Ancestry delete your DNA Data, we will delete <u> all </u> Genetic Information, including any derivative Genetic Information (ethnicity estimates, genetic relative matches, etc.) from our production, development, analytics, and research systems within 30 days.</td><p>  To request the destruction of your Biological Samples, you must contact <a href="https://support.ancestry.com/s/contactsupport" target="_blank"> Member Services </a>.
