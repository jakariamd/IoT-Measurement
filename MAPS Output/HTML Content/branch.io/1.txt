We do not let customers access data beyond the interactions they have directly with their own users.</p></div> <div><h3>  We do not rent or sell personal data</h3><p>  Your data is your data no matter what. Neither your competitors nor any other company will ever have access to it. We are not in the business of renting or selling any customer’s end-user data to anyone else.</p></div> <div><h2>  Privacy advocacy</h2><p>  Branch is committed not just to protecting the privacy of our own customers’ data, but also to advocating for transparency, user control, and the advancement of responsible data practices in the industry at large.</p><p>  Branch is a proud member of the <a href="https://fpf.org/about/advisory-board/" target="_blank"> Future of Privacy Forum’s Advisory Board </a>, alongside Adobe, Bank of America, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p><p>  This non-profit organization brings together industry leaders, academics, and consumer advocates to explore the challenges posed by technology innovation and to develop privacy protections, ethical norms, and workable business practices.</p></div> <div><h4>  GDPR & CCPA</h4><p>  At Branch, our goal is to help our customers meet both the letter and the spirit of privacy laws and regulations, including GDPR and CCPA, in a simple and straightforward way. We believe these are not simply legal requirements; respecting the privacy rights of all customers and their users is the right thing to do.</p><p>  Over the years, we’ve invested heavily in ensuring that our customers can use our products in compliance with these privacy laws, and we will continue to invest in industry-leading data privacy initiatives.</p></div> <div><h2>   Our security best practices</h2><p>  Comprehensive security program</p></div> <div><h3>  Dedicated Security Team</h3><p>  All members of the Branch security team are credentialed to the highest industry standard and bring deep expertise in cloud application security to continuously evolve security and governance practices in response to ever-shifting threats.</p></div> <div><h3>  Product Security</h3><p>  Our secure software development lifecycle enforces diligent security reviews, secure coding practices, and continuous security testing using a mix of internal/external penetration tests and independent third-party security programs.</p></div> <div><h2>  Security is in our DNA</h2><p>  State of the art security measures to meet growing customer needs and security challenges</p></div> <div><h3>  Cloud security</h3><ul>  <li>Physical security controls</li><li>Intrusion detection and prevention</li><li>Virus and malware protection</li><li>Vulnerability detection and management</li><li>Security patch management</li><li>Continuous security information and event management (SIEM)</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Data security</h3><ul>  <li>Industry-strength data encryption in transit and at rest</li><li>Data leakage prevention solution</li><li>Proactive security monitoring to secure data and assets</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  Meet our security and privacy leaders</h4><p>  Head of Security</p><p>  At Branch, Jamie Fullerton leads the Information Security Program and Security Team.
