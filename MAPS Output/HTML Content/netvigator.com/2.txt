                  the world in respect of the protections they provide to an individual. 
                  As such, the Company undertakes to apply, where practicable, 
                  those principles and the processes set out herein to its operations

                  applied so far as practicable and consistent with such local 
                  legislation. For further details on the Company's compliance
