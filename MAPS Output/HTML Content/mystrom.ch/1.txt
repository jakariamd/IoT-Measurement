If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to the processing of data, your data will be deleted insofar as we have no other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the data will be deleted after these reasons no longer apply.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> General information on the legal basis for the processing of data on this website </strong></p><p>  If you have consented to the processing of data, we will process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 (a) of the GDPR, or Art. 9 Para. 2 (a) of the GDPR, if special data categories according to Art. 9 Para. 1 of the GDPR are processed. In the event of express consent to have personal data sent to third countries, then the processing of data will also be based on Art. 49 Para. 1 (a) of the GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to accessing information on your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), then the processing of data will also be carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) of the Telecommunication Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG). Consent is revocable at any time. If your data is required to fulfil the contract or to carry out pre-contractual measures, then we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 (b) of the GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is required to fulfil a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 (c) of the GDPR. The processing of data can also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) of the GDPR.

When these tools are active, your personal data can be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that in these countries, no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. As such, it cannot be ruled out that US authorities (for example, intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for surveillance purposes. We have no influence over these processing activities.</p></div> <div><p>  Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</p><p>  A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us.

IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR).</p></div> <p><p>  IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING.

No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We use newsletter service providers to process the newsletter. They are described in the following section.</p></p> <p><p>  The processing of the information entered into the newsletter subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the archiving of data, the e-mail address and the use of this information for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for instance by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place to date.</p></p> <p><p>  The data you archive with us for the purpose of the newsletter subscription shall be archived by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Once you cancel your subscription to the newsletter, the data shall be deleted. This shall not affect data we have been archiving for other purposes.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> MailChimp </strong></p><p>  This website uses the services of MailChimp to send out its newsletters. The provider is the Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p><p>  Among other things, MailChimp is a service that can be deployed to organise and analyse the sending of newsletters. Whenever you enter data for the purpose of subscribing to a newsletter (e.g. your e-mail address), the information is stored on MailChimp servers in the United States.</p></div> <p><p>  MailChimp is in possession of a certification that is in compliance with the “EU-US-Privacy-Shield.” The “Privacy-Shield” is a compact between the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA) that aims to warrant the compliance with European data protection standards in the United States.</p></p> <p><p>  With the assistance of the MailChimp tool, we can analyse the performance of our newsletter campaigns. If you open an e-mail that has been sent through the MailChimp tool, a file that has been integrated into the e-mail (a so-called web-beacon) connects to MailChimp’s servers in the United States. As a result, it can be determined whether a newsletter message has been opened and which links the recipient possibly clicked on. Technical information is also recorded at that time (e.g. the time of access, the IP address, type of browser and operating system). This information cannot be allocated to the respective newsletter recipient. Their sole purpose is the performance of statistical analyses of newsletter campaigns. The results of such analyses can be used to tailor future newsletters to the interests of their recipients more effectively.</p></p> <p><p>  If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analysed by MailChimp, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. We provide a link to do this in every newsletter we send.</p></p> <p><p>  The data is processed based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR).  You may revoke any consent you have given at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing transactions that have taken place prior to your revocation.</p></p> <p><p>  The data you archive with us for the purpose of the newsletter subscription shall be archived by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Once you cancel your subscription to the newsletter, the data shall be deleted from our servers as well as those of MailChimp. This shall not affect data we have been archiving for other purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  Transfer of data to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. You can find details here: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/eu-us-data-transfer-statement/" target="_blank"> https://mailchimp.com/eu-us-data-transfer-statement/ </a> und <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/#Annex_C_-_Standard_Contractual_Clauses" target="_blank"> https://mailchimp.com/legal/data-processing-addendum/#Annex_C_-_Standard_Contractual_Clauses </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be saved in a blacklist either with us or the newsletter service provider if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used solely for this purpose and is not combined with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements for sending newsletters (legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) of the GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. <b> You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interests. </b></p></p> <p><p>  For details, see MailChimp’s privacy policy at: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/" target="_blank"> https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/ </a>.</p></p> <div><p>  Execution of a contract data processing agreement</p><p>  We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) with the aforementioned provider. This is a contract prescribed by data protection laws, which ensures that they only process the personal data of our website visitors in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.</p><ul>  <li>Data processing in connection with the use of myStrom software applications</li></ul><p>  <strong> Collection of general personal data </strong></p></div> <p><p>  If you use and register our software applications, personal data will be collected.</p></p> <p><p>  The collection of this data takes place for the implementation of the user agreement between us and the software users (Art. 6 para. 1 clause 1 letter b GDPR). With regard to voluntary information, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 clause 1 letter f GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in collecting voluntary information from our users.</p></p> <div><p>  Data collection and storage in the context of software use</p><p>  If you use myStrom’s software applications, usage data is collected. This data will be deleted if the customer deletes their myStrom account, and is otherwise kept for a maximum of 60 weeks.</p><p>  Remote access for the purpose of software maintenance</p><p>  For the purpose of control, configuration, updating and similar, myStrom is entitled to access the customer’s infrastructure used for the service provision and to view, modify, update, delete or otherwise control existing technical data or software (hereinafter referred to as “software maintenance”). Via remote access, myStrom gets an insight into the customer’s technical data, which is directly related to the configuration of myStrom’s hardware, software and services.</p></div> <p><p>  No storage or other processing of the personal data beyond the inspection takes place.</p></p> <p><p>  The legal basis for the processing of data is Art. 6 Para. 1 (b) of the GDPR and Section 25 Para. 2 No. 2 of the Telecommunication Telemedia Data Protection Act (TTDSG), since software maintenance is required to fulfil the contract and is based on a service that is expressly requested by the customer. Furthermore, data processing is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) of the GDPR as the maintenance of software services is a legitimate interest of myStrom.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> Connection to third-party devices via an API </b></p><p>  myStrom’s app offers its customers the option of connecting to third-party devices in their households via an interface (API) in order to control the third-party devices via myStrom’s app. With this connection, no personal data is transmitted to the provider of the third-party device.</p><p>  From a contractual point of view, myStrom only owes the transmission of data that is required to control the third-party devices. Under data protection law, myStrom is therefore responsible for the data transmission process that takes place via the API. For all the processing of data that takes place after the transmission process has been completed, the respective provider is solely responsible for the transferred data. Here, it is about the transferring of data from one independent controller to another independent controller (controller to controller). You can find details in the privacy policy of the third-party provider.</p></div> <p><p>  The personal data via the API is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 (b) of the GDPR.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Alarms, emergency notifications and warnings in the app </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The customer can activate alarm functions within the app. To do so, the customer stores their telephone number and, if they wish, a second telephone number (of a trusted person).
If the software registers a specific event (e.g. activation of devices in an empty apartment), a call is made to the stored telephone number or another predefined action is triggered.
Data are processed in accordance with Art. 6 (1) b GDPR (Performance of the Contract).</p></p> <p><p>  The data of the contact person are processed on the basis of the consent of the trusted person (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR); the trusted person may revoke this consent at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  The telephone numbers can be deleted independently by the customer at any time. In addition, any trusted person may at any time request the deletion of their data from the provider of the myStrom app.</p></p> <p><p>  The telephone numbers are used exclusively for the call alarms.</p></p> <p><p>  The data will be deleted if the app is uninstalled or the customer or the trusted person requests deletion of the data. In addition, the operator of the app may delete the telephone numbers if they are factually incorrect or contain an unauthorised number (e.g. an inadmissible value-added number).</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Access rights of mobile Apps </strong></p><p>  If you install our mobile apps, they require access rights. The legal basis for access is your consent, which you gave during installation (Art. 6 Para. 1 (a) of the GDPR).</p><ul>  <li><strong> Designation of a data protection officer as mandated by law (GDPR contact) </strong></li></ul><p>  VGS Datenschutzpartner UG
