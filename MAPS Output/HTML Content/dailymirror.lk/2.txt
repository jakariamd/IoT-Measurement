Those expenses were incurred by the Chinese investing party and NOT GoSL or the People of Sri Lanka. By trying to show that you are an expert, you exhibitted your nakedness. </p></div> <div><ul>  <li>Bankrupt Country </li></ul><small>  Tuesday, 15 August 2023 05:02 PM  </small><p>  Don't worry,  the money going down the drain  is not of the Government or Bundula's but of the Poor Tax Payers'.</p><p>
