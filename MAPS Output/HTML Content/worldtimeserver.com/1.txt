        Log Files</h4><p>  
        As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files.
        The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address,
        your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Verizon), the browser you used
        to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our
        site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</p><p>  
        The information in our log files is used simply to monitor our WorldTimeServer.com
        web site to both ensure it is performing as we expect and to help troubleshoot any
        problems when they crop up.</p></div> <div><h4>  

        Cookies and Web Beacons</h4><p>  
        We use first-party cookies from WorldTimeServer.com to store information, but this

        when you visit our site.</p><p>  
        We also use third party advertisements on WorldTimeServer.com to support our site.

        they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google
        through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your
        ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have
        Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing
        New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain
        ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who
        frequents cooking sites).</p></div> <p><p>  We use Google Analytics to analyze the use of our website. Google Analytics gathers information about website use by means of cookies.

Mediavine serves content and advertisements when you visit the Website, which may use first and third-party cookies. A cookie is a small text file which is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so that a website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the Website.</p></div> <p><p>  First party cookies are created by the website that you are visiting. A third-party cookie is frequently used in behavioral advertising and analytics and is created by a domain other than the website you are visiting. Third-party cookies, tags, pixels, beacons and other similar technologies (collectively, “Tags”) may be placed on the Website to monitor interaction with advertising content and to target and optimize advertising. Each internet browser has functionality so that you can block both first and third-party cookies and clear your browser’s cache. The "help" feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to receive notification of new cookies, how to disable existing cookies and how to clear your browser’s cache. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank"> All About Cookies </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of the Website content and features. Please note that rejecting cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site. In the event you opt-out, you will still see non-personalized advertisements on the Website.</p></p> <div><p>  The Website collects the following data using a cookie when serving personalized ads:</p><ul>  <li>IP Address</li><li>Operating System type</li><li>Operating System version</li><li>Device Type</li><li>Language of the website</li><li>Web browser type</li><li>Email (in hashed form)</li></ul><p>  Mediavine Partners (companies listed below with whom Mediavine shares data) may also use this data to link to other end user information the partner has independently collected to deliver targeted advertisements. Mediavine Partners may also separately collect data about end users from other sources, such as advertising IDs or pixels, and link that data to data collected from Mediavine publishers in order to provide interest-based advertising across your online experience, including devices, browsers and apps. This data includes usage data, cookie information, device information, information about interactions between users and advertisements and websites, geolocation data, traffic data, and information about a visitor’s referral source to a particular website. Mediavine Partners may also create unique IDs to create audience segments, which are used to provide targeted advertising.</p></div> <p><p>  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices to opt-in or opt-out of this data collection, please visit <a href="https://thenai.org/opt-out/" target="_blank"> National Advertising Initiative opt out page </a>.

        Contact Us</h4><p>  
        We have asked our adverisers to not use pop-ups, pop-unders or interstitial pages, as we find them as 
        annoying as you do! Advertising, however, does provide the funding to keep WorldTimeServer.com up and 
        running for everyone.</p><p>
