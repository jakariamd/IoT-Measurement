<div><h1>  Content Guidelines</h1><p>  
       
        Titles sold through the Kindle Publishing Platform Program must follow our content policy and guidelines, detailed below. Publishers are expected to
        conduct proper research to ensure that the titles sold through the Kindle Publishing Platform Program are in compliance with all local, state,
        national, and international laws. If Amazon determines that the content of a title is prohibited, we may summarily remove or alter it without returning
        any fees. Amazon reserves the right to make judgments about whether or not content is appropriate.  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with
        some examples of prohibited content:
        
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Pornography</h2><p>  
        
        Pornography and hard-core material that depicts graphic sexual acts.
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Offensive Material</h2><p>  
        
        What we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect. Amazon reserves the right to determine the appropriateness of titles sold on our site.
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Illegal Items</h2><p>  
    
        Titles sold through the Kindle Publishing Platform Program must adhere to all applicable laws. Some titles that may not be sold include any titles
        which may lead to the production of an illegal item or illegal activity.
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Stolen Goods</h2><p>  
  
        If Amazon learns that a publisher does not have the right to license a title to us through the Kindle Publishing Platform Program, we will immediately
        remove the title from the Program.
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Items that Infringe Upon an Individual's Privacy</h2><p>  
    
        Amazon holds personal privacy in the highest regard. Therefore, titles that infringe upon, or have potential to infringe upon, an individual's privacy -
        or that portray an individual in a false light - are prohibited. Additionally, titles that are composed of marketing lists (bulk e-mail lists,
        direct-mail marketing lists, etc.) are prohibited.
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Recopied Media</h2><p>  
    
        Copies, dubs, duplicates of software, images, etc., are prohibited. Likewise, you cannot sell transferred media from the Internet to any digital
        format--unless explicitly approved by the author.
    </p></div> <div><h2>  Rights of Publicity</h2><p>  
    
        Celebrity images and/or celebrity names cannot be used for commercial purposes without permission of the celebrity or their management. This includes
        product endorsements and merchandise as well as unauthorized celebrity image collections.
