We have tried hard to put as little constraints on you as possible. The only thing we ask you to do is to comply with our <a href="/support/terms-of-use/" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  What is the default quota for API requests?</h3><p>  The default access all applications get is to our <strong> Public </strong> APIs with a quota of 2 requests/sec and 5000 req/day.</p></div> <div><h2>  Data</h2></div> <div><h3>  What datasets does the API cover?</h3><p>  The Ticketmaster API offers access to live events, attractions, venues and tickets! The datasets span all North American and International markets. Furthermore, the Ticketmaster API provides data coming from ticketing platforms like TicketWeb, Universe and Front Gate.</p></div> <div><h3>  What data formats does the Ticketmaster API support?</h3><p>  The Ticketmaster API supports the JSON format only at this time.</p></div> <div><h2>  Affiliates</h2></div> <div><h3>  Why should I join the Ticketmaster Affiliate Program?</h3><p>  With more than 150K events ticketed each year, Ticketmaster offers unparalleled access to live sports, concerts, theater productions and family events.</p><p>  If you are looking to build or enhance a user experience in the live event space, Ticketmaster’s superior content depth and technology solutions means greater choice for your users, as well as opportunity to monetize. Not to mention the Ticketmaster brand and our <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/verified" target="_blank"> Verified Tickets </a> promise makes us the most trusted, respected brand in live event ticketing. Our affiliate program plays a crucial part of Ticketmaster’s business strategy in finding new audiences for our clients, from industry leaders to small start-ups.</p></div> <div><h3>  Speaking of monetization, how do I earn money through the affiliate program?</h3><p>  The program compensates partners based on sales delivered (not traffic sent), both in primary and resale channels. Specific rates and terms can be discussed during the onboarding process, but Ticketmaster does not pay commission on primary tickets during the first 24 hours following a public onsale. The Ticketmaster cookie is valid for 30 days, and the TicketsNow cookie is valid for 60 days.</p></div> <div><h3>  Is the Ticketmaster affiliate program right for me? How do I join?</h3><p>  The affiliate program is best-suited for websites and apps that can deliver unique buyers to Ticketmaster’s clients, who are looking to drive incremental sales beyond what takes place on Ticketmaster or client websites. If you think you fit the mold, <a href="/partners/distribution-partners/affiliate-sign-up" target="_blank"> please fill out an application </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  How does the onboarding process work?</h3><p>  Ticketmaster will provide appropriate publishers an API key, or other content tools, to access the <a href="/products-and-docs/apis/discovery/" target="_blank"> Discovery API </a>. You will also need to separately create a publisher account through <a href="https://member.impactradius.com/bla/Ticketmasterdirect/login.user" target="_blank"> Impact Radius </a>, our third-party provider who manages our tracking, reporting and payments.</p><p>  Once you have an affiliate publisher ID, you will wrap destination URLs in an Impact Radius wrapper to ensure proper tracking, so that when you deliver a sale to Ticketmaster or Ticketsnow, you’ll be credited for the purchase. You will be able to receive reporting through the Impact Radius interface, as well as custom reports that can be sent on a daily basis.</p></div> <p><p>  Before signing up at Impact Radius, please <a href="mailto:devportalinquiry@ticketmaster.com" target="_blank"> reach out to us </a> about whether you’re appropriate for the program!</p></p> <div><h3>  What content and tools will be available to me?</h3><p>  Our Discovery API will provide access to events for sale on Ticketmaster.com and Ticketweb. We can also grant access to our resale API which has all events from our secondary market suite of sites including NFL Ticket Exchange, NHL Ticket Exchange, NBA Tickets Resale Marketplace, and TicketsNow.com, which can also be listed and monetized. Talk to your account manager if you are interested.</p></div> <div><h3>  But I’d like to actually sell tickets in my own shopping cart. Can I do that?</h3><p>  In most cases, no. Our program largely serves affiliates who can create unique content experiences that complement our clients’ aims and drive incremental traffic to Ticketmaster.com for conversion. Ticketmaster will grant access to our Partner Commerce API for a limited number of partners. <a href="/support/contact-us/" target="_blank"> Please contact us </a> if you have any questions.</p></div> <div><h3>  What markets does the Ticketmaster affiliate program serve?</h3><p>  The affiliate program is available in the following markets: Australia & New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Spain, Sweden, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, US & Canada.
