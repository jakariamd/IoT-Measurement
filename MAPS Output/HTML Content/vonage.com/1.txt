Your contact list is considered your personal data. We may use your contact list information to facilitate certain services where selected by you such as to enable you to make calls easily and to facilitate calls, texts, and other services. We may also facilitate the delivery of messages to individuals in your contact list that you wish to invite to download our mobile apps so that you can utilize our services with these selected individuals, although it is always your choice to send invites to such individuals. We will not use your contact list information for other purposes without first notifying you of the proposed use. You do not have to allow us to access your contact list information, but if you do not, certain features of our mobile apps may not be available to you. You may at any time opt out from allowing this access via the privacy settings on your device.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>Mobile device camera, microphone and photos.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>   If you use our mobile apps, we may request your permission to access the camera, microphone, and photos on your mobile device, to make and receive voice and video calls and messages and to send photos to others.

You may use the mobile app to do a one-time share of your precise geographic location through a message in a chat session by pressing the location attachment button within the mobile app (a “Location Share Event”). We will retain the Location Share Event within your chat session on the mobile app until you delete the message. Your precise geographic location, including a Location Share Event, is considered your personal data. To the extent our mobile apps collect precise geographic location, you may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your mobile device’s precise location information via the mobile app’s location settings on your mobile device. </span></span> <div><p>  Why we collect your information and how we use it</p><p>  How we use the information we collect depends on the nature of the data, which of our services you use, how you use them, and specific preferences you may have communicated to us. We reserve the right to collect,  share and otherwise use non-Personal Data for any purpose except where limited by applicable law, and to create non-Personal Data from Personal Data in order to do so.  We list below the specific purposes for which we collect, use and otherwise process your Personal Data:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To deliver our services.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We use your Personal Data and other information as necessary to perform our obligations in delivering our services to our customers. This includes delivering your communications to the intended end user, processing transactions with you (such as billing), authenticating you when you log into our platform, providing customer support, and operating and maintaining our services. We also need your information to communicate with you about the services, including registration confirmations, purchase confirmations, expiration or renewal reminders, responding to your requests, and sending you notices, updates, security alerts, administrative messages, and other communications necessary to usage of the services.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>To carry out core activities relating to our services.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>   To effectively deliver our services to you, we use your Personal Data and other information to engage in important supporting activities such as:</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>billing and collections, including maintenance of records in the event of a subsequent billing dispute;</li><li>preventing fraud, violations of our acceptable use policies, and unlawful activities; </li><li>troubleshooting, quality control, and analytics; and</li><li>monitoring the performance of our systems and platform.</li><li>For research and development</li></ul></ul> <span><span>  . We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services, to make them more reliable, secure, and useful to you and our users generally and we may use the Personal Data and other information we collect to help us do so. For instance, we use data regarding our users’ communications on our platform to understand how our services are performing and how they are being used in order to identify areas where we can do better. For instance, we may use message delivery and call connection information to gauge the effectiveness of our routing to ensure that your messages are delivered and your calls are connected. We and our service providers may use your information, including information obtained through customer surveys, to assess the level of interest in, and use of, our services, our communications to our customers, and our other messaging campaigns, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. Surveys are optional and customers can opt-out from receiving such surveys via opt out links in survey invitations.   We also use information about your use of our websites to understand how our website visitors are using our websites. Among other things, this usage information, along with tracking technologies, enables third-party analytics companies to generate analytics reports on the usage of our services. </span></span> <div><ul>  <li>To improve our services and develop new services</li></ul><span>  . We use your data in the provision of the services.  We also use data we collect in existing services to improve and develop new services. </span><ul>  <li>To market, promote, and drive engagement of our products and services</li></ul><span>  . We use Personal Data and other information about you to send promotional communications, such as e-mail messages, text messages, phone calls, faxes and postal mail, and for marketing when we have an adequate legal ground to do so. When prior opt-in consent is required by applicable laws, we will obtain such consent. We do not send marketing communication to our customers’ customers who are end users. Based on information we collect about you, we may decide whether and how to promote certain of our products or services to you over others. These communications are to drive your engagement and maximize the value of our services to you, and to help you receive more relevant information from us. To perform the above functions and others described in this Privacy Policy, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including Personal Data and usage information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as contact information, demographic information, and personal interest information. Where local law permits, an auto-dialer and/or artificial or pre-recorded message may be used to make calls to you.  Consent on behalf of someone else or provide someone else’s contact information will not be accepted. You are not required to agree to promotional communications in order to purchase goods or services from us. You can control whether you receive these kinds of communications as described below in Opt out of communications.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li>To comply with legal requirements.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>   Applicable laws or regulations may require our processing of your Personal Data and other information, such as laws mandating retention of communications data, including disclosures required by law or legal process. </span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights. </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  Where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights and interests, or the  interests of others, we use Personal Data and other information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business. </span></span> <p><p>  According to your explicit consent.</p></p> <span><span>   If we wish to use your Personal Data for certain purposes which require consent under applicable law, we will first seek out and obtain your consent. This may include, for example, testimonials or case studies that identify you in your individual capacity.</span></span> <div><p>  Who we share your information with and why</p><p>  We reserve the right to collect, share and otherwise disclose non-Personal Data for any purpose except where limited by applicable law, and to create non-Personal Data from Personal Data in order to do so. We may share your Personal Data and other information as detailed below:</p><ul>  <li>Third-party service providers that help us to deliver the services and allow us to operate our businesses.</li><li>Communications providers. </li></ul><span>  As the provider of a communications platform, we share the data we collect from you with communications providers (including traditional PSTN telecommunications companies and over-the-top communications service providers) as necessary in order to provide you with the services. These are the telecommunications companies, for instance, who we need to ensure your calls, messages and other communications reach the people you want to contact.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li>Payment gateways</li></ul><span>  : In the provision of conversational commerce services, we use payment gateways as necessary in order to provide you with the services. These are payment gateways companies that ensure the payment is completed in relation to conversational commerce services.</span><ul>  <li>Business operations vendors.</li></ul><span>   We work with third-parties to help us run our business, such as to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis, marketing and advertising, and other services for us, which may require them to access or use Personal Data and other information about you. We only work with carefully selected vendors, and take reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data that they process for us.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li>Partners</li></ul><span>  . In the event that you purchase services offered by Vonage or a partner through a special marketing arrangement (for example, through a co-branded advertisement or offer, or an arrangement where we and a partner market or offer the other’s products or services), we may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations. We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing. </span></div> <div><ul>  <li>Vonage events</li></ul><span>  . If you attend a Vonage event, we may also share any information that you have submitted to us with a third party business partner. We will always disclose to you the name of the business partner with whom we intend to share the information and obtain your prior opt-in consent to do so. </span><ul>  <li>Third party services. </li></ul><span>  Our services and websites may include links or other tools (e.g., plug-ins, “like” and share buttons, SDKs, etc.) that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit Personal Data or other information to any of those third parties, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any third party with which you interact.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Compliance with law enforcement requests and applicable laws; enforcement of our rights.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We may disclose Personal Data and other information as required by applicable law, regulation, legal process or government request; to protect Vonage, our services, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities; and to enforce our agreements, policies and service terms. If Vonage receives a civil or criminal subpoena, warrant, or other official and written request that is legally binding (“Request”) by a public authority for disclosure of personal data, Vonage will promptly notify the customer to the extent Vonage is not precluded from doing so by the Request. In the event that the information must be provided, Vonage will (a) ensure that the disclosed Personal Data is the minimum required to satisfy the Request; and (b) take all commercially reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is afforded confidential treatment by the authorities.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>With your explicit consent. </li></ul></ul> <span><span>  We share Personal Data and other information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display use cases or testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites and require your consent to identify you in your individual capacity. If you are a business customer, and have requested this, your business name and phone number may be included in public directories. </span></span> <div><ul>  <li>Sharing with senders and recipients of communications</li></ul><span>  . The name on your account, or a portion thereof, and/or your phone number may be displayed to people that you make calls to and to other users of the services so that they may contact you. Depending on the service you’re using, you may be able to control what’s displayed by adjusting your settings within the mobile app or your customer account, or by contacting customer care at the address provided when you signed up for the services.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Vonage affiliates; business transactions.</li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We share your Personal Data and other information with and among our corporate affiliates, for instance in order to operate and improve the services we provide to you; and we may share your information in connection with a sale, merger, financing, liquidation, or reorganization of our business or assets.</span></span> <ul><ul>  <li>Credit control. </li></ul></ul> <span><span>   When permitted by applicable laws, we obtain credit reports on new customers in order to evaluate customers for the risk of non-payment. In the event of non- or late payment, we may furnish your name, address and other details to credit bureaus and other consumer reporting agencies. They may include that information in preparing credit reports and use that information in calculating credit scores provided to their customers.  </span></span> <div><p>  How we protect your information</p><p>  Vonage has implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to help protect the Personal Data that we transmit and maintain.  Those measures are heightened for sensitive data such as Social Security numbers and payment account numbers. However, no system or service can provide a 100% guarantee of security, especially a service that relies upon the public internet. Therefore, you acknowledge the risk that third parties may gain unauthorized access to your Personal Data and other information. Keep your account password secret and please let us know immediately if you think your password was compromised. Remember, you are responsible for any activity under your account using your account password or other credentials.</p></div> <div><p>  Where we store your information and international transfers</p><p>  Personal information held by Vonage is stored on and processed on computers situated in the UK, the EEA, the United States, and in other jurisdictions. We and/or our service providers also process data in some other countries for customer care, account management and service provisioning.</p><p>  How long we store your information</p><p>  We store your information until it is no longer necessary to provide the services or otherwise relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. This time period may vary depending on the type of information and the services used, as detailed below. </p></div> <span><span>  After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. We may also retain aggregate, de-identified or anonymized information beyond this time for, among other uses, research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. We will take measures to prevent reidentification de-identified information retained or used for these purposes consistent with applicable law, and will not make efforts (or authorise others to make efforts) to re-identify it. </span></span> <div><ul>  <li>Customer account information</li></ul><span>  .
