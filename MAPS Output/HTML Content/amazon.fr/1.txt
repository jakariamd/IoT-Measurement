The largest household brands sell on Amazon. And so do emerging brands that will pop up on your radar soon.

VAT) per month + referral fees</div></div> <div><h2>  Before you start selling</h2></div> <div><h3>  Choose your plan</h3><div>  Amazon offers you the flexibility to sell one type of item or to sell thousands, through Individual or Professional plans respectively (think of them as standard or premium plans). Before you start registration, decide which plan best fits your business.The Individual plan costs €0.99 per item sold, while sellers using the Professional plan pay €39 per month, no matter how many items they sell. If you sell more than 40 items per month, the Professional plan makes more sense. Whichever plan you choose, don’t worry about making the wrong choice as you can change at any time. Note that, in both cases, additional referral fees apply to the flat rates.</div></div> <div><h3>  Plans</h3></div> <div><h3>  Individual</h3></div> <div><h3>  Professional</h3><div>  This plan might be right for you if:</div><ul>  <li>You sell fewer than 40 items a month</li><li>You don't need advanced selling tools or programmes</li><li>You’re still deciding what to sell</li><li>You sell more than 40 items a month</li><li>You want access to APIs and other selling reports</li><li>You want to sell with programmes like <a href="https://sell.amazon.fr/programmes/launchpad?ref_=sdfr_soa_beginners_lp" target="_blank"> Launchpad </a> or <a href="https://sell.amazon.fr/programmes/handmade?ref_=sdfr_soa_beginners_hm" target="_blank"> Handmade </a></li></ul></div> <div><h4>  Did you know:</h4></div> <div><h4>  Tools for brand owners</h4><div>  If you own a brand, <a href="https://sell.amazon.fr/proprietaires-de-marques.html?ref_=sdfr_soa_beginners_brands_dyk" target="_blank"> Amazon offers tools </a> to help you build, grow, and protect it.

Identity verification protects sellers and customers</li><li>Company registration details, including VAT number.</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  FAQs:</h4></div> <div><h4>  What is a VAT number and why do I need to get one?</h4><div>  If you sell goods in any EU country, it’s likely you may be required to register for Value Added Tax (VAT) in each country you sell in. VAT is a tax that VAT-registered traders in the EU add to the price of the goods they sell, and pass on to the national tax authorities when they file their tax returns. You may be able to claim back a portion of your VAT.</div></div> <div><h3>  How much does it cost to sell on amazon?</h3><div>  There are a few different types of referral fees you might pay, depending on your selling plan and the <a href="https://sell.amazon.fr/resources/produits-vente-enligne" target="_blank"> types of products </a> you sell.</div><div>  Subscription fees</div><div>  These are the fees you pay for your selling plan, and they vary depending on which plan you select.</div><ul>  <li>On the Professional selling plan there’s a flat fee of €39 per month and no per-item fees.</li><li>On the Individual selling plan, there’s a €0.99 fee for each item sold.</li></ul></div> <div><div>  Referral fees</div><div>  These fees are charged per item sold, and they include referral fees (which are a percentage of the selling price and vary depending on the product’s category), and variable closing fees (which apply only to media categories).</div><div>  Fulfilment fees</div><div>  When you fulfil orders yourself, Amazon shipping rates apply. We charge these shipping rates based on the product category and shipping service selected by the buyer.</div><div>  FBA Fees</div><div>  For products that Amazon fulfils for you (known as Fulfilment by Amazon, or FBA), there are fees for order fulfilment, storage, and optional services.</div></div> <div><h2>  Get to know Seller Central</h2></div> <div><h3>  What is Seller Central?</h3><div>  Once you register as an Amazon seller, you’ll have access to your Seller Central account. Think of Seller Central as your go-to resource for selling on Amazon. It’s a dashboard for managing your seller account, adding product information, updating inventory, managing payments, and finding useful content to help you grow your Amazon business. It’s also where you list all of your products.</div><div>  Below are a just few of the things you can do from Seller Central.</div></div> <div><ul>  <li>Keep track of your inventory and update your listings from the Inventory tab</li><li>Download custom business reports and bookmark templates that you often use</li><li>Use customer metrics tools to monitor your seller performance</li><li>Contact Seller Support and open help tickets using the Case Log</li><li>Keep track of your daily sales for all of the products you sell on Amazon</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  Use the mobile app</h3><div>  Use the Amazon Seller App to track sales, fulfil orders, find products to sell, respond to customer questions, capture and edit professional-quality product photos, and create listings from your phone.</div></div> <div><h2>  VAT compliance</h2></div> <div><h3>  Understanding your VAT requirements</h3><div>  Depending on the nature of your business, you will be required to register for VAT numbers in a European country as per the regulations. This depends on multiple factors, some of which are country of establishment, fulfilment model, and your annual sales. Understanding the various VAT requirements, and knowing how to comply with them, will contribute to a seamless selling experience on Amazon.</div></div> <div><h2>  How to list products</h2></div> <div><h3>  Listing your first product</h3><div>  To sell a product on Amazon, you must first create a product listing. Either match an existing listing (if somebody else is already selling the same product on Amazon), or create a new listing (if you are the first or only seller).The specific way sellers upload and list their products varies depending on their selling plan. To put it simply: sellers using a Professional seller account have the option of listing their products in large batches using bulk uploading or inventory management with third-party systems, while Individual sellers list products one at a time.</div></div> <div><h4>  Did you know:</h4></div> <div><h4>  Sell to both B2B and B2C customers with one account</h4><div>  Once you successfully list your product, it will become available to both B2C and B2B customers. This enables you to extend the scope of your offers from a single accountwithout any additional fees.</div></div> <div><h3>  What you need to start listing products</h3><div>  In most cases, products must have a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), such as a UPC, an ISBN, or an EAN. Amazon uses these product IDs to identify the exact item you’re selling. If you match a listing, you won’t need to provide a product ID since it already exists. If you’re adding a product that’s new to Amazon, you may need to purchase a UPC code or request an exemption.</div><div>  In addition to a product ID, here’s some of the important information that goes into each product listing:</div></div> <div><ul>  <li>SKU</li><li>Product title</li><li>Product description and bullet points</li><li>Product images</li><li>Search terms and relevant keywords</li></ul></div> <div><h5>  EXPLAINER</h5></div> <div><h4>  Understanding product IDs</h4></div> <div><h4>  Learn more about product IDs and how to request a GTIN exemption</h4><span>  Watch</span></div> <div><h4>  FAQs:</h4></div> <div><h4>  What are restricted product categories?</h4><div>  It's important that customers are able to shop with confidence on Amazon, which is why some product categories (like certain grocery or automotive products) are known as “restricted product categories”. Amazon might require performance checks, additional fees, and other qualifications in order for you to sell certain brands or list items within restricted categories. You’ll be able to request approval from within Seller Central.</div></div> <div><h3>  Successful listing = successful launch</h3><div>  Adopting best practices for adding listings can have a big impact on their success. Make it easy for shoppers to find your listings by adding descriptive titles, clear images, and concise feature bullets to your items. Avoid things that could negatively impact your launch:</div></div> <div><h4>  Variation issues</h4><div>  Products that vary only by colour, scent, or size might be a good candidate for listing as variations. Ask yourself if the customer would expect to find the products together on the same page. If not, list them separately.</div></div> <div><h4>  Image compliance</h4><div>  Your images must be at least 500 x 500 pixels (increase the size to 1000 x 1000 for high-quality listings) and set against a plain white background. The product should fill at least 80% of the image area.</div></div> <div><h4>  Product IDs</h4><div>  Make sure you’re meeting the requirements for product UPCs and GTINs (Global Trade Item Number). Consistency in these codes helps promote confidence in the range of products shown in the Amazon catalogue.</div></div> <div><h3>  Don't have an Amazon seller account yet?</h3><div>  €39 (excl. VAT) per month + referral fees</div></div> <div><h2>  The product detail page</h2><div>  A product detail page is where customers view a product sold on Amazon. If you’ve shopped on Amazon before, you’ll probably recognise the product detail page. It’s where customers can find all the relevant information about a particular item.When multiple sellers offer the same product, Amazon combines data from all the offers into one product detail page (so we can present customers with the best experience). You can propose product information on a product detail page, along with other sellers and manufacturers, and request detail page reviews if you don’t think that the information is correct.As you’re building your product detail pages, try to think about what will best help customers find your products, discover answers to their questions, and make a purchasing decision. Aim for the ultimate customer experience by making your listings concise, accurate, and easy to understand.</div></div> <div><div>  1.</div></div> <div><div>  Heading</div><div>  200 characters max., capitalise the first letter of every word</div><div>  2.</div><div>  Images</div><div>  500 x 500 or 1000 x 1000 pixels to improve listing quality</div><div>  3.</div><div>  Variations</div><div>  Such as different colours, scents, or sizes</div><div>  4.</div><div>  Bullet points</div><div>  Short, descriptive sentences highlighting key features and benefits</div><div>  5.</div><div>  Featured Listing ("Buy Box")</div><div>  The Featured Listing on a detail page.

Use Amazon’s translation services to translate your product offers and information.</div></div> <div><h2>  How to deliver products</h2></div> <div><h3>  Selecting the right fulfilment option</h3><div>  Amazon sellers have two options for delivering products to customers: you can either do it yourself, maintaining your own inventory and shipping products to customers (merchant-fulfilment), or have Amazon take responsibility for packaging, labelling, and shipping products through Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA). Each method has its own set of benefits; all you have to do is decide which one is right for your business.</div></div> <div><h3>  The benefits of Fulfilment by Amazon</h3><div>  Around the world, Amazon has more than 175 fulfilment centres providing over 150 million square feet of storage space. With Fulfilment by Amazon, you can store your goods on these shelves. You also get Amazon's global customer service and returns, as well as other benefits (like automatic Prime eligibility on your eligible products and free fast shipping) that allow you to scale your business quickly.</div></div> <div><h3>  Fulfilment Across Europe</h3><div>  Amazon offers a range of fulfilment solutions across Europe, so you can choose the one that best suits your business. Pan-European FBA is the fastest and most popular service: Amazon stores and distributes your products from fulfilment centres in the European Union. With the European Fulfilment Network, your products are shipped from a central storage facility in their country of origin. With Multi-Country Inventory, inventory is stored and shipped from fulfilment centres located in the specified countries.</div></div> <div><h4>  Did you know?</h4></div> <div><h4>  There are two types of FBA fee</h4><div>  There are two types of FBA fee: fulfilment fees (which are charged per unit sold and include picking and packing your orders, shipping and handling, customer service, and product returns), and inventory storage fees (which are charged monthly and are based on the volume of inventory being held in an Amazon fulfilment centre).</div></div> <div><h3>  How Fulfilment by Amazon works</h3></div> <div><h3>  Step 1</h3><div>  Ship your inventory to Amazon. It will be scanned and made available for sale.</div></div> <div><h3>  Step 2</h3><div>  With each order, Amazon packages and ships the product directly to the customer.</div></div> <div><h3>  Step 3</h3><div>  Amazon collects payment from the customer and pays you the funds available every two weeks.</div></div> <div><h3>  Step 4</h3><div>  Amazon’s customer service team handles any questions, returns, and refunds.</div></div> <div><h3>  If you’re fulfilling your own orders</h3><div>  Merchant-fulfilled simply means you store and ship products directly to customers yourself. Amazon charges shipping rates based on the product category and shipping service selected by the customer, then passes the amount on to you in the form of shipping credit.Set shipping rates apply to all products sold with an Individual plan, so it's important that you always price your items so that they are cost-effective for you. Amazon’s Buy Shipping tool can help you get a great deal on shipping labels with Amazon’s trusted network of shipping partners, to ship and confirm your orders, and track your shipments</div></div> <div><h3>  Don't have an Amazon seller account yet?</h3><div>  €39 (excl.

Make sure you’re familiar with the right and wrong way to get more product reviews and avoid policy violations.</div></div> <div><h4>  Amazon jargon:</h4></div> <div><h4>  Seller University</h4><div>  Seller University is an online resource from Amazon, with videos featuring step-by-step guides, tutorials, and training to help entrepreneurs start (and grow) their Amazon business.</div></div> <div><h3>  Don't have an Amazon seller account yet?</h3><div>  €39 (excl.
