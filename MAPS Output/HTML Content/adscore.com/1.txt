            </p></div> <div><p>  Adscore provides two types of services to its users:</p><ul>  <li>
                Traffic Verification Services, available through a variety of methods, in order to enable the users to
                verify the type and origin of their traffic (<strong> “Adscore Verification Services” </strong>) and
              </li><li>

              data concerned, what rights you have and how to get in touch with us if you need to.
            </p></p> <p><p>  
<strong> Please read the following carefully to understand our use of your personal data through our Services
                (as defined below). </strong>
</p></p> <div><h3>  Changes To This Policy</h3><p>  
              Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page. Please check back
              frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy. We reserve the right to update this
              Privacy Policy at any time.
            </p></div> <div><h2>  Who We Are</h2><p>  
              Adscore is a software company that works with Web Traffic Processors to help them identify fraudulent
              traffic they may be purchasing as part of the advertising ecosystem. To do this, Adscore collects and
              processes personal data on online users, through the Platform. Reducing fraudulent and invalid activity
              increases faith in digital advertising.
            </p><p>  
              Adscore’s disclosure of personal data is very limited, as we only temporarily process the data in order to
              compute statistics before discarding it. The duration during which we hold the data is 1 second, and
              further details can be obtained by consulting the section “Who we share personal data with”
            </p></div> <div><h3>  What Do You Mean By Personal Data?</h3><p>  
              “Personal Data” is defined as any data relating to a living individual who can be identified directly from
              that data or indirectly in conjunction with other information. It can take the form of a name or address
              and, now, under new data protection laws in Europe, this can extend to uniquely generated IDs, IP
              addresses and other “unique identifiers”.
            </p><p>  
              We cannot identify an online user by name, or find out where they live, but instead it gives us a picture
              of how a user interacts with an advertising campaign which we may be monitoring in order to detect
              fraudulent or invalid traffic.
            </p></div> <div><h2>  
              Personal Data We Collect And How & Why We Collect It

              Why We Collect Personal Data And Our Lawful Basis For Processing
            </h3><p>  
              Adscore collects information, including personal data, in order to identify and prevent fraud online
              (including in respect of online advertising and ecommerce). We also use such information for our internal
              operations (including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing and statistical purposes). We do not use any
              personal data other than as necessary to execute our Services.
            </p></div> <p><p>  
              Adscore does not collect, retain, or share any personally identifiable information ("PII")
              (including unique user identifiers and IP addresses) gathered on sites or apps not owned by Adscore
              ("Third Party Provided PII"), except for the purpose of providing our fraud detection and
              prevention related services and never to create user profiles. We only share Third Party Provided PII with
              customers receiving our fraud detection and prevention services, or as otherwise directed by the
              applicable customer and services providers if necessary to provide the fraud detection and prevention
              services to our customers. We never share Third Party Provided PII collected on one customer’s site with
              other customers. Retention of Third Party Provided PII is determined by the applicable customers.
            </p></p> <p><p>  
              EU Privacy law requires us to have a “lawful basis” for collecting and using processing data. We collect
              this information for our legitimate interests. These are two fold (a) our legitimate interest, and our
              client’s legitimate interest, in preventing fraud; and (b) our legitimate interest in managing client
              relationships and the ongoing improvement of our Services.
