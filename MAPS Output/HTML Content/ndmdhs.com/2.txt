(For the avoidance of doubt, SONY does not process any of the Collected Data to provide the minimum functions of the Application for operating it. These activities happen on the Installed Device´s operating system. For this, no Collected Data is transferred to SONY.) </p></div> <div><h4>  (i) Pushing updates to your Application or Related Device</h4><p>  Each time you start the Application on your Installed Device, the Application sends a “request” to SONY´s server to check whether any updates for the Application or the firmware of the Related Device are available and to send latest software or firmware in case any update should be available. For this, we only process your IP address.</p></div> <div><h4>  (ii) Providing “Help” upon your request</h4><p>  If Help is requested by you, certain technical information about the Installed Device, about the Application and about the Related Device are transferred to SONY in order to provide the Help. This transfer of data enables SONY providing you with “customized” Help webpages for the Application and the specific technical issue you experience. For this, we process the following of your Collected Data:</p><ul>  <li>Information about the Installed Device and component parts thereof: Language code, Country, Region, IP address, Time zone.</li><li>Information about the Application: Application ID, Application version (incl.

Product improvement and/or development includes those relating to either an improvement of the technical functions of the Related Device or the usability of such product for user´s convenience. Such product improvement/development is only done on a “general” level, not on an individual user level, so specific users are not targeted. This includes, through analysing logfiles of the app usage, </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>complementing our app with new useful functions if we determine malfunctions or other technical issues (e.g. new function to fix connectivity issues); or </li><li>change of default or other settings respectively accentuating specific settings/functions or respectively ceasing certain functions, in any case to add value to your user experience. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  SONY´s affiliates may access and use the Collected Data to improve and develop SONY’s current and future products and services as well, however only in an aggregated/anonymized, i.e. non-personal manner.</p></p> <p><p>  In this case, we process the Collected Data because you have given us your consent.</p></p> <p><p>  You can withdraw your consent above at any time by selecting "(3 dots) Menu" > "About this app" > "Privacy settings" in the Application.</p></p> <div><h2>  4.
