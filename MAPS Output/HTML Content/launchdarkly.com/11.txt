<div><h2>  Privacy for Showcasing Work</h2></div> <div><h3>  Use Private Pens as Drafts</h3><p>  
Pens are public by default on CodePen, and all public Pens are indexed
for public search, findable on your profile, and <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/legal/licensing/" target="_blank"> open source licensed. </a>
</p><p>  
Private Pens are none of those things. No one can see them unless you
decide to share them. They aren’t shown in search, either through
CodePen search or outside search engines. They can’t be seen on
your profile. No license is applied to them.
</p></div> <p><p>  
One way to use Private Pens is to keep all your Pens private while you
are working on them, then toggle them over to Public when you are ready.
</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Any Pen can be Private</li><li>Any Project can be Private</li><li>Any Collection can be Private</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  No Annoying Passwords</h3><p>  
Nobody can guess a URL like the URLs to your private work on CodePen.
They are totally unfindable until you share that URL.
That’s pretty handy because anybody who you share that URL with
can see it. They don’t have to be logged in, have a password, or
even have an account.
</p></div> <div><h2>  Private Collections</h2></div> <div><h3>  Send Private Collections to Clients</h3><p>  
 One popular reason to make Private Pens on CodePen is for in-progress
concepts for client work. You can make Private Collections on CodePen,
and you can put Private Pens in Private Collections. We’ve had
lots of people tell us this is perfect for working with clients. You
send them a link to the Private Collection and they can see everything
related to a project in one place.
</p></div> <div><h3>  How Private is Private?</h3><p>  This is how private content works on CodePen:</p><ul>  <li>
Private content gets an unguessable URL. Seriously. The
URL’s are so long and so obscure that even a computer
can’t guess them.
</li><li>
Private content is not findable through public CodePen search.
While logged in, you can still search <em> your own </em> content to
find your own private content, however.
</li><li>
We tell third-party search engines not to index private content.
We use every method they share for telling search engines like
Google and Yahoo to not index private content. They
shouldn’t be able to find links to your private content
anyway, but this is just in case you share it and these search
engines find those shared links.
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>
Private content is not findable on CodePen except by you on your
your own profile while logged in. Nobody else can browse around
CodePen and find anything private that you’d made. Not on
your profile or anywhere else.
</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  What privacy <em> isn’t </em> on CodePen:</p><ul>  <li>There are no passwords involved.</li><li>There is no user authentication involved.</li></ul><p>  
This isn’t enterprise-level mega-encrypted super-security.
It’s very secret URL’s for your content that are
unfindable until you choose to share them. Simple and effective!
</p></div> <div><h2>  Privacy for Teams</h2></div> <div><h3>  Team Members Can Work Together Privately</h3><p>  
People who are on the same <a href="/features/teams" target="_blank"> Team </a> can work
on private content together. As long as you are logged in and in the
Team Context, you can see all the Team’s private content right on
the Team Profile.
</p><p>  
For example, Rachel could start a Private Pen. Tim could update it. Alex
could add a title and explanation. Marie could add it to a Private
Collection. In the Team Context, everybody has access to all the Team
content, private or otherwise.
