Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising</h3><p>  a. Analytics</p><p>  We may use third-party web analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These vendors use the sort of technology described in the “Information we collect automatically” section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these vendors, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"> Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  b. Tailored Advertising</p></p> <p><p>  We may also allow third-party advertising technologies to place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (a) inform, optimize, and serve marketing content based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (b) report how our marketing content impressions and interactions with these marketing impressions are related to visits to our websites. We also allow other unaffiliated parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics) to serve tailored marketing to you and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may disclose to a vendor in hashed, non-human-readable form.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing, you may visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative's (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Link </a>, the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank"> Digital Advertising Alliance's (“DAA”) Consumer Opt-Out Link </a>, and/or the <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu" target="_blank"> European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance </a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank"> Google Ads Settings page </a>. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content may not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out pages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. </p></p> <div><h3>  5.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.</p></p> <p><p>  b. Additional rights of residents of the European Economic Area and United Kingdom</p></p> <p><p>  LaunchDarkly is considered the “data controller” of the personal data we handle under this Privacy Policy. In other words, LaunchDarkly is responsible for deciding how to collect, use and disclose this data, subject to applicable law. The laws of some jurisdictions such as the laws of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom require data controllers to tell you about the legal ground that they rely on for using or disclosing of your information. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Contractual Commitments: We may use or disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to you. For example, we will process your personal data to comply with our agreements with you, and to honor our commitments in any contracts that we have with you.</li><li>With Your Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use or disclose information on the basis of your consent.</li><li>Legitimate Interests: In many cases, we use or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, certain promotional activities, analyzing and improving our business, providing security for the Services, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Legal Compliance: We need to use and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition to those rights described herein, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.</p></p> <p><p>  c.
