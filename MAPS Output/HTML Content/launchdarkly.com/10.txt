For our treatment of the Personal Information of students under the age of 16 (each such student, a “Student,” and collectively, “Students”) collected while providing the Services to public schools, charter schools, private schools, and other entities providing educational or tutoring services (collectively, “Schools” and each individually, “School”) providing such services to Students, please see Section X below and our <em> Schools & </em><em> Students Privacy Policy Addendum </em></p></p> <p><p>  Wistia does not collect Personal Information indiscriminately. We limit the type of Personal Information and the amount of Personal Information to what is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy. With that in mind, we collect the following types of information:</p></p> <p><p>  We may collect Personal Information from you when you visit any of our Websites, register for or subscribe to any Media or Services, contact us with questions or concerns, and/or otherwise interact with the Websites, Media, or Services. For example, when you register for our Services, we may collect your name, phone number, user name, and e-mail address in combination with a password or security question to access the Services, and your payment information. Similarly, you may provide information to your user profile or upload video, audio recordings, images, or other content to a Website. Where Users or Customers provide video, audio recordings, images, or other Personal Information of one or more individuals, we rely on that User or Customer to obtain the explicit consent of those individuals. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, although that may affect the functionality of the Services. </p></p> <p><p>  Whenever you interact with any of our Websites or Media, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including data related to Media viewing, listening to, or accessing (including when you stop and start Media, how many and which Media of a particular Customer you watched, and how many times you watched, listened to, or accessed particular Media), data related to use of Services, IP address, device, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. </p></p> <p><p>  An “IP address” is a number assigned to a computer by an Internet service provider “ISP” to access the Internet. In most consumer cases, an IP address is dynamic (changing each time connect to the Internet), not static (unique to a particular user’s computer).</p></p> <p><p>  “Cookies” are small text files we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and make our website work more efficiently, as well as tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and used and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to send “do not track” signals or to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website’s features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p></p> <p><p>  We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may communicate with you about your use of any of the Websites. When we do this, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. </p></p> <p><p>  If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by visiting our email preference page. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Websites, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p></p> <p><p>  Wistia may purchase from third parties, like Clearbit, Personal Information about Users who provide their email address or register for the Services, using the Personal Information those Users provide as the basis to obtain further Personal Information. This information may include names, titles, companies, and firmographic information. Wistia may retain YouTube API Services to provide aggregate, statistical information about the access to, views of, and use of Media that Customers post to YouTube. Personal Information generated automatically by your access to, views of, and use of Media may be aggregated and included in that statistical information.</p></p> <p><p>  Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not knowingly collect Special Categories of Personal Information, including (1) Personal Information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and (2) genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, and data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation. </p></p> <p><p>  Where we collect and use such information as a controller (as defined in the GDPR), we will provide you with a form explaining the collection of such Personal Information and requesting your explicit consent. Where we collect and use such information as a processor (as defined in the GDPR), we rely on the controller to obtain your explicit consent.</p></p> <p><p>   Wistia may collect Sensitive Personal Information, as defined under the CPRA and PIPEDA, in the form of your financial information, messages sent via the Services, and your geographic location. </p></p> <p><p>  Wistia has collected the following categories of Personal Information in the 12 months immediately preceding the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, listed at the bottom of this document: names; contact information; payment information; IP addresses; geographic location (inferred from IP addresses, as described in Section III below); browser information; device information; information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services; email confirmations; user name or e-mail address in combination with a password that would permit access to the Services; the content of communications; user profile information and submissions; job titles; employers; and firmographic information. Please see the other portions of Section II above for an explanation of the categories of sources from which we collect the information described in the previous sentence. The business purposes of this information are described in Section III below. The categories of third parties we share this information with are described in Section IV. </p></p> <p><p>  Wistia uses all categories of Personal Information listed above for any and all legal and legitimate businesses purposes, including:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To personalize and improve our Services, to administer and improve our Media and Websites;</li><li>To allow Users to set up their user accounts and profiles;</li><li>To communicate with Users and fulfill your requests for certain products and services;</li><li>To understand how Users utilize the Websites; Media, and Services</li><li>To protect user accounts with user names or e-mail addresses in combination with passwords; </li><li>To process payments to Wistia; </li><li>To infer your geographic location;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To operate, maintain, develop, and grow Wistia.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  At times, we may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. For example, if you have provided your email address or other Personal Information while accessing Media, we may anonymize that Personal Information when providing Media usage information to our partners.</p></p> <p><p>  When we collect IP addresses, geographic location, browser information, device information, information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services, we may also use such information in two ways. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>First, we may use such information in aggregate form (including the aggregate statistical information obtained from YouTube API Services), and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate information tells us how often Users use parts of a Website, so that we can make such Website appealing to as many Users as possible. </li><li>We may also provide this aggregate information (including the aggregate statistical information obtained from YouTube API Services) to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Websites, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience. In addition, we may also provide Customers with the information listed above so that they may (i) assess, improve, and develop the Media that they make available through the Websites and Services, and (ii) use their Media to maintain and grow their organizations. Such information may include how many and which Media of a particular Customer was watched by a particular user, from where particular Media was watched, listened to, or accessed by a particular user and how many times particular Media was watched, listened to, or accessed by a particular user.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We store and process all electronic Personal Information that we collect in the United States.</p></p> <p><p>  We share your Personal Information with third parties as described below.</p></p> <p><p>  As mentioned above, we may provide Customers with certain identifiable usage information directly related to the Media that such Customers make available through the Websites and Services. Such information may include IP addresses, geographic location, browser information, device information, and information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services (such as how many and which Media of a particular Customer was watched by a particular user, from where particular Media was watched, listened to, or accessed by a particular user and how many times particular Media was watched, listened to, or accessed by a particular user). We may also share names, contact information, geographic location, the content of communications, user profile information and submissions, job titles, employers, and firmographic information which Customers may use to market or further develop their organizations.</p></p> <p><p>  In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through a website (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to enter into such transaction or to receive such service, please review the applicable third party websites’ policies.</p></p> <p><p>  We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share your Personal Information with them to provide products or services to you, for example, processing credit card payments. Unless we tell you differently, our agents and service providers do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We acknowledge our potential liability if our agents misuse your Personal Information. </p></p> <p><p>  Some Customers post Media to YouTube. If you use, view, listen to, or otherwise access such Media on YouTube, YouTube will have access to Personal Information you generate by using, viewing, listening, or accessing that Media, which is then used by YouTube API Services to generate the aggregated statistical information Wistia collects from YouTube API Services, as described in Section II.D of this Privacy Policy. YouTube’s use of Personal Information is governed by the Google Privacy Policy, available at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank"> http://www.google.com/policies/privacy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Certain user profile information, including, without limitation, a user’s name, location, and any video, audio recordings, images or other content that such user has uploaded to a Website, may be displayed to other Users to facilitate user interaction within such Website or to address your request for Wistia’s services. Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, forums, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload video, audio recordings, images, or other content through the Website and other users can contact you through messages and comments.</p></p> <p><p>  If and to the extent that Wistia transfers Personal Information from another country into the United States, Wistia does so in compliance with the Privacy Laws of the originating country.</p></p> <p><p>  We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, Personal Information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p></p> <p><p>  Wistia will disclose any Personal Information that Wistia reasonably believes is necessary or appropriate to comply with law or court order, enforce or apply Wistia’s Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of Wistia, our employees, our customers, our users, the public, or others. This includes disclosing Personal Information to third parties for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p></p> <p><p>  Except as set forth above, we will obtain your consent before disclosing your Personal Information to a third party.</p></p> <p><p>  The CCPA (as amended by the CPRA) defines the sale of Personal Information very broadly. In the traditional sense, Wistia does not sell Personal Information, however we disclose certain Personal Information to our Customers as part of the Services and the hosting of Media we provide to them. As part of our commercial relationships with our Customers, Wistia has disclosed the following categories of Personal Information to Customers in the 12 months immediately preceding the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, listed at the bottom of this document: names; contact information; IP addresses; geographic location; browser information; device information; information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services; the content of communications; user profile information and submissions; job titles; employers; and firmographic information.</p></p> <p><p>  In the 12 months immediately preceding the Effective Date of this Privacy Policy, listed at the bottom of this document, Wistia has disclosed the following categories of Personal Information to third parties that provide business and operational services to us: names; contact information; payment card information; geographic location; IP addresses; browser information; device information; information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services; email confirmations; user name or e-mail address in combination with a password that would permit access to the Services; the content of communications; user profile information and submissions; job titles; employers; and firmographic information.</p></p> <p><p>  As relevant, Wistia collects and uses your Personal Information (1) pursuant to your informed consent, which you have granted by confirming the prompts produced by the Websites and by continuing to use the Websites, Media, and Services, consistent with the Privacy Policy and Wistia’s terms of use, (2) in order to pursue Wistia’s legitimate business interests in hosting the Media, providing the Services, and maintaining the Websites, and/or (3) in order to perform a contract to which you are a party. Any one or more of the bases in the previous sentence are the legal basis for Wistia’s collection and use of your Personal Information, depending on how your use of the Websites, Media, and Services, and your relationship with Wistia. </p></p> <p><p>  Where individuals appear in Media, Wistia relies on the Media creators to obtain the necessary legal basis for the collection and use of those individuals’ Personal Information.</p></p> <p><p>  Except upon the request of an individual, as explained in Section VII below, and except as the law permits and requires, Wistia maintains Personal Information as follows:</p></p> <p><p>  A. Logs of unknown users of the Websites are retained for 30 days before deletion. </p></p> <p><p>  B. Logs of known users of the Websites are retained while Wistia has reason to believe that particular user may return to use the Websites.</p></p> <p><p>  C. Emails submitted and used for marketing are retained while Wistia pursues relevant marketing efforts.</p></p> <p><p>  D. Media is hosted and stored for the life of the relevant Customer account, plus up to three years.</p></p> <p><p>  Other than as listed above, we will determine the retention period for Personal Information based on the following criteria:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The nature of our relationship with the relevant Customer;</li><li>The existence of other ongoing or expected projects with the relevant Customer;</li><li>The nature of the Personal Information in question; and</li><li>Our business needs.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Except where permitted or required by Privacy Laws, you have the following rights regarding Wistia’s collection and use of your Personal Information.</p></p> <div><p>  You may request the following from Wistia with respect to your Personal Information: </p><ul>  <li>The correction and updating of your Personal Information;</li><li>The restriction and deletion of select portions of your Personal Information or all Personal Information;</li><li>The categories of Personal Information Wistia has collected about you; </li><li>The categories of sources from which Wistia has collected your Personal Information;</li><li>The expected period for which the Personal Information will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine the retention period;</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>The business or commercial purpose(s) for collecting, sharing, and disclosing your Personal Information; </li><li>An account of how Wistia has used or is using your Personal Information; </li><li>A copy of your Personal Information retained by Wistia, to be delivered in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format to review or to transfer or transmit to another entity without hindrance, to the extent that that is technically feasible; </li><li>The categories of third parties with whom Wistia shares your Personal Information; </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The categories of your Personal Information that we have shared with third parties, including customers, and the categories of third parties to which we have shared each particular category of Personal Information; </li><li>The Personal Information Wistia collects, uses, discloses, and sells;</li><li>A list of all third parties that have received your Personal Information from Wistia; and </li><li>The specific pieces of Personal Information Wistia has collected about you. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you request that your Personal Information be erased or deleted or that Wistia otherwise restrict its collection and use of Personal Information, Wistia may not being to avoid terminating or limiting your access to the Websites, Media, and Services. </p></p> <p><p>  If Wistia has not collected or used your Personal Information, or has not disclosed your Personal Information to another party, Wistia will inform you of that in response to any of the above requests. </p></p> <p><p>  Some information may remain in Wistia’s backup media after erasure or deletion for a period of time. When you request that Wistia update information, Wistia may retain a copy of the unrevised information in Wistia’s records. Wistia also may use any anonymized aggregated statistical data derived from or incorporating Personal Information after it is updated, erased, or deleted, but not in a manner that would identify you.</p></p> <p><p>  We will confirm receipt of all such Personal Information requests and provide information about how Wistia will process the request within 10 days of receipt. We will substantively respond to all such requests within 30 days, subject to lawful extension of that period, and there may be a delay in processing a request while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party. </p></p> <p><p>  Our verification process varies based on the source and nature of the request, but may include: comparing data in the request against Personal Information we retain; contacting you using other contact information; requesting further information, although we will avoid doing so to the extent possible; and the consideration of certain factors, including the type, sensitivity, and value of your Personal Information, the risk of harm to you posed by an unauthorized request, the likelihood that fraudulent or malicious actors would seek your Personal Information, the manner in which we interact with you, the available technology, and whether the information you have provided to verify your identity is sufficiently robust to protect against fraudulent requests. To the extent permitted by the Privacy Laws, Wistia retains the right to deny any request if we cannot verify that it originated from you.</p></p> <p><p>  Wistia retains records of all of the above requests and our responses for 24 months, unless otherwise prohibited by the Privacy Laws.</p></p> <p><p>  With regard to the right to be forgotten online, Wistia will take reasonable steps to inform our Third Parties of your request.

Please see Section VIII for an explanation of Wistia’s service differences.</p></p> <p><p>  Wistia does not offer any financial incentives for providing your Personal Information. However, there are some service differences when users create an account and provide the necessary Personal Information to do so.</p></p> <p><p>  Although much Media and parts of the Services may be used and accessed without providing your Personal Information, other Media, portions of Media, and parts of the Services require users to create and log in to a Wistia account. In doing so, you will provide us with a user name or e-mail address and a password. In return we will permit access to Media and Services that are not viewable or accessible to anonymous users. By creating and logging into an account, you will provide your name and contact information, in addition to your username or email and password combination. Per the terms of this Privacy Policy, you will also permit Wistia to automatically collect, use, and share IP addresses, browser information, device information, and information related to the use of the Websites, Media, and Services. Wistia will also collect, use, and share any information you voluntarily provide in your communications to us, your user profile, and other user-generated submissions and content, consistent with the terms of this Privacy Policy. </p></p> <p><p>  Consistent with the CCPA, this service difference represents Wistia’s good-faith calculation of how one individual’s Personal Information increases the value of the data we provide to Customers, on average.
