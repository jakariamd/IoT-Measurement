However, please be aware that we may have the right to continue to process your information if it can be justified on one of the other legal bases mentioned above.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You have the right to object to how we process your personal data, or ask us to restrict the processing. Please see ‘Your rights’ below, for more details.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Who may access your personal data? </li></ul><p>  <strong> Your personal data on Trustpilot </strong>
We share your reviews on our platform so that others can read about your experience with a specific business. When you write a review, other users of our platform will be able to see your username, your location (country), all reviews you’ve written (including the locations and products you’ve reviewed, and your product photos or videos), and other information you have chosen to connect with your public profile. They can also see whether you’ve marked other reviews as “useful”.</p></div> <p><p>  Remember that if you’ve selected to use your real name as your username, this could reveal your identity. We recommend you exercise care in deciding which information to make available on our platform, and be aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may or may not be anonymous.</p></p> <p><p>  If you connect to a social network, information such as your profile photo, your name, birth year and approximate location will be collected from your social network profile and used to identify you on our platform. Subject to your privacy settings and the level of information available from the social network, users of our platform can use this information to identify the reviews you have written.</p></p> <p><p>  If you’ve chosen to preserve anonymity by not using your name for your Trustpilot username, be aware that information from social networks can reveal your identity in part or in full and make it possible to identify which reviews you have written.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Your personal data on Trustpilot when you create a business account on behalf of your company </strong>
When you create a business account on behalf of your company, we will disclose your company name, company address, domain, country and other information you have chosen to connect with your company’s public profile.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We recommend you exercise care in deciding which information to make available for disclosing on the website and be aware that depending on the level of information provided, you may or may not disclose personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  Other information provided by you on the website, including your replies to users’ reviews about your company, are also made available for other users of the website.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Your personal data shared with other services, websites and businesses </strong>
One of Trustpilot's main goals is to increase the exposure and availability of reviews. We therefore permit other services to show reviews created on our platform, including but not limited to, companies’ replies to reviews created on the website. This increases the potential audience and other consumers’ knowledge of Trustpilot and the reviews.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  The categories of third-party services and companies that can show your reviews together with your public user profile (or if you have a business account on Trustpilot, your replies to reviews about your company) are:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Search engines, including Google and Bing.</li><li>Businesses you reviewed on Trustpilot.</li><li>Businesses that invited you to review a product.</li><li>Consumer portals and business portals, including price comparison websites, shopping guides, etc.</li><li>Application partners and platforms, such as Prestashop, Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce.</li><li>Other similar websites where, in Trustpilot’s assessment, it will be relevant for users to search for reviews.</li><li>Social networks.</li><li>If you write a review on Trustpilot in response to an invitation sent by a business via our review invitation services, that business will be able to match your review with their invitation.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We won’t share documentation you send us to verify your experience with the reviewed business. However, if you have a reference number, order ID or similar, we may pass that on to the business, unless you ask us not to. If you choose to provide information when replying to a message sent by a reviewed business using the <a href="https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012251668--How-to-find-information-about-reviewers" target="_blank"> Find Reviewer tool </a>, this information will also be shared with the reviewed business.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Your personal data shared with data processors </strong>
We share your personal data with selected third parties (including Trustpilot subsidiaries and other companies within the Trustpilot group, and companies we work with to provide our services) that provide us with a variety of different services that support the technical operation of our platform and the delivery of our services ("data processors"). These third parties are data processors for the personal data for which we are the data controller. We have data processing agreements in place with the data processors, and it follows from these agreements that they must act solely in accordance with our instructions. By accepting this policy, you authorize us to instruct the data processors to process data in accordance with this policy and for the purposes of using the platform.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We carry out checks to ensure that data processors have taken reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect against the information being accidentally or illegally destroyed, becoming lost or deteriorating, and to protect against the information being disclosed to unauthorized persons, being misused, or in other ways being processed in violation of data protection laws.</p></p> <p><p>  Some of these data processors and third-party services will be located in countries outside of the one in which you are based and may have different, or less stringent, data protection standards. However, subject to the local laws in these countries, we will ensure that necessary safeguards are in place to protect your data, regardless of location. We do this through a combination of appropriate technical, organizational and administrative security measures, and by putting in place the necessary legal contracts to back up these requirements. For example, we will only transfer European users’ personal data outside the European Economic Area where a European Commission-approved method of validating the transfer has been put in place.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Other disclosures </strong>
In addition to the above, we share your personal data with the following parties and in the following circumstances:</li><li>To comply with laws or to respond to claims, legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas and court orders) and requests from public and government authorities.</li><li>To cooperate with regulatory bodies and government authorities in connection with investigations or case referrals.</li><li>To third parties in connection with the enforcement of our <a href="/for-reviewers/end-user-terms-and-conditions" target="_blank"> User Terms & Conditions </a>, <a href="/for-reviewers/guidelines-for-reviewers" target="_blank"> Guidelines for Reviewers </a>, <a href="/for-businesses/terms-of-use-and-sale-for-businesses" target="_blank"> Business Terms & Conditions </a>, and <a href="/for-businesses/guidelines-for-businesses" target="_blank"> Guidelines for Businesses </a>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To third parties in order for us to protect our operations or those of our affiliates.</li><li>To third parties to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others.</li><li>To third parties in order for us to pursue available remedies, or limit damages that we may sustain.</li><li>To third parties in order for us to investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to fraud and misuse of our platform.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To third parties in the event of any reorganization, merger, acquisition, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business or assets (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li><li>How long do we store your personal data?</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We only keep your data for as long as we need it, or are required to for legal reasons. This depends on why it was collected, and if we have a continuing legal basis to do so (such as to fulfil a contract between us, perform a service you requested, meet legal requirements, or for our legitimate interests). When we no longer have a valid reason to keep your data, we'll either delete it or anonymize it so that it doesn't identify you. We treat data differently depending on what it's used for, but you can delete your personal data or ask us to do that for you at any time (see ‘Your rights’ below).</p></p> <p><p>  Personal data you provide, including your reviews, is kept for as long as you have a Trustpilot account, or as needed to provide you with our services. If you choose to delete your user account, we will save a log with the following information: your name, email address and the date of the deletion of your account. We will keep the log for three years. In some cases, even if you delete your Trustpilot account, we retain certain information we are required by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include (but are not limited to) security, fraud and platform abuse prevention, complying with legal or regulatory requirements, and defending our legitimate business interests.</p></p> <p><p>  Personal data we receive from companies that use our automated services to send a review invitation to you on their behalf is kept for three years.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>How do we keep your personal data secure?</li></ul><p>  Keeping your personal data secure is our highest priority. We use various organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect your personal data within our organization and we regularly audit our system for vulnerabilities. However, since the internet is not a completely secure environment, we can’t ensure or warrant the security of the information you transmit to us. Emails sent via the platform may not be encrypted, and we therefore advise you not to include any confidential information in your emails to us.</p></div> <p><p>  We’re always working to improve <a href="https://support.trustpilot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000721308--Our-security-practices" target="_blank"> our security practices and policies </a>, and we will update this information as these practices evolve over time.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Do we use cookies?</li></ul><p>  We use cookies and similar technologies to help deliver, optimize, personalize and analyze our services, and for advertising purposes.</p><p>  We use a combination of cookies and other technologies, such as pixels and tracking codes, to collect information for use in line with the purposes set out in this policy.</p><ul>  <li><strong> What’s a cookie? </strong>
