Browser cookies allow websites and various third parties to distinguish your device from others by having the cookie consist of a unique identifier or other data.  Cookies can have many uses, such as to target advertising as well as to enable website functionality and for security.  We use both session cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. (Each browser is different, so check the "help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Hubbell products or services that require you to "sign in", and some areas of our Website may not work properly, and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings.  You can <a href="#" target="_blank"> adjust your cookie preferences by clicking here </a>.  Essential and functional cookies cannot be disabled.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Flash Cookies </b>:  Local shared objects (such as "Flash" cookies) are associated with non-Browser software like Flash Player. Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls.  You can visit Adobe.com for guidance on how to delete and block Flash cookies.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Web Beacons & Pixels </b>:  Web beacons and Pixels are electronic image files that are used by third-party advertisers, analytics companies, and others to collect information about how users interact with content. This technology is embedded in web pages you visit and cause your browser to share its IP address with the third-party source of the beacon, together with any cookies associated with that third-party.  They allow us to count visitors to our webpages, evaluate the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or recommend relevant products and services to you when you browse social media or other Websites.  Blocking cookies will not stop your IP address from being shared through the use of beacons.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Online Interest-Based Ads </b>:  We may use online "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information from their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our Website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> E-tags </b>:  E-tags are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance. E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others.  Typically, e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted.  You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Mobile Applications </b>:  Software in our mobile and other connected-device applications collects information about how you interact with the digital services.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> How We Use Your Information </strong></p><p>  We may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:</p><ul>  <li>Provide, operate, develop, improve, maintain, and protect our Websites, applications, products, services and content</li><li>Customize your digital experience</li><li>Personalize digital content</li><li>Deliver marketing communications and advertising.</li><li>Confirm, track, and fulfill orders for products or services</li><li>Communicate with you regarding your requests</li><li>Process refunds, returns, and exchanges</li><li>Conduct market research and analysis of usage trends</li><li>Prevent and identify fraud and other illegal activity</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations (including our contractual obligations with you, such as Hubbell’s Terms of Use and this privacy Policy), relevant industry standards, and our policies</li><li>Enforce our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and other rules about your use of the Websites and mobile applications</li><li>Protect Hubbell Incorporated’s rights or property and/or the rights of others</li><li>Comply with laws or regulations, court orders or other legal process</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> How We Protect Information </strong></p><p>  We maintain technical and organizational safeguards designed and intended to protect Personal Information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. Despite these safeguards, due to inherent uncertainty in the use of the internet and information systems and the potential for unlawful attacks by third parties, we cannot guarantee that the use of our systems, websites or applications will be completely safe or secure.  Personal Information we collect and use may be transferred, stored and accessed globally to support our operations. We retain Personal Information for as long as it is needed or useful to provide and improve our products and services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> How We May Share Information </strong></p><p>  We may share your Personal Information with unaffiliated entities (companies outside Hubbell) with your proper implied or express consent in the following instances:</p><p>  <b> To Conduct Business with Service Providers and Other Partners </b>:  We may disclose your Personal Information to companies that provide various services to us in areas, such as installation, repair, warranty, order processing and fulfillment, information technology, marketing, customer service, data analytics, research and enhancement, fraud prevention, legal, compliance and risk management. These companies may need access to Personal Information about you in order to perform their functions but are generally not authorized to use the Personal Information we disclose to them for any other purpose.  In limited cases, we may disclose Personal Information about you to a third party who may also use the Personal Information for their own specific purposes. For instance, we may provide your information to a partner who is jointly providing or promoting a product or service to you or with a social media or online advertising company to serve tailored commercial information to you.</p></div> <p><p>  <b> To Comply with Law Enforcement or Court Order </b>:  We may disclose Personal Information about you (1) if we believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; (2) as we deem appropriate or necessary in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities or tax authorities; (3) when we believe disclosure is appropriate or necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Hubbell, our customers or others, including to prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury or loss or to collect debt you owe; or (4) in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> To Sell, Transfer or Reorganize Our Business </b>:  We reserve the right to transfer Personal Information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including, without limitation, in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Your Choices & Preferences </strong></p><p>  <b> Website Account </b>:  When you register for an account on our Website, you are asked for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, email address, and a username and password that you select.

The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.  As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our Website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser.  If you block browser cookies, some parts of our Website may not function correctly.  Also, blocking cookies will not stop third parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Website Analytics Services </b>:  We use certain analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to gather information about our Website visits or mobile application usage.

The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do-not-track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Protecting Children’s Privacy </strong></p><p>  This website is not intentionally designed for or directed at children under 13 years of age.
