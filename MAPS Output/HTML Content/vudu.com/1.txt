                further information on these companies).</p></p> <p><p>  The laws of some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, the UK, or Brazil, require companies to tell you about the legal basis for using, sharing, or disclosing your information. To
                the extent those laws apply, we may rely on the following legal bases:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Performance of a contract:  </strong>where use of your information is necessary to provide you with the Services under a contract, for example the terms of service.</li><li><strong> Legitimate interest:  </strong>where use of your information is necessary for our or others’ legitimate interests and where the use is not outweighed by your rights and
                    interests. Below are some examples of such interests:
                    </li><li>providing the Services</li><li>improving the Services and developing new ones</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>recognizing and better understanding our users, including across platforms</li><li>conducting security and fraud prevention activities</li><li>marketing and promoting our content and services</li><li>building and managing business-to-business relationships</li><li>conducting compliance and risk management activities </li><li>providing and managing access to our systems
</li><li><strong> Legal obligation:  </strong>where use of your information is necessary to comply with laws and regulations such as those relating to anti-bribery and corruption and
                    anti-money-laundering, complying with requests from government bodies or courts, or responding to litigation.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> With consent:  </strong>we may ask for your consent to process your information in a certain way. Where we rely on this basis, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
                    any time – please see the <a href="#your-rights" target="_blank"> Your Rights </a> and <a href="#your-choices" target="_blank"> Your Choices </a> sections below to do this.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  How Long We Keep Your Information</h3><p>  We will keep your information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described above, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. In determining how long to retain information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests. The purposes for which we process information (as well as the other factors listed above) may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information. For example, we retain your email address as an authentication credential (where applicable) as long as you have an account with us and an additional period of time after that for our legitimate interests and for our fraud and legal compliance purposes. If you opt out of email marketing, we maintain your email on our suppression list for an extended time to comply with your request.</p></div> <p><p>  We may delete or de-identify your information sooner if we receive a verifiable deletion request, subject to exemptions under applicable law. The retention period that applies to your information may vary depending on the Services you use and how you interact with them. In addition, in the event you have an account that holds credits, point balances or other entitlements, we may continue to hold the account to allow you to obtain the benefit in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.</p></p> <div><h2>  4. CHILDREN</h2><p>  The Services are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, and thus if you are under 13 we ask that you do not use the Services or provide us with any information. If we
                discover that we have inadvertently gathered any such information then we will, to the extent required by law, delete such information from our records. There is one exception to this:
                when children's content is viewed within the Vudu service, the <a href="/policies/vudu-child-policy" target="_blank"> Vudu Children's Privacy Policy </a> shall apply. If a parent or guardian becomes aware
                that his or her child under 13 has provided us with information without his or her consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@fandango.com" target="_blank"> privacy@fandango.com </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  If we knowingly collect personal information on a child-directed service or from a user we have actual knowledge is a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably
                necessary to 1) fulfill the request or allow the child to participate in the activity, 2) ensure the security of our users and our online services, and/or 3) as required by law.  If we
                learn we have collected personal information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either delete that personal information or seek parental consent.</p></p> <div><h2>  5. YOUR RIGHTS </h2><p>  Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your information. You have the right not to be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for
                exercising your rights under some local laws such as in California. </p><p>  For example, under local laws, including in the European Union, you may be able to ask us to:</p><ul>  <li>provide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible</li><li>update or correct your information</li><li>delete certain information</li><li>restrict the use of your information</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We will respond within the time period prescribed by applicable law. Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations. You have the right not to be
                discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising your rights under some local laws such as in California.</p></p> <p><p>  Some Services can be provided only if we have your information, therefore deletion of your information will result in termination of such Services.</p></p> <p><p>  We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, including authenticating you through an email address. We may require further documentation such as a password and user ID before
                granting access to your information.</p></p> <div><p>  You may submit the following types of requests as follows:</p><ul>  <li> Request Categories of Information: If you, or someone acting on your behalf, would like to request that we tell you the categories of personal

Such residents may also opt out of the sharing or processing of their personal information for targeted advertising.
                    </li><li>We provide third parties such as advertisers and advertising networks (including social media networks) information including identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers [contact information], geolocation information, such as city; and inference data in order to enable marketing to you and delivery of targeted advertising on the Services or other sites.  Advertising, including targeted advertising, enables Fandango to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.  The disclosure of such personal information listed above to these third parties to assist us in providing these services may be considered a “sale” of personal information under applicable law and is sharing of personal information and the processing of personal information for targeted advertising purposes.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of Fandango's use or disclosure of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so in the footer or settings menu of the brand with which you engage by selecting “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link.</p></p> <p><p>  You may still receive advertising, including personalized ads based on Fandango data on the Services.  On some of our websites and applications when you click the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link in the website footer or in the application settings menu, you will be shown a tool that allows you to opt out of the online “sales” and sharing/processing of personal information for targeted ads on the website and application.  Please note, if you use different browsers, devices, or services you will need to make your elections separately. In some cases, you may also be presented with form fields to complete, in those cases we ask for your email address or other information so we may add it to an appropriate suppression list. In other cases, you will be directed to this page where we provide additional information and options for you to learn more about your choices and how to opt out from interest-based advertising more broadly.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note, if we do not detect that you are in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah or Virginia, the opt out of sale or sharing/processing for targeted advertising data choices will not apply even if you take the actions described above.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that if you have a legally-recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on via your device browser (such as Global Privacy Control), we recognize such preference in accordance with and to the extent required by applicable law.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Sensitive Data </strong></p><p>  We may use certain sensitive personal information as allowable by law for purposes including analytics and to enable marketing to you and the delivery of targeted advertising on the Services or other sites, such as displaying an ad relevant to your precise location data.</p><ul>  <li>You can change your precise geolocation permissions for our mobile apps in your mobile device settings.</li></ul><p>  Additional Rights for California Residents: Residents of the State of California may request a list of all third parties to which the Services have disclosed certain personal
                information (as defined by California law) during the preceding year for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please
                contact us at Fandango, Attn: Privacy Officer, 407 N. Maple Dr., Suite 300, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. For all requests, you must put the statement “Your California Privacy
                Rights” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. In the body of your request, please provide enough information for us to determine if this
                applies to you. You need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept
                requests via the telephone, email, or by facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p></div> <div><h2>  6. YOUR CHOICES</h2></div> <div><h3>  Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3><p>  We and our service providers, advertisers, and other third parties use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., HTTP cookies, HTML 5, flash local storage cookies, web beacons, GIFs,
                embedded scripts, ETags/cache browsers, hashed identifiers and software development kits) to recognize you on, off, and across the Services and your devices. For more information about
                the use of cookies and similar technologies on the Services (including your opt-out choices) please see our <a href="/policies/cookies-and-tracking" target="_blank"> Cookies Notice </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  Mobile App and Connected Devices</h3><p>  Depending on the device you use, you may be able to manage your advertising and location preferences through your device settings and as outlined in our <a href="/policies/cookies-and-tracking" target="_blank"> Cookies Notice </a>. Many operating systems provide their own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application
                advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to manage personalized in-application advertisements. You should review your device manufacturer’s
                support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems for more detail on how to manage such preferences.</p></div> <p><p>  You may opt out of location data collection on our mobile app(s) by managing your location preferences in the “My Account” section of that app, or by disabling the GPS
                services for that app on your mobile device. To adjust access to location data, go to the settings menu on your mobile device and adjust the location configurations for the Fandango app.</p></p> <p><p>  You can stop all collection of information by a mobile app by uninstalling the app.</p></p> <div><h3>  Third-Party Online Services</h3><p>  The Services may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as voice controls) of third party platforms or contain links to third party services. These other platforms (such as
                gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, and set top boxes) and sites (even if co-branded as Fandango) may collect information about you and use this information in accordance with their
                own privacy policies and terms of service. We do not control those third parties’ policies or practices. Where Fandango collects personal information on a co-branded website or service, we will
                provide a link to our privacy policy as appropriate. In some circumstances, we may host some websites on behalf of others and those entities may place or permit the placement of cookies and other
                tracking technology.  We are not responsible for these tracking practices.</p></div> <div><h3>  Google Maps</h3><p>  If you use Google Maps / Google Earth as part of the Services, you agree to comply with the Google Maps / Google Earth Additional Terms of Service (including the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank"> Google Privacy Policy </a>). Further, you agree that Google, and not Fandango, shall be responsible for any of your
                information Google receives as a result of your use of Google Maps / Google Earth.</p></div> <div><h2>  7. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p>  We maintain organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to help protect the information we collect and use. These safeguards vary depending upon a variety of factors including
                the sensitivity of the information we collect and use. Despite all reasonable practices, no security method is infallible.</p></div> <div><h2>  8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </h2><p>  Fandango is a global company and has its headquarters in the United States. We may transfer your information to those described in this Privacy Policy outside of your country of
                residence, including in the United States and other countries. This is necessary to provide the Services and for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Data privacy laws vary
                from country to country and they may not be equivalent to, or as protective as, the laws in your home country. We take steps to ensure that reasonable safeguards are in place with an
                aim to ensure an appropriate level of protection for your information, in accordance with applicable law. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer,
                storage or use.</p></div> <div><h2>  9. UPDATES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2><p>  We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes to our practices or the law. We will make the revised Privacy Policy accessible through the Services.
                Please check the Services periodically for updates.</p><p>  The date at the top of this Privacy Policy tells you when it was last updated. If we make material changes to the way we collect or use your information, you will be provided with
                appropriate notice, including, but not limited to, by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this website, and providing notice in accordance with legal requirements. Any changes to
                this Privacy Policy will become effective when the revised Privacy Policy is posted. By continuing to use the Services following any changes to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge you
                have read and understand the updated Privacy Policy, and you understand that we will collect, use, and share information as stated therein.</p></div> <div><h2>  10.

APPLE APPTRACKINGTRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK FAQ</h2><p>  If you use Fandango applications on an Apple device, you may notice some changes both in the app store and in the consents available. In an effort to provide clarity, we have offered
                some additional information below.</p><ul>  <li><strong> How do the categories in the Apple menu compare with your Privacy Policy? </strong>
</li><li>The Apple menu reflects categories of information collected through our Apple app while our Privacy Policy covers information collected through both Apple and non-Apple app products and services.</li><li>Apple provided pre-defined categories that cannot be changed or clarified within the app store. Our <strong> Privacy
                            Policy </strong> provides a more detailed overview of the categories of data we collect with examples to help you understand more about our services. </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>There are some differences in Apple’s categories and the categories in our Privacy Policy. For example:
                            </li><li>We use the category “transactional” to describe credit cards and other information that may be collected during a purchase as well as your purchase history and Apple
                                    uses the term “financial” to describe credit cards and “purchase history” to cover other information related to your purchase. </li><li>We use the term “connection and usage” to describe data collected from your browsing history, search term history, and other interactions with our applications (such as
                                    clicking on a news story) while Apple uses “browsing history”, “search history” and “usage data” respectively. 

</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> The Apple store says my information is linked. What does that mean? </strong>
</li><li>Depending on the app you are using, we or our partners may link data collected on your application to your account, device, or identity for a variety of purposes. For example, we and our partners may link information in order to:
                            </li><li>Personalize your experience by tailoring viewing and content recommendations to you;</li><li>Identifying you when you log-into our services so we can remember where you left off on a movie or tv show you were viewing;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Customize advertising or marketing messaging; or</li><li>As otherwise described in our <strong> Privacy Policy </strong>.

</li><li><strong> The Apple store says my information is being used to track me. What does that mean? </strong>
</li><li>Depending on the app you use, we may use information collected from that app (including user or device data) together with data collected from other apps, websites and properties we
                            do not own to tailor advertising on our app, inform you of our products and services outside of the app, and measure those activities using third parties. This helps us to continue to
                            provide you with the high-quality content that you love to watch and read as well as offers that are more relevant to you.
                        
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> If I do not consent to ‘tracking’ on an Apple device what happens? </strong>
</li><li>Apple’s tracking consent restricts Fandango from linking data collected from that app with third-party data for targeted advertising or advertising measurement. If you do not
                            consent within a specific Fandango Apple app, you may still receive tailored advertising or content recommendations from us, including targeted ads or recommendations based on the
                            data that we collect from you directly elsewhere, including data collected across other Fandango (or its co-owners’ NBCUniversal and Warner Bros.) applications, websites and
                            platforms or based on data collected directly by our co-owners NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. In addition, your choice does not affect the data collected prior to the launch of
                            Apple’s Tracking Transparency framework. For more recently collected data, we will apply your most recent tracking choice to all the applicable data collected since the launch of
                            the framework. For more information about your choices around data collection generally, please see the <a href="#your-rights" target="_blank"> Your Rights </a> and
