Internet users to notify businesses of their privacy preferences, such as
whether or not they want their personal information to be sold or shared. It
consists of a setting or extension in the user’s browser or mobile device and
acts as a mechanism that websites can use to indicate they support the
specification.</p></div> <div><h3>  Who is supporting the development of GPC?</h3><p>  GPC is being developed by a broad coalition of stakeholders:
technologists, web publishers, technology companies,
browser vendors, extension developers, academics, and
civil rights organizations.</p></div> <div><h3>  I’m a web user. How can I use GPC to signal my privacy preferences to websites?</h3><p>  GPC is available for an increasing number of browsers and browser extensions,
listed <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#download" target="_blank"> here </a>. If you want to use
GPC, you can download and enable it via a participating browser or browser
extension. More information about downloading GPC is available
<a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  I’m a publisher, developer, or other service. How can I support GPC?</h3><p>  The GPC spec is easy to implement on a wide variety of websites and other
services. The proposed specification and back-end implementation reference
documentation are available <a href="https://global-privacy-control.glitch.me/" target="_blank"> here </a>.
For additional information, please feel free to reach out on Github or Twitter
(<a href="https://twitter.com/globalprivctrl" target="_blank"> @globablprivctrl </a>).</p></div> <div><h3>  I’m a policymaker. How can I support GPC or learn more about how it could apply in my jurisdiction?</h3><p>  As it is intended to invoke users’ privacy rights, we encourage policymakers
from around the world to engage in the development of this specification. If you
would like to learn more about how GPC could work in your jurisdiction, please
contact us via email at
<a href="mailto:info%5Bat%5Dglobalprivacycontrol.org" target="_blank"> info[at]globalprivacycontrol.org </a>.</p></div> <div><h3>  How can I get involved in developing the proposed specification?</h3><p>  GPC was initially introduced at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://privacycg.github.io/" target="_blank"> Privacy
Community Group </a> (Privacy CG) in April 2020. A
number of stakeholders are part of that community. There are ongoing
discussions in the Privacy CG. Interested parties are encouraged to engage with
the proposal <a href="https://github.com/privacycg/proposals/issues/10/" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  Additionally, GPC is currently being implemented across the web. A number of
browsers, extensions, and publishers are supporting or implementing GPC (see
below).</p></p> <div><h1>  Get Involved</h1><p>  Contact us to learn more about supporting  in your browser, app, or website.</p><p>  This site is hosted by <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank"> GitHub </a> and is subject to its <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service" target="_blank"> Terms of Service </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  Content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
