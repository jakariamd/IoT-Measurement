</li><li><strong> Information from partners:  </strong>We collect information from other companies with whom you have a relationship (“Partners”). These Partners might include (depending on what services you use): your TV or internet service

</li><li>online and offline information providers to support our ad supported subscription plans;
                            
</li><li>publicly-available sources such as publicly available posts on social media platforms and information available through public databases associating IP addresses with internet service providers (ISPs);

</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  Use of Information
            </h3><p>  We use information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and select ads in connection with our ad supported subscription plans, to process your
                registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. For example, we use such information to:</p><ul>  <li>provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies, TV shows, and games we think will be of interest to you (collectively “content”);
</li><li>determine your general geographic location (such as your city, state/province, and postal code); 
</li><li>provide localized content;
</li><li>determine your ISP to support network troubleshooting for you (we also use aggregated ISP information for operational and business purposes);
</li><li>help us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests;
                    
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>coordinate with Partners on making the Netflix service available to members and providing information to non members about the availability of the Netflix service, based on the specific relationship you have with the Partner;
                    
</li><li>secure our systems, prevent fraud and help us protect the security of Netflix accounts;
</li><li>prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to enforce our terms (such as determining whether and for which Netflix signup offers you are eligible and determining whether a particular
                        device is permitted to use the account consistent with our Terms of Use); 
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences and service performance) and optimize content or ad selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery;
                    
</li><li>communicate with you concerning our service so that we can send you news about Netflix, details about new features and content available on Netflix, special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys, and to assist you with
                        operational requests such as password reset requests. These communications may be by various methods, such as email, push notifications, text message, online messaging channels, and matched identifier communications (described
                        below). Please see the "Your Choices" section of this Privacy Statement to learn how to set or change your communications preferences.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Our content recommendations system strives to predict what you will be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, our content recommendations system does not infer or attach socio-demographic information (like gender or race) to you. We
                have a Help article that explains how our content recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver of these recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at <a href="http://netflix.com/recommendations" target="_blank"> netflix.com/recommendations </a>.
            </p></p> <div><h3>  Disclosure of Information
            </h3><p>  We disclose your information for certain purposes and to third parties, as described below:
            </p><ul>  <li><strong> The Netflix family of companies:  </strong>We share your information among the Netflix family of companies (<a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo" target="_blank"> help.netflix.com/legal/corpinfo </a>) as needed for: providing you
                        with access to our services; providing customer support; making decisions about service improvements; content development; and for other purposes described in the Use of Information section of this Privacy Statement.
                    
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Service Providers: </strong> We use other companies, agents or contractors ("Service Providers") to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you. For example, we engage Service
                        Providers to provide marketing, advertising, communications, security, infrastructure and IT services, to customize, personalize and optimize our service, to provide bank account or balance information, to process credit card transactions
                        or other payment methods, to provide customer service, to analyze and enhance information (including information about users' interactions with our service), and to process and administer consumer surveys. We engage Ad Service
                        Providers in the context of our ad supported subscription plans. In the course of providing such services, these Service Providers may have access to your personal or other information. We do not authorize them to use or disclose
                        your personal information except in connection with providing their services (which includes maintaining and improving their services).
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Partners: </strong> As described above, you may have a relationship with one or more of our Partners, in which case we may share certain information with them in order to coordinate with them on providing the Netflix service
                        to members and providing information about the availability of the Netflix service. For example, depending on what Partner services you use, we may share information:
                    
</li><li>in order to facilitate Partner pre-paid promotions or collection of payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us;
                            
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>with Partners who operate voice assistant platforms that allow you to interact with our service using voice commands;
                            
</li><li>so that content and features available in the Netflix service can be suggested to you in the Partner’s user interface. For members, these suggestions are part of the Netflix service and may include customized and personalized
                                viewing recommendations. 

</li><li><strong> Advertisers/Ad Measurement Companies:  </strong>We may share information collected from or about you with Advertisers and/or Ad Measurement Companies to select advertisements, and measure and improve advertising effectiveness.
                        As a reminder, please see the Information from Other Sources section above if you have questions regarding the role of Advertisers or Ad Measurement Companies.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Promotional offers: </strong> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for your participation, will require us to share your information with third parties. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share
                        your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive. Please note that these third parties are responsible for their own privacy practices.
</li><li><strong> Protection of Netflix and others: </strong> Netflix and its Service Providers may disclose and otherwise use your personal and other information where we or they reasonably believe such disclosure is needed to (a) satisfy any
                        applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal
                        activities (including payment fraud), security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public, as required or permitted by law.
                    
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Business transfers: </strong> In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party
                        agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Statement.
                    
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to other countries, we will ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the applicable laws on data
                protection. You can find out more about how we disclose and transfer your personal information internationally at this link: <a href="http://help.netflix.com/legal/personal-information-international-transfers" target="_blank"> help.netflix.com/legal/personal-information-international-transfers </a>.
            </p></p> <div><p>  You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:
            </p><ul>  <li>certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email, text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart device;
                    
</li><li>social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information; and
</li><li>through Netflix game features, such as multiplayer options and leaderboards.
                    
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some of the Netflix game features mentioned above (such as multiplayer gameplay,
                leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.
            </p></p> <div><h3>  Access to Account and Profiles
            </h3><ul>  <li><strong> “Remember me” function: </strong> For ease of access to your account, you can use the "Remember me on this device" function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct
                        account access and to help administer the Netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or other user identification when your browser revisits the service. 
</li><li><strong> Giving others access to your account: </strong> If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to your account, they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email address
                        or other information in the "Account" area of our website), and game related information (such as your in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have the
                        option to use seamless account login through the Netflix mobile app, which enables login to the Netflix app on smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the network to which you are connected. If you use that
                        feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices.
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Profiles: </strong> Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are available
                        to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if you do not wish
                        them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be provided with notice of collection
                        and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies (<a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy" target="_blank"> help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy </a>)). We have various parental controls available,
                        you can learn more by reading our Help article located at <a href="https://help.netflix.com/node/264" target="_blank"> help.netflix.com/node/264 </a>. 
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Profile Transfers: </strong> The profile transfer feature on your account allows you and users with access to your account to transfer an eligible profile from your account to a separate account (including information such as
                        viewing history and recommendations). You can change the setting for this feature in the Settings section of your Account page. You can learn more by reading our Help article located at <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/122698" target="_blank"> help.netflix.com/node/122698 </a>.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Removing device access to your Netflix account: </strong> To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices, visit the "Account" section of our website, choose "Sign out of all devices," and follow
                        the instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately). Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or Netflix
                        ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your
                        account, including your personal information.
</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  Your Choices
            </h3><p>  <strong> Email and Text Messages. </strong> If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email or text message, simply access the "Communications Settings" option in the "Account" section of our website
                and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Alternatively, click the "unsubscribe" link in the email or reply STOP (or as otherwise instructed) to the text message. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related correspondence
                from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.
            </p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Push Notifications. </strong> You can choose to receive mobile push notifications from Netflix. On some device operating systems, you will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you subsequently decide you no longer wish
                to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them off. We also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and subsequently decide
                you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings to turn them off. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix. </strong> Some third party sites and apps allow us to reach our users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the third party.
                A privacy protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares the privacy protective identifier
                to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given
                promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the “Marketing Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website.
                </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Behavioral Advertising.  </strong>Behavioral advertisements are those that are selected based on your use and/or interactions with various unaffiliated third party apps or websites across the Internet (behavioral advertising). Netflix
                can advertise its services using behavioral advertising, and if you are using a browser, then certain cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your likely interests. If you are using a mobile device,
                tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable device identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about behavioral ads from Netflix, please see the "Cookies
                and Internet Advertising" section (below).
            </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Netflix Ad Supported Subscription Plan - Behavioral Advertising. </strong> If you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, we can present you with advertisements, including ones selected using behavioral advertising information.
                If you do not wish to be presented with behavioral advertisements as part of your participation in an ad supported subscription plan, you can opt out by:</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>selecting the appropriate profile; and 
</li><li>choosing the "Behavioral Advertising" section in the "Account" section of our website
</li></ul><p>  When you choose to opt out of receiving behavioral ads, you will still see ads, but they will not be selected using behavioral advertising information. Opting out will not limit our collection of information, but will influence how we use
                such information. </p><p>  An option to opt out will not be provided in a Kids profile, because we do not engage in behavioral advertising on Kids profiles.</p></div> <p><p>  To exercise choice around cookies or resettable device IDs being collected or for any purposes outside of behavioral advertising in our ad supported subscription plan, please utilize the tools in the Cookies and Internet Advertising section
                below.</p></p> <div><h3>  Cookies and Internet Advertising
</h3><p>  We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains
                the types of technologies we use, what they do and your choices regarding their use.
            </p><p>  <strong> Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers </strong>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other
                technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work
                in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may
                collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for
                Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant
                and for analytics and optimization purposes. </p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Why does Netflix use these technologies? </strong></p><p>  We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to enforce our terms, prevent fraud;
                to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site; and to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites. We may

For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use
                        our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.
                    
</li><li><strong> Performance and functionality cookies: </strong> These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter
                        information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our
                        visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.
                    
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers: </strong> These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  When we advertise our services on other websites or apps, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively
                “Advertising Partners”), may receive information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information). Common uses of this type of information
                are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service. Another common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals
                to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user. Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs
                you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service. </p></p> <p><p>  In connection with our ad supported subscription plans, Netflix, our Ad Service Providers, and Ad Measurement Companies can use these technologies to operate and support our ad supported subscription plans, including supporting an Advertiser’s
                ad campaigns, measurement, and optimization of the same. </p></p> <div><p>  <strong> How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?

                connected devices, or if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan, ads displayed may allow you to interact with them through clicking them. These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy or data policies,
                privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service.

Because of differences in certain state laws, this supplement is broken
                into two sections, California (CCPA) Specific Notices, applicable to California residents only, and a California (CCPA) and other State Specific Sections, that may apply to residents of one or more states with consumer privacy laws requiring
                such information. Such states as of the date of this Privacy Notice are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia (collectively “US State Privacy Laws”).</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> California (CCPA) Specific Notices  </strong></p><p>  Personal Information We Collect</p><p>  We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household (“CCPA personal information”). We
                collect the following categories of CCPA personal information from consumers:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Identifiers </strong>: “Identifiers” covers a broad range of information, including things like name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and IP address. We collect some CCPA personal information that falls into
                        this category. For example, for streaming subscribers we’re going to have an email address, payment information (like a credit card), and for DVD customers we’re going to have a postal address. We collect IP addresses, identifiers
                        from the devices you might use to connect, and characteristics about the networks you use when you connect to our service online (see also “Information we collect automatically” above in the Privacy Statement). These sorts of identifiers
                        are connected to your Netflix account. There are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (resettable device identifiers, third party advertising cookies on our website) that we do not associate with your account,
                        but that can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications. In addition, there are identifiers (that may or may not be associated with your account) that we use for managing an ad supported subscription
                        plan. We will also collect information such as gender, if you join an ad supported subscription plan. 
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law </strong>: This covers a broad range of information like race, sex, marital status, among other protected classes. We will collect this sort of information
                        about you if you choose to participate in our optional research surveys, or other research activity such as an in person interview or panel. We do not collect this information when you register for the Netflix service. This will
                        include date of birth and gender if you join an ad supported subscription plan.
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Commercial information </strong>: This includes information about products or services considered, obtained or purchased.
</li><li><strong> Internet or other electronic network activity information </strong>: We offer online services, so we collect CCPA personal information in this category, like your interactions with our service.
</li><li><strong> Geolocation data </strong>: Our online services don’t collect precise geolocation data from GPS sensors. However, we do collect IP addresses from which we can determine your general location (such as your city, state/province,
                        and postal code).
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar information </strong>: We may collect photos, audio and/or video of you in certain circumstances. For example if you contact customer service, we may record the call (voice
                        recording). 
</li><li><strong> Inferences </strong>: We have a content recommendations system that strives to predict what you’ll be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, we do not have a list in our recommendations system that attaches socio-demographic
                        information to you like “soccer dad who likes rom coms” or “financially savvy mom who craves action films” or “singleton high school grad who likes tiny houses.” We have a Help article that explains how our recommendations system
                        works - spoilers: the biggest driver is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You can read the article at <a href="http://netflix.com/recommendations" target="_blank"> netflix.com/recommendations </a>.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Over the previous twelve months, we have collected each of the categories of CCPA personal information described above except the specific pieces of CCPA personal information collected in connection with an ad supported subscription plan (which
                has been available for less than twelve months as of the last update of this Privacy Notice).</p></p> <div><p>  Uses of CCPA personal information</p><p>  We use each of the categories of CCPA personal information listed above for the purposes noted below. (Please see the Use of Information section of our Privacy Statement for additional details that may be of interest to you.) For ease of reference,
                we repeat those sections below:</p><p>  We use personal information to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts, to provide, analyze, administer, enhance and select ads in connection with our ad supported subscription plans, to process

For example, we use such information to: </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>provide you with customized and personalized viewing recommendations for movies, TV shows, and games we think will be of interest to you (collectively “content”);
</li><li>determine your general geographic location (such as your city, state/province, and postal code); 
</li><li>provide localized content;

</li><li>prevent, detect and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, including fraud, and to enforce our terms (such as determining whether and for which Netflix signup offers you are eligible and determining whether a particular
                        device is permitted to use the account consistent with our Terms of Use); 
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>analyze and understand our audience, improve our service (including our user interface experiences) and optimize content selection, recommendation algorithms and delivery;

(Please see the Disclosure of Information section of our Privacy Statement for additional details that may be of interest to you.)</p><ul>  <li><strong> Identifiers </strong>: We may disclose identifiers for business purposes with the following categories of third parties: Service Providers, Partners, an entity engaged in a business transfer, law enforcement, courts, governments
                        and regulatory agencies. In the context of an ad supported subscription plan, certain identifiers may be shared with our Ad Service Providers, Ad Measurement Companies and Advertisers.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Over the previous twelve months, we disclosed each of the categories of CCPA personal information listed above for the business purposes as described in this Privacy Notice and our Privacy Statement. Please note that the specific pieces of
                personal information currently being disclosed for consumers using an ad supported subscription plan were not disclosed during the last twelve months, as this plan has been available for less than twelve months as of the last update of
                this Privacy Notice. </p></p> <div><p>  Sources of CCPA personal information</p><p>  We explain our sources of information in the Collection of Information section of our Privacy Statement. (Please see that section for more information that may be of interest to you.) For ease of reference, in regard to CCPA personal information
                these are:</p><ul>  <li>You (the consumer) when you provide us CCPA personal information directly, and when we collect it automatically based on your interactions with us (for example, through your computer or other Netflix capable device you might use to
                        access our service (such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices); 
</li><li>Partners (other companies with whom you have a relationship). These Partners might include (depending on what services you use): your TV or Internet service provider, or other streaming media device providers who make our service available
                        on their device; mobile phone carriers or other companies who provide services to you and collect payment for the Netflix service for distribution to us; voice assistant platform providers who enable interaction with our service
                        via voice commands; third party services that you are signed into that provide functions within Netflix games, such as multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options; and 
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Other sources. Service Providers who support our business including: security and payment service providers; Ad Service Providers, Ad Measurement Companies, and Advertisers; publicly-available sources, specifically, public posts on
                        social media platforms; and information about Internet Service Providers (ISPs) used by members to access Netflix through public databases associating IP addresses with ISPs. 
</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  CCPA Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</p><p>  As of the date of this Privacy Notice, we may use certain types of information to offer members an ad supported subscription plan or engage in certain marketing activities. Under the CCPA, this activity may be considered “selling” or “sharing.”
                This section includes important disclosures for California residents. </p><p>  If you do not wish for us to sell or share CCPA personal information about you, you can learn how to make applicable choices by clicking the “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link located in the footer of <a href="http://netflix.com" target="_blank"> netflix.com </a>                or by visiting this link: <a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/dnsspi" target="_blank"> netflix.com/dnsspi </a>. Using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” (as defined by the CCPA) personal information, or stop all behavioral
                advertising.  We do not knowingly sell, share or use the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.</p></div> <div><p>  Financial Incentives </p><p>  When you subscribe to Netflix you may choose an ad supported subscription plan. It is possible that some may interpret an ad supported subscription plan to fall within the meaning of a “financial incentive” for the purposes of the CCPA.</p><p>  If you choose an ad supported subscription plan, you will receive a discount in the price of your monthly subscription and when you watch content on Netflix, you will be presented ads which may appear before, during, or after content viewed
                on Netflix. In certain circumstances some content and features (such as downloading and viewing content in other countries) may not be accessible under an ad supported subscription plan. </p></div> <p><p>  If you would like to stop participating in an ad supported subscription plan, you can simply access the Account Settings of your Netflix account through a web browser and select a different plan that is not an ad supported subscription plan.
                The monthly fee associated with your Netflix subscription will likely increase if you move from an ad supported subscription plan to one that is not an ad supported subscription plan. We believe the reduction in monthly fee for participation
                in an ad supported subscription plan and use of the categories of CCPA personal information described above to present relevant ads to you represents a fair exchange to continue to provide members a high quality service at a lower direct
                out of pocket price to members. When considering the size of reduction in monthly fee for participating in an ad supported subscription plan, we considered projected ad revenue generated by all members projected to participate in an ad
                supported subscription plan and the overall revenue required by Netflix to operate and innovate its business, produce the content to entertain its members and make a profit.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> State Specific Sections </strong></p><p>  Sale and Use of Personal Information for Targeted Advertising Purposes. We may use certain types of information to offer members an ad supported subscription plan or engage in certain marketing activities. This
                activity may be considered “selling”, or “targeted advertising” under US State Privacy Laws. Our practices regarding sale or targeted advertising may depend on how you interact with us, the services you use and the choices you make. If
                you do not wish for us to sell or use your personal information for targeted advertising purposes, you can learn how to make applicable choices by visiting this link: <a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/dnsspi" target="_blank"> netflix.com/dnsspi </a>.
                Using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously sold personal information or stop all behavioral advertising.  </p></div> <p><p>  We have not sold personal information in the past twelve months. We have also not “shared” or made available personal information for the purposes of targeted advertising in the past twelve months. </p></p> <p><p>  Use of De-Identified Information. As described in the Your Information and Rights section of our Privacy Statement, we may de-identify personal information in a secure manner when we determine it is appropriate
