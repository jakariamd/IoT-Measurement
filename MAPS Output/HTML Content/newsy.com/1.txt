<div><h1>  Privacy Policy</h1><p>  <a href="/" target="_blank"> Scripps News </a> : Privacy Policy</p></div> <div><h2>  Overview</h2><p>  <strong> We have offices in the United States and Canada and the management of our brands is located largely at the headquarters of our parent company in Cincinnati, Ohio. </strong></p><p>  <strong> By visiting and using our products and services the personal data you share with us or that we collect automatically will be collected, stored, processed, or transferred in and to the United States where our technical infrastructure is located and operated. Some of our brands and service providers may have operations in other countries as well. </strong></p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Our sites, mobile apps, online channels, and services utilize tracking technology as described below. </strong></p></p> <div><p>  <b> What this policy covers </b></p><p>  This privacy policy applies to our collection and use of personal data in conjunction with any of our brands whose websites, or apps (“apps”) link to this policy. This policy also applies to any of our non-public systems used by partners, applicants, and employees.</p><p>  <b> We also specifically address Tracking Technology used for Advertising, Data Sharing, and Data Transfers. </b></p><p>  <b> What is personal data?  </b></p><p>  Generally, the terms personal data or personally identifiable information mean information relating to an identifiable person. In some cases, the terms may include information that identifies a household. An identifiable person is an individual who can be singled out by using information such as their name, address, or telephone number. For example, Ms. Cindy Delgado who lives at 123 Scripps Street with a telephone number of 513-513-5133 is an identifiable person. Cindy’s name, address, telephone number, and even her choice of pronoun are examples of her personal data.  </p></div> <p><p>  <b> What's not covered in this policy? </b>

In some instances, we provide links or advertisements on our sites and apps for products and services offered by other companies. You may view our content via services provided by other companies. Companies providing those products or services will have their own terms and policies, so remember that any information they collect will follow their rules and not ours.

We enable third parties such as advertising partners and website analysis firms to collect information on our websites and apps through tracking technology. The information collected through this tracking technology may be considered personal data.  </p><p>  Where we use tracking technology, you may block the technology or opt out of certain advertisements. To do so, you can activate the setting on your device that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some tracking technology; we have provided some helpful links below for various devices and operating systems. Additionally, we offer Technology Settings that allow you to control your experience on the web. Please be aware, if you use your device settings to block all tracking technology, you may not be able to access all or parts of our websites or apps or use all the available functionality. </p></div> <p><p>  The website  <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank"> www.aboutads.info </a> provides another option to opt-out of advertisements. It is important to note, the opt-out tool applies only to the device and browser you are using to opt out.  Therefore, if you use a different device, change web browsers or clear or change settings, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. Please be aware that opting out of a network advertising service does not mean that you will not receive online ads. It only means that the network from which you opted out should no longer deliver ads tailored to your preferences and interests.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> Additional information and opt-out tools: </b></p><p>  <b> Web browser and device settings: </b></p><p>  Certain browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do not wish for your online activities to be tracked for interest-based advertising purposes (“DNT Notice”). Unfortunately, given how preference-based advertising works, DNT Notices may not be effective in communicating your preferences and we do not take any action based on browser based DNT Notices. The best course of action, if you do not wish to participate in interest-based advertising activities, is to follow the directions given above. </p></div> <p><p>  Lastly, should you receive marketing or promotional emails from us that you no longer wish to receive, please click the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails, contact us directly, or for certain services, by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences.</p></p> <div><h1>  Children</h1><p>  Our websites, apps, services, and content are not generally directed towards children.
