<div><h2>  At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.</h2><p>  That’s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us. We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox for everyone.</p><p>  In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla <a href="/privacy/" target="_blank"> privacy policy </a> for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox.</p></div> <div><h2>  Firefox by default shares data to:</h2><ul>  <li><strong> Interaction data </strong>: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows; number of webpages visited; number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons; and session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals).
</li><li><strong> Technical data </strong>: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us.  When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.

We receive data about how you engage with search in Firefox and the number of searches you request from our search partners. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location data </strong>: When you first use Firefox, it uses your IP address to set your default search provider based on your country. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/change-your-default-search-settings-firefox" target="_blank"> Learn more </a>.
</li><li><strong> Search queries </strong>: Firefox by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience if your selected search provider supports search suggestions. Your selected search provider’s privacy policy governs the search provider’s collection and use of your data as you use the search provider’s services. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/search-suggestions-firefox" target="_blank"> Learn more </a>, including how to disable this feature.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Mozilla generally receives royalties when you use one of the default or optional search options in the Firefox web browser, including but not limited to Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and eBay. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>If you enable "Improve the Firefox Suggest Experience," we and our partners may also receive your search queries. <a href="#searches" target="_blank"> Learn more below </a>. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Firefox displays content, such as Add-on Recommendations, Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Firefox users), and Pocket Recommendations (which is part of the Mozilla family).</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location data </strong>: Firefox uses your IP address to suggest relevant content based on your country and state.
</li><li><strong> Technical & Interaction data </strong>: Firefox sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with content. This includes the number of times content is displayed or clicked.
</li><li><strong> Pocket Recommendations </strong>: We recommend content to you based on your browsing history, language, and country location. The process of deciding which stories you should see based on your browsing history happens locally in your copy of Firefox, and neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browsing history. To help you see relevant Pocket Recommendations based on your location, Firefox shares your language and country location with Pocket.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Mozilla and Pocket receive aggregated data about the recommendations you see and click. We also share aggregated data about the sponsored content you see and click with our third-party ad platform Kevel so advertisers can see how many people click on their articles. This aggregated data does not identify you personally.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Top Sites </strong>: When you click on a Sponsored Top Sites tile on New Tab, we share your country, region, county (if you're in the US), the tile you clicked, and the time you clicked with AdMarketplace (a third-party referral platform) to verify you navigated to the website. Firefox does not share your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you.
</li><li><strong> Add-on and Feature Recommendations </strong>: We recommend Add-ons in two places: the Manage Your Extensions Page (about:addons) and the Awesome Bar, where you search or type in URLs. We may also recommend Firefox Features in the Awesome Bar. We base the recommendations in about:addons on a cookie. We base the recommendations in the Awesome Bar on your interaction with Firefox. Mozilla does not receive your browser history. The process happens locally in your own computer’s copy of Firefox.

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Webpage data to DNS Resolver service </strong>: For some Firefox users, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy" target="_blank"> strict privacy standards for resolvers </a>. This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution.  <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_switching-providers" target="_blank"> Learn more </a> or see our default DNS resolver service providers below:</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Cloudflare </strong></li><li><strong> NextDNS </strong></li><li><strong> Comcast </strong></li><li><strong> CIRA </strong></li><li><strong> Shaw </strong></li></ul><p>  <strong> Technical data for updates </strong>: Desktop versions of Firefox check for browser updates by persistently connecting to Mozilla servers. Your Firefox version, language, and device operating system are used to apply the correct updates.

Opting out prevents Firefox from warning you of potentially illegitimate or malicious websites or downloaded files.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities </strong>: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with "HTTPS"), Firefox validates the website's <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/secure-website-certificate" target="_blank"> certificate </a>. This may involve Firefox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website.

</p></p> <p><p>  Mozilla is developing a new feature that helps deliver you better information with less effort. It’s called Firefox Suggest and an early version of it is currently available to users in the United States. By default, Firefox Suggest shows you recommended and sponsored content based on local data stored on your own computer, such as websites from your browsing history, bookmarks and open tabs. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Sites you visit </strong>: Firefox sends Mozilla which suggestions you click or dismiss and Mozilla may share that data with its <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-suggest#w_who-are-mozillas-partners" target="_blank"> partners </a>.
</li><li><strong> Location data </strong>: Firefox temporarily sends Mozilla your IP address which we use to suggest content based on your country, state, and city. Mozilla may share location information with our partners, but partners will not receive your IP address. 
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Technical & interaction data </strong>: Firefox sends Mozilla data such as the number of times Firefox suggests or displays content and your clicks on that content, as well as basic data about your interactions with Firefox Suggest. Mozilla shares information with our <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-suggest#w_who-are-mozillas-partners" target="_blank"> partners </a> about how many times suggestions are shown and clicked for verification and feature improvement.
