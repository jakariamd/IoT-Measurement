Right to opt out of “selling” or “sharing” certain Personal Information </b></p><p>  You have a right to opt out from future “sales” or “sharing” of personal information. CCPA requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell to or share with third parties and how to opt out of future sales or sharing. The CCPA defines personal information to include internet or other electronic network activity information which includes identifiers, such as IP addresses, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs. The law also defines a “sale” or “share” broadly to include simply making data available to third parties in some cases.
 </p></div> <div><p>  <b> To opt out of sharing and selling for purposes of cross context behavioral advertising you can: </b></p><p>  Review your preferences and opt out of advertising cookies and other technologies used for browser based cross context behavioral advertising. Note that you will need to opt out from each browser that you use to access Adobe websites and apps.</p><span>  Cookie settings</span><p>  Opt out of the sale or sharing of customer record information for cross context behavioral advertising and partner marketing</p></div> <div><span>  Opt-out</span><p>  Adobe websites recognize the Global Privacy Control available in some web browsers. If your browser is configured to send this signal, Adobe will opt you out of Adobe’s use of advertising cookies on that browser. You can learn more about Adobe’s <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/marketing.html" target="_blank"> advertising practices </a> and your privacy choices <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p><p>  Further, using these choices will not stop all interest-based advertising, such as contextual-based ads.
</p></div> <p><p>  <b> 2. Right to Know or Request Categories of Personal Information </b></p></p> <p><p>  You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you. You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information such as a list of the categories of personal information collected about you, and other related information such as the source of the information, categories of information shared or sold to third parties, and the purpose for such sharing. Adobe has provided this information in the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a>.
 </p></p> <p><p>  <b> 3. Right to Correct.  </b>You have a right to request correction of inaccurate personal information.
 </p></p> <p><p>  <b> 4. Right to Request Deletion. </b> You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to certain exceptions.
 </p></p> <p><p>  <b> 5. Right to Designate an Authorized Agent. </b>
You may designate an authorized agent to exercise some of your rights; however, in order to help protect the security of your personal information, the authorized agent must follow the same authentication procedures that are required if you exercise your rights without using an agent. Adobe will verify requests made through authorized agents to help ensure the safety of your account and to comply with our policies and procedures.

<b> 6. Right against Discrimination. </b>
You have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights set out in the CCPA.
 </p></p> <p><p>  <b> 7. Right to Notice.  </b>You have a right to receive notice of our practices at or before collection of personal information.
 </p></p> <p><p>  <b> Additional information on exercising your rights </b>
You have the right to exercise the rights listed above and in our <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html" target="_blank"> Privacy Policy </a> free of charge or penalty, but we may limit the number of requests you make or charge reasonable fees as legally permitted. You may exercise many of these rights yourself by adjusting your preferences as outlined on the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_blank"> Your Privacy Choices </a> page, or you can get in touch with us by filling out a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/privacy-contact.html" target="_blank"> privacy inquiry form. </a>
 </p></p> <p><p>  Where you exercise your rights yourself, you will need to be logged on with your Adobe ID and password or on the browser of your device.
