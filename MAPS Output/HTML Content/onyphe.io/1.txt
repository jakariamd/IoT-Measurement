ONYPHE ("ONYPHE", "we", "our", or "us") understands that privacy is important to our online visitors to our Web site (our "Web site").

Web and reverse proxy logs including Access time, IP Address and its Geolocation, Browser Version and Referrer may be kept to analyse site performance and Web site security monitoring along with authenticated user's Email Address and complete ONYPHE Queries. We keep logs for 12-months.


We do analyze queries to identify emerging and interesting patterns we can use to improve our solution.


Furthermore, we carefully monitor Free user's queries to identify any abuse attempt and we delete abuser's accounts with no prior notice. We created a Cyber Defense Search Engine, not a Cyber Offense one.
