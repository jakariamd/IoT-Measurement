The extent of testing for each tested series is described below. This does not represent any assurance or guarantee of a durability of our marketed product series for 20 years. Notwithstanding testing during development phase individual machines may require occasional servicing or may require repair or replacement of core components. In this respect, the statutory warranty provisions apply and – where applicable – additional provisions on product warranty within the general sales terms for the Miele product.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> WASHING MACHINES </strong></p><p>  MIELE has tested development models and core components during the development phase of the washing machine series W 1 (front loader models) in tough endurance tests. The aim of these tests conducted by MIELE is to simulate average usage over a period of 20 years.
The basis for determining the test conditions for the endurance test is the average consumer habits known from studies and surveys. MIELE uses a total of 5,000 wash cycles with different programs as a basis. This corresponds to 5 wash cycles per week with use in 50 weeks per year over a period of 20 years. The requirements derived from this were translated into test conditions. In addition to the exact test conditions, these also specify the number of test items to be tested in order to obtain statistically reliable test results.
These tests carried out by MIELE during development phase are monitored by our employees. The corresponding results are recorded and evaluated by us. The washing machine series is not released until the test results meet the specified criteria for the reliability of the washing machine series.
The tests carried out by MIELE "To the equivalent of 20 years use" are based on a comprehensive concept, which has been implemented by operating instructions, laboratory test instructions and supplementary factory standards. This concept has been reviewed as part of an operational stability study with the result that this concept is complete, it corresponds to the state of the art and with this approach it is possible to test washing machines for a service life of 20 years based on the average use by an average household (Fraunhofer Institut, Expertise LBF- No. 307049 -ExW).
This does not represent any assurance or guarantee of a durability of our marketed washing machines for 20 years.
