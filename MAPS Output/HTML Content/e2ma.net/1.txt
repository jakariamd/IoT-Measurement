<div><h1>  Permission & Privacy Policy</h1><p>  We’re dedicated to protecting your privacy and the privacy of anyone on the receiving end of an email from our service. To that end, we have instituted certain policies to help us make sure our service remains a safe, trusted environment for email marketing and correspondence.</p><p>  Here, we outline those policies and our efforts to enforce them.</p></div> <div><h3>  A simple, straightforward policy on permission</h3><p>  We use a permission-based email-marketing platform. It is designed to let organizations send emails to people who want to receive those emails. Our permission policy is part of the Terms of Use agreed to by every customer, and it appears as a reminder on our import process every time new lists are added. It goes beyond the stipulations set forth in the United States’ Can-Spam legislation and is as follows:</p><ul>  <li>To send an email to someone using our system, that recipient must be:</li><li>Someone who is a customer, member or subscriber of your business or organization,</li><li>Someone who has specifically asked to receive your emails by opting in or signing up in some way, or</li><li>Someone who has bought a product or service from you in the past 18 months</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  No list rental or purchasing here</h3><p>  While many services allow you to purchase or otherwise obtain a list of addresses of people you’ve never met and send them emails, we do not. We do not rent, sell, or otherwise share our lists or those of our customers, and we do not allow any customer to rent or purchase lists and send to them using our network.</p></div> <div><h3>  Why we don’t allow list rentals or purchases</h3><p>  We go beyond the Can-Spam law to prohibit the sending of unsolicited commercial emails to any lists that have been rented or purchased. Why? Because we’ve learned that lists obtained in that manner aren’t worth the trouble and expense. We know that email works best when it appeals to an audience that’s receptive to your message, and that begins with a true permission-based list.</p></div> <div><h3>  No old lists, either</h3><p>  When it comes to sending permission-based email, the age of the list matters. If enough time passes between someone initially subscribing to your list and eventually receiving an email from you, permission “expires” as people eventually forget what they’ve signed up for. That’s why we don’t allow sending to any email address that was obtained more than 18 months ago and has not received any correspondence from you since that time.</p></div> <div><h3>  Protecting your customer lists and data</h3><p>  We do everything we can to make sure your customer lists, email content and response data remains private and confidential. Though we reserve the right to monitor your lists, content and response data from time to time to make sure they comply with our Terms of Use, we will never share, sell or rent your customer data to anyone for any reason.</p></div> <div><h3>  A note about social media</h3><p>  We use an industry standard method called OAuth for connecting your social accounts to our application. The permissions granted allow us to post messages to your social networks on your behalf. All messages are initiated by our users, and we never post on your behalf without your consent. We do not store login, password or personal information in our system and you can remove authorization for any or all networks at any time. We will not use, share, display or transfer any data returned from any network with any third party at any time.</p></div> <div><h3>  To sum things up…</h3><p>  Your privacy, and the privacy of people on both sides of the emails you send, is extremely important to us, and we’ll do everything we can to protect it.</p></div> <div><h3>  Related Articles</h3></div> <div><h4>  Categories</h4></div>
