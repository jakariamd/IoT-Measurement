operation) in the ten fortieth degree of time is weaker electrical. It can not 
destroy chemical substances, but can order their structure. It is capable, for 
example, to change an odor of substances, to delay or to speed up development 
seeds, to promote the extension or compression of an alive cell and so on. </p><p>  The screen for a gravitational field is not known.</p><p>  THE DEVICE Gragend-1 contains an active element as monocrystal, by which the 
variable voltage from the built-in generator is applied.</p></div> <p><p>  The atoms of an active element under an operation of an electrical field 
change, and around there is a variable gravitational field.</p></p> <p><p>  The character of a force of gravitational effect depends on a direction of 
movement of a varying point. For want of transversal oscillations (the 
transversal field - area B) weakens, and for want of longitudinal (longitudinal 
field - the area A) will increase. </p></p> <p><p>  The magnitude of a force decreases with a distance.</p></p> <div><p>  GRAGEND - 3</p><p>  The capillary tube from the dielectric, which has been filled in with a weak

are cut is going gragend, for example, from a tooth powder, number from 15 up to 
40. From polyethylene the disks by a diameter on 3 mm smaller are cut, at which 
center the orifice by a diameter about 3 mm is cut. The assembly of paper disks 
divided by disks from polyethylene is going. The assembly at center is pierced 
by a wire; it is better silvered, have with the lower party a closed loop by a 
diameter about 8 mm located perpendicularly to a wire. Along a wall of a box the 
brass or copper foil is stacked. The assembly is located in a box, to a central 
wire and to a foil the flexible wires are soldered, through which to gragend the 
variable voltage from the generator, for example, assembled on the scheme 1 is 
bringed. The paper of gragend is impregnated with weak solutions of various 
substances, for example, water, vodka, medicine. The effect depends on effect 
gragend from assembly, solution, frequency, form and amplitude of bringed 
voltage and from a distance from gragend up to object of effect.</p></div> <p><p>  Scheme 1.
