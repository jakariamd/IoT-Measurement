What do you collect then?</h2><p>  If you have ever contacted the company with a question/concern we collect certain information at the time you write to us, such as email address. We collect this information solely so we can respond to your inquiry. </p></div> <div><h2>  So if you collect this information, how do I know you are not sharing my personal information?</h2><p>  All information that is collected is always in the aggregate and is non-personally identifiable. We never sell or share any individual or personally-identifiable user information.</p><p>  We only share products consisting of anonymous aggregated insights with select third parties who enter into contracts with us and have agreed to safeguard the information with the same care as we do. </p></div> <p><p>  Our business partners are retail brands and agency partners looking for aggregated marketing insights. These partners receive anonymous aggregated insights to select and serve relevant ads, perform marketing analytics and marketing insights to customers and partners.</p></p> <div><h2>  What is aggregate data?</h2><p>  Data points that are formed by adding together several information points that prevent identifying any individual user.</p></div> <div><h2>  Why do you have advertising on your products?</h2><p>  We offer our services for free.

This anonymous aggregated location data can be used for targeted advertising or marketing analytics. In other words, we look at trends/groups, not individuals.  For example, identifying aggregate user segments going to ski hills to target ski related advertising.  </p></div> <div><h2>  What is "personal information"?</h2><p>  In Canadian law, under PIPEDA “personal information” is defined as: any factual or subjective information, recorded or not, about an identifiable individual (ex.
