<div><h1>   AerServ GDPR Compliance Guide</h1><p>  Background</p><p>  The <strong> General Data Protection Regulation </strong> (<strong> GDPR </strong>) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a </p><span>  regulation by which the </span><span>  European Parliament, the </span><span>  Council of the European Union, and the </span><span>  European Commission intend to strengthen and unify </span><span>  data protection for all individuals within the </span><span>  European Union (EU).</span><p>  Table of Contents</p></div> <div><h1>  <strong> GDPR FAQ  </strong></h1><span>  1. How will GDPR affect ad revenue?</span><p>  GDPR regulation dictates that when an ad request needs GDPR compliance, in order to process an end user’s PII (personal identifiable information) to serve personalized advertising you must have the end user’s consent. Without user consent, only non-personalized ads can be shown. Serving non-personalized ads over personalized ads will have a significant impact on revenue.</p><span>  2. How does GDPR affect ad serving?</span></div> <p><p>  Under GDPR requirements, there are a few areas of ad serving that will be impacted.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Personalized ads
</li><li>Personalized ads will only be shown when the request needs GDPR compliance if:
</li><li>You have agreed to AerServ’s GDPR Data Rider</li><li>You have updated your integration</li><li>You are collecting and transmitting valid user consent

</li><li>Mediation</li><li>Because of strict data transfer policies, requests needing GDPR compliance, AerServ will only be able to transmit personal information to our preferred connections.
</li><li>We will not be able to transmit personal information to custom ad sources.
</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li> 
<strong> Please note: </strong>
</li></ul><p>   
</p><ul>  <li>Virtual Currency</li><li>A request needing GDPR compliance, that does not have user consent, will not be able to use the user ID to properly frequency cap the user to limit their reward amount. We recommend you only serve rewarded ads to user's who have given consent.</li><li>User Frequency Capping</li><li>A request needing GDPR compliance, that does not have user consent, will not be able to use the user ID to properly frequency cap the user at any level in the UI. Please be careful using user frequency caps if your users are not giving their consent to process PII.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Publisher custom keys</li><li>Because publisher custom keys are unstructured data AerServ will drop any custom keys on a request needing GDPR compliance that does not have user consent.
