Websites, apps and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer or other device so the website, app or other service can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that website, app or other service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Site, such as pages you have visited, the videos and other content you have viewed and advertisements you have seen. Cookies and other tracking technologies may also be used by us or by our service providers to collect and store information on your use of other companies’ websites or services, such as sites you visit and materials you view. We may merge this with other data we collect about you from third parties to assist us in our ability to provide the Site and our Services, including, without limitation, to advertise and provide content to you.</p></p> <p><p>  Third parties that provide services to Infillion, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate Site usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Site or third party services. Infillion does not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Data From Third Parties </strong>.
