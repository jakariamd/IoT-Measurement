In addition, the exercise of the rights described above may result in a different price, rate, or quality level of product or service where that difference is reasonably related to the impact the right has on our relationship or is otherwise permitted by law.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Please note that your ability to invoke the rights above are limited pursuant to the scope and limitations of the CCPA, including any available exceptions. For example, an access request can only be made twice by a Consumer within a 12-month period. </li><li><strong> How to invoke your rights </strong></li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Toast has established an individual rights portal as well as other channels for the purposes of submitting the individual rights requests above, including the right of access and deletion.

This may include your name, email address, phone number or other details related to your use of Toast’s Services. Where applicable, these requests can be submitted by an authorized agent through the channels described above in accordance with the applicable law.  In these instances, we will take steps to verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter containing your name and contact information, the name and contact information of the authorized agent, and a statement of authorization for the request. Depending on the evidence provided, we may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm the authorized agent has permission to act on your behalf and to verify your identity in connection with the request. Please note that in certain circumstances, we may refuse to act or impose limitations on your rights, as permitted by the applicable law in relation to individual rights submissions.</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li><em> To Exercise the Right to Opt Out of the Selling or Sharing of Personal Information  </em></li></ul><p>  Unless you have exercised your right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, we may “sell” or “share” your personal data to third parties for targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising purposes, for personalization features and for tracking and analytics purposes. The third parties to whom we sell or share personal information may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy statements. In these instances, the right to opt out of the sale of personal information can be invoked through our cookie management tool that can be accessed by clicking on our “Do not sell or share my personal information” link at the bottom of <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/" target="_blank"> https://pos.toasttab.com </a>.

Please note that your opt out will be specific to the device and browser you use when you opt out, and our Websites will recognize opt-out preference settings only on domains of our Websites where any “selling” or “sharing” occurs.  Although Toast does not currently engage in other practices at this time that may constitute a “sale” or “sharing” beyond these instances and the methods above are the most effective methods to manage your preferences, you may also submit your right to opt out of any sales or sharing by clicking <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/privacy/individualrightscenter" target="_blank"> here </a> or in instances where you would like additional support. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your right to opt out of personal information sales or sharing. However, if applicable, we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify you in our dataset and to track compliance with your opt out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not to provide this information, we may only be able to process your request to the extent we are able to identify you in our systems. Once you make an opt-out request, you may change your mind and opt back in to future personal information sales at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@toasttab.com" target="_blank"> privacy@toasttab.com </a> or by managing your preferences within the cookie management tool.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Accessibility </strong></li></ul><p>  In the event you are a user with a disability, or are supporting an individual with a disability, and are having difficulty navigating this Statement or the information linked within this Statement, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@toasttab.com" target="_blank"> privacy@toasttab.com </a> for support. </p><ul>  <li><strong> Sensitive Personal Information </strong></li></ul><p>  As part of our services, Toast collects “sensitive personal information” as defined by the CCPA as part of our operations and the Services offered to our Merchants.

However, if necessary, we may retain personal information for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire, or for instances where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator or other government authority. </p></div> <p><p>  To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other applicable obligations. </p></p> <p><p>  As to each of the categories of personal information collected, the retention period will vary depending on our relationship. For example,</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>For Merchants and Merchant Employees, we will generally retain their personal information for the duration of our agreement with the Merchant plus a period following termination as provided for in our retention schedules. </li><li>For Guests that have Toast Digital Ordering Accounts, Toast will generally maintain these accounts for the duration of the individual’s use of service plus a period of inactivity.</li><li>In other cases, Guest information that is collected by the Merchant but stored by Toast will be retained for the duration of our agreement with the Merchant plus a period following termination as provided for in our retention schedules. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Information pertaining to support calls are generally retained for one (1) year but may be retained for longer based on the nature of the relationship between Toast and the individual. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In all cases, the retention will be subject to any additional legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other applicable obligations.</p></p> <p><p>  Once retention of the personal information is no longer necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either delete or de-identify the personal information or, if this is not possible (for example, because personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store the personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion or deidentification is possible.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Notice of Financial Incentives and loyalty programs </strong></li></ul><p>  A core part of our business involves the design and implementation of programs and other offerings intended to provide benefits to eligible participants that are managed by our Merchants. One example of that is that as part of our Services, we provide our Merchants with the ability to provide a loyalty program to its restaurant customers. To the extent that a Merchant is required to provide a notice of financial incentive pursuant to the CCPA, this obligation is the responsibility of the Merchant as part of the set up and administration of its program. Please refer to the terms and privacy notice of the Merchant with which you have a relationship for information regarding any financial incentives they may offer through those loyalty services.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Deidentified information </strong></li></ul><p>  We may at times receive, or process personal information to create, deidentified information that can no longer reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular individual or household. Where we maintain deidentified information, we will maintain and use the information in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the information except as required or permitted by law.</p><ul>  <li><strong> Updates to this Statement </strong></li></ul></div> <p><p>  We will update this Statement from time to time.
