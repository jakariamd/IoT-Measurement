In the event that there is a change of ownership or control of your personal data or usage information, we will post a prominent notice to that effect on our Site.</p></p> <div><h3>  Transferring Personal Data</h3><p>  FactSet is a global organization headquartered in the United States, and we may need to transfer your personal data to third party suppliers and to our affiliates for the purposes described above. If your personal data is subject to the GDPR and is transferred outside the EU to other FactSet affiliates or to third party service providers, we will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EU, including by entering into data transfer agreements using the European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes. For transfers of personal data among FactSet affiliates we have put in place European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses and have entered into an Intragroup data transfer agreement. You have a right to obtain details of the mechanism under which your personal data is transferred outside of the EU, although please note that we may need to redact copies of transfer agreements for reasons of commercial confidentiality, provided that you can retain access to the relevant safeguards.</p></div> <p><p>  With respect to the information you provide to us through the recruitment or employment process, we may share and transfer your data with other members of the FactSet Group located globally (including in countries outside EU/EEA, such as the United States of America, India and the Philippines). FactSet has adopted an Intra-Group Data Transfer Agreement to ensure your personal data receives an adequate level of protection wherever it is processed within the FactSet group.</p></p> <p><p>  FactSet reserves the right to share any information that you provide which is not deemed personal data or is not otherwise subject to contractual restrictions.</p></p> <div><h3>  Retention of Your Personal Data</h3><p>  We keep personal data only for as long as required to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. In general, we retain personal data for a period of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, for example to maintain an accurate record of customer and supplier dealings. However, in some circumstances we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax or accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required in accordance with our document retention policy.</p></div> <p><p>  With respect to personal data we obtain from job applicants through the recruitment process, our general approach is to retain your application for a period of 6 months or, where you consent to a longer period of retention, for up to 2 years following the closure of the recruitment process for the role you applied for. Otherwise, you should note that, in certain cases, legal or regulatory obligations require us to retain specific records for a set period of time. If you accept employment with FactSet, your personal data will be held on the basis set out in our Employee Data Privacy Notice, which will be shared with you following your hiring.</p></p> <div><h3>  Your Rights</h3><p>  You may have certain rights in connection with the personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us.

Unfortunately, while we work hard to ensure the security of your personal data while it is on our systems, no security measures are perfect, and data transmitted over the Internet is not guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot and do not ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you transmit, and you do so at your own risk.</p></div> <p><p>  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our jobsites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone and you are responsible for the confidentiality of the password related to your account.</p></p> <div><h3>  Links to Other Websites</h3><p>  Our Sites may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information.

Employees are expected to report concerns, using the appropriate reporting channels, and management are expected to act upon them. We are proud of the corporate social responsibility work we carry out in our local communities.

</span></div> <div><h2>  UK Tax Strategy</h2><span>  Financial year ending August 31, 2023</span><p>  FactSet Research Systems Inc. (the “Company” or “FactSet”) is a multinational company headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States with operations across 23 countries. FactSet was founded in 1978 and provides integrated financial information and analytical applications for the global investment community.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Introduction to FactSet’s UK Tax Strategy </strong></h3><p>  FactSet has substantial local operations and presence in the UK. FactSet is committed to conduct its tax affairs in accordance with the following objectives:</p><ul>  <li>Act as a responsible global corporate tax citizen in compliance with applicable tax law, regulations and reporting disclosure requirements;</li><li>Maintain an open relationship with tax authorities based on collaboration and integrity;</li><li>Apply diligence and care in the management of processes and procedures by which all tax related activities are undertaken;</li><li>Encourage ethical and transparent business practices;</li><li>Use available incentives and reliefs while ensuring that these reliefs are not used for purposes which are knowingly contradictory to the intent of the legislation.</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Risk Management and Governance </strong></h3><p>  FactSet believes that it is important to pay the correct amount of tax at the right time, under all relevant laws and regulations. We are committed to provide transparent and accessible information to tax administrators in order to facilitate an understanding of our tax strategy and the underlying business models. We operate an effective tax control framework to identify key tax risks and to manage those risks through appropriately designed and operated controls, polices and processes.</p></div> <div><h3>  Tax Strategy and Strategic Objectives</h3><p>  Generally, FactSet’s tax strategy and strategic objectives are intended to establish a clear and unequivocal approach to all aspects of tax reporting and compliance.Our strategy is focused on ensuring that taxes (and tax risks) are managed to provide outcomes consistent with commercial reality and are within the parameters of our strategic objectives. The strategy also requires that all tax obligations are complied with in the UK and all other relevant jurisdictions.With the tax landscape constantly changing, FactSet’s tax affairs and tax risk management procedures are regularly reviewed to ensure that processes and measures are up-to-date so that we are able to identify, assess, manage and mitigate tax risk as well as remain aligned with FactSet’s business strategy and governance framework.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Level of Acceptable Tax Risk </strong></h3><p>  We aim for certainty on the tax positions we adopt, so diligent professional care and judgment is employed to assess tax risks arising from our commercial operations. We seek to reduce the level of tax risk arising from operations as far as is practically reasonable through an ongoing commitment to improving internal control effectiveness and by ensuring that all tax or tax-related processes are allocated to appropriately qualified owners.FactSet’s level of acceptable risk is low, and we structure our affairs based on sound commercial principles and in accordance with company policy and relevant tax legislation. FactSet will consider different tax outcomes when considering how to undertake commercially motivated transactions, but does not participate in aggressive tax planning for the purposes of tax avoidance or engage in tax schemes that go against the intention of the legislative authority.</p></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Approach towards Dealings with HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) </strong></h3><p>  It is FactSet’s general policy to be transparent and proactive in all interactions with HMRC.</p><p>  We have an open, honest and positive working relationship with HMRC. We are committed to prompt disclosure and transparency in all tax matters with HMRC. We recognize that there will be areas of differing legal interpretations between ourselves and HMRC and where this occurs we will engage in proactive discussion to bring matters to as rapid a conclusion as possible.</p></div> <div><span>  UK Tax Strategy
