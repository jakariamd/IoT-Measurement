(dba Voicea), Scientific-Atlanta LLC, and ThousandEyes LLC (collectively "Cisco-US") complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield.
</p></p> <p><p>  Cisco-US has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy statement and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

</p></p> <p><p>  Although the Privacy Shield has been invalidated as a transfer mechanism, Cisco-US is committed to protecting all Personal Information received from European Union (EU) member countries, the UK, and Switzerland (see above <a href="#collection-and-use-of-your-personal-information" target="_blank"> Collection and use of your Personal Information </a> for examples of the Personal Information Cisco processes when you use our websites and Solutions and interact with us), in accordance with the Frameworks' applicable Principles and to ensuring Personal Information collected from individuals in the EU is accessible to them as part of their individual rights when Cisco is the Controller of the Personal Information.

</p></p> <div><h2>  Automated decision-making</h2><p>  Our processing of Personal Information includes both automated and manual methods of processing. Our automated methods are often used to assist our manual methods. When automated methods are used to assist in decision-making, we may manually review some of the insights produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the insights were made. This manual review may be conducted by Cisco employees or trusted third-party business partners who are working on Cisco's behalf.</p></div> <p><p>  In the event that decisions are made solely based on automated methods of processing and produce legal effect or significantly affect an individual, we will provide the impacted individual the opportunity to question the decision or request manual review.</p></p> <div><h2>  Complaint resolution</h2><p>  In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Cisco-U.S. commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information transferred to the United States. European Union, United Kingdom, and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Cisco-US via the <a href="https://privacyrequest.cisco.com/" target="_blank"> Privacy Request Form </a>.</p><p>  Cisco-U.S. has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, BBB EU Privacy Shield.

Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p></div> <p><p>  Cisco has a comprehensive Privacy Statement and provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.
