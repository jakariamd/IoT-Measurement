<div><h2>  Sony Electronics Inc. Privacy Policy </h2><p>  <i> Last Updated and Effective: </i> July 1, 2023</p><p>  This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") applies only to the information collected by Sony Electronics Inc. (<b> “SEL” </b>,<b> “we” </b>, <b> “us” </b> or <b> “our” </b>), both offline and online, through SEL’s websites and any other websites, web pages, applications, interactive features, and other online, wireless or other offerings that post a link to this Privacy Policy, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology (collectively, <b> “Properties” </b>).  Sony’s Card Marketing and Services Company, the Sony Rewards Program, and other SEL affiliated companies (<b> “Affiliates” </b>) offer their own independent websites, apps and online features, including some that are linked to/from the Properties, and have their own privacy policies. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Sony Group” companies include Sony Corporation (or its successor) and those companies owned or controlled by Sony Corporation (or its successor), directly or indirectly, including Affiliates and others which share the “SONY” branding. </p></div> <p><p>  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the applicable terms and conditions applicable to the Properties you may use, including the <a href="/terms-conditions" target="_blank"> Terms and Conditions </a> for our website, which govern your use of the Properties and any related services. </p></p> <div><h3>  This Privacy Policy explains: </h3><ul>  <li>State Notices</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  <b> Collection of Information </b></h4><p>  We collect information from you directly, automatically when you visit or use the Properties, and sometimes from third parties. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” or “personal data,” and some of which may be considered “sensitive” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as your name, phone number, e-mail address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. If we combine information we consider to be non-personal with personal information, we will treat that combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy. In some cases, we may de-identify or pseudonymize personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code, sometimes using a function commonly known as a “hash.” Such codes do not identify you directly, but may be used to connect your activity and interests. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. </p></div> <div><h4>  <i> Information You Provide To SEL  </i></h4><p>  When you interact with SEL or our Properties, we may ask you to provide various information, including contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail address, mailing address, and telephone number) and other information about yourself, such as demographic information (i.e., gender, zip code, age, etc.), or certain information about your preferences and interests.  We may also ask you to provide additional information in connection with a feature or service we offer.  For example, if you are registering a product, we may collect device or service information, or, if you make a purchase, we will collect payment information and related transaction information.</p></div> <p><p>  If you contact our customer service centers for assistance by any means, including written communications or via our chat features, support forums, telephone, email, or social media channels, we may collect your phone number, record and use customer service calls or chats (where permitted by applicable law), or ask for device identifiers, such as an IMEI number from a mobile device. We may collect other information that you may provide to us in connection with the service request, including information about your health conditions, such as information about your hearing in connection with our hearing aid products. Some of our customer service processes, including chatbots and call/chat monitoring and recording, are operated by third party service providers. Content you provide to us by any channel may be sent to and stored by our third party service providers. </p></p> <p><p>  Through certain features or in the course of providing services to you, you may also provide us with photos and videos or other content. Please note that if you upload content or provide us with photos or videos, such images may include metadata which can reveal information about the images, including but not limited to, where and when they were taken.    </p></p> <div><h4>  <i> Information That SEL May Collect Automatically  </i></h4><p>  In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, whenever you visit or interact with the Properties or our content, SEL, as well as our third-party analytics and advertising providers or other service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Properties are accessed and used (<b> “Usage Information" </b>). Usage Information may include, without limitation, browser type, operating system, the page served, time spent on the Properties, the pages you have viewed, and location information.</p></div> <p><p>  SEL may also automatically collect your IP address, or other unique device identifiers (<b> “Device Identifiers" </b>) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (each, a <b> “Device" </b>) you use to access the Properties. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access the Properties or our servers, so that our systems can identify your Device. We may also collect an Advertising ID (such as the Android AAID), which is assigned by the platform operator for the applicable Device.</p></p> <p><p>  In accordance with applicable law, (including with your consent if required), we may also automatically collect information related to your physical behavior or health, voice recognition and utterance data when using a voice command, or biometric information, such as voice authentication or fingerprint, for identification purposes. </p></p> <p><p>  Third parties may also use technologies that automatically or passively collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit or use our Properties or other online websites and services. For example, some third parties' embedded content or plugins on the Properties, such as social media sharing tools, allow them to learn that you or your Device have visited or interacted with our Properties, and they may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services. These third parties may handle this information, and other information they directly collect through their content and plugins, pursuant to their own privacy policies.   </p></p> <div><p>  <i> The technologies used on the Properties to collect Usage Information and/or Device Identifiers by us or third parties include:   </i></p><p>  Cookies. "Cookies" (which may be .html files, or other technology) are small text files that help store user preferences and activity.  A Cookie is placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Properties or otherwise access our online offerings. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to our web pages and customizing your experience on the Properties. You may configure your browser or Device to block the use of cookies. Please refer to <a href="/privacy-policy#advertisinganalytics" target="_blank"> Advertising and Analytics Providers and Your Choices </a> section for more information , including how to manage or opt-out of  certain cookies. For more information about cookies and managing cookies generally, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. </p></div> <p><p>  Web Beacons.  “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, pixel tags, GIFS or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect advertising data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Properties, to monitor how users navigate the Properties, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened or to determine whether content sent was actually viewed.</p></p> <p><p>  Embedded Scripts.  “Embedded scripts” are programming codes that are designed to collect information about your interactions with the Properties, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Properties, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p></p> <p><p>  Session Replay.  Session replay technology, also referred to as session playback or user experience (UX) replay, collects information regarding and tracks your interactions with a website or application.  It then transforms those logged user events (such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, scrolling, tapping, etc.) into a reproduction of what you actually did on the website or application.  We use session replays for quality control, customer service, fraud prevention and security, and marketing purposes.  Our session replay technology is owned and operated by a third-party who acts as our service provider.  The information collected by this technology may be collected and stored by our third-party service provider.</p></p> <div><h4>  <i> Location Data  </i></h4><p>  We may collect information about your location from your Device. In some cases, this may  include the precise location of your Device. We may collect location information using different  types of technologies, including IP address, GPS or Wi-Fi. If you use one of our mobile  applications, we may also access your Device’s location information in the background when you give us permission. You may be able to turn off the collection of precise location information through the settings on your Device. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our service providers with information regarding the physical location of a Device used to access the Properties. </p></div> <div><h4>  <i> Information We Receive from Third Parties </i></h4><p>  SEL may receive information about you from various third parties.  For example, if you purchase products or services from a retail store, mobile network operator, or from an online retailer linked from the Properties, we may receive certain information about your purchase, such as your contact information, a mobile device IMEI code or other product identifier, and transaction information from the retailer. In addition, if you are on another property and you opt-in to receive information from us, that property may forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. </p></div> <p><p>  We may also supplement and combine the information we collect about you with information we may receive from Sony Group companies or with outside records from third parties, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and other third party data providers, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor and customize our content, offers and advertisements to you on the Properties and elsewhere online, and to enhance our products and service</p></p> <div><h4>  <b> Use of Collected Information and Your Choices  </b></h4><p>  SEL may use the information it collects, including personal information, to provide products and services to you and for the following purposes:</p><p>  (i) to create your SEL account that can be used to register a product or sign-in to various Sony Group services, including through a Linked Account;</p><p>  (ii) to process your transaction(s);</p><p>  (iii) to process and allow your registration and participation in programs and features we and Sony Group companies offer, including, at times, to verify that the e-mail address or other information you provide is active and valid;</p></div> <p><p>  (iv) to provide you with marketing, advertising and requested content, including newsletters from us or Sony Group companies;</p></p> <p><p>  (v) to tailor the content, advertisements, and offers you may see on our Properties or elsewhere online and to determine which products, services, promotions or other offerings might be of interest to you;</p></p> <p><p>  (vi) to provide you with information about your account, and the products and services you use;</p></p> <p><p>  (vii) to provide customer support and service to you in connection with a product or service or your use of the Properties, including software updates;</p></p> <p><p>  (viii) to develop, maintain and improve the Properties and our products and services; </p></p> <p><p>  (ix)	for internal business, legal and compliance purposes, including for security, to monitor the Properties and for fraud prevention; </p></p> <p><p>  (x)	to contact you with regard to your use of the Properties, your account, and, in our discretion, changes to any of our policies; </p></p> <div><p>  (xi)	for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information; or </p><p>  (xii)	otherwise with your consent</p><p>  To change or update the personal information you have provided to SEL, you may be able to update your account yourself by using your account settings, or you may contact us as indicated in the “Contact Us” section below.

We are under no obligation to store such personal information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such personal information. </p></p> <div><h4>  <b> When and With Whom SEL May Share Information Collected  </b></h4><p>  Except as may be prohibited by law, we may share non-personal information, such as aggregate user statistics, hashed or otherwise de-identified or pseudonymized information, demographic information and Usage Information, with third parties in our discretion.</p><p>  We may also share your information, including your personal information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information, as set forth in this Privacy Policy, with your consent, and in the following circumstances: </p></div> <p><p>  <b> Sony Group </b>. We may share your personal information and other information within and among the Sony Group companies for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to, (i) providing you with or contacting you about content, products, services or other offerings, such as games, videos, music, and software that may be of interest to you; (ii) administration of offers or Promotions; (iii) business and product development; (iv) community forum administration or development; (v) to support various business processes and provide services; (vi) providing customer service; (vii) for security, monitoring, compliance and legal purposes; and (viii) for customer analysis, research and development.   </p></p> <p><p>  <i> Linked Sony Accounts </i>. You may choose to link your SEL account with other Sony accounts established with certain other Sony Group properties. For example, you may be able to link your accounts for different Sony applications and services within the Sony Group so you can use the same account sign in details (email address and password) to access them all (<b> “Linked Accounts” </b>). Sony Group companies will use personal information relating to your Linked Account to synchronize your account details, allow you to more easily manage your accounts, and provide better customer support. Sony Group companies may also use information relating to your Linked Account to serve advertisements and marketing and for internal business purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have a Linked Account, the Sony Group company operating each service you are accessing will continue to use your account details and any data collected when you use that service in accordance with its privacy policy, which will be posted on its website. Creating a Linked Account does not change this. If you wish to exercise any personal information rights you may have in connection with an individual account, you will need to contact the relevant Sony Group company controlling the account. In the event that you wish to cancel or terminate some or all of the accounts under your Linked Account, you will need to follow the account cancellation process for each individual service or account you wish to cancel. </p></p> <p><p>  <b> Non-Affiliated Entities Providing Services on Our Behalf. </b> We may employ third parties to perform functions on our behalf; examples include hosting or operating the Properties; sending e-mails, mobile message communications, and other communications, such as surveys; providing customer support and service; executing interactive voice response (IVR) programs; and performing data analysis and serving advertisements. We may share personal information with third parties for them to provide content, complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform services for SEL.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Third Party Business Partners. </b> We may offer you the opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from third parties or to otherwise consent to the sharing of your information with a third party. If you choose to have your personal information shared, your personal information will be disclosed to the third party and the personal information you disclose will be subject to the privacy policy and business practices of that third party. If you consent to receiving communications from third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Business Transfers. </b> SEL or any of its assets, including the Properties, may be sold, or other transactions may occur in which your personal information is one of the key business assets for the transaction. In such a case, your personal information may be one of the business assets we transfer. Hence, SEL reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including personal information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, reorganization, the sale of certain stock and/or assets, or other corporate change including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Legal Protections and Law Enforcement. </b> We may transfer and disclose information, including personal information, Usage Information and Device Identifiers, to third parties: to comply with a legal obligation; to prevent fraud; when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce SEL terms of use or other applicable policies; to respond to an emergency; or otherwise to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of third parties, visitors to our Properties or the public. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion. Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Business Partners for Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. </b> We, the Sony Group companies, and our third-party partners may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions or co-promotions (each, a “Promotion”) that may require registration.

To participate in certain Community Forums, you may be asked to select a username, screen name or member name and password. Please do not use your real name or email address or the real name of another person when selecting a username (or screen name or member name). </p></div> <p><p>  Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public, and others will have access to your User Submissions and may view, collect and use that information or share it with third parties.

In addition, when you are on the Properties you may be directed to other websites that are operated and controlled by third parties that are beyond our control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and partners that may use our logo(s) as part of a co-branding agreement. In addition, SEL content and widgets may be included on web pages and websites that are not associated with us and over which we have no control. These other websites may send their own cookies to your Device, and they may independently collect data or solicit personal information. Third parties may also use technologies that automatically or passively collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit or use our Properties or other online websites and services. SEL is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party.</p></div> <div><h4>  <b> Social Media Applications </b></h4><p>   The Properties may have features that include an interactive third-party website or service, such as Facebook ("Social Media"). For example, you may be able to “like” a product or online content, “share” content to other properties, and otherwise link the Properties with Social Media. If you choose to “like” or “share” content or to otherwise post information from or via the Properties to Social Media, that information may become public and the third-party property may have access to information about you and your use of the Properties. </p></div> <p><p>  You may also choose to participate on Social Media (such as one of our Facebook pages or a similar application or feature on a third-party property, or otherwise linking the Properties with another Social Media website, application or online service) such that you are connecting that third-party Social Media service with our Properties.  You may also have the opportunity to log-in through or otherwise connect your account on a Social Media service through the Properties, including using your Social Media log-in information to create an account with SEL. Doing so may allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Properties with that third-party property, which may then collect information about your visits to our Properties and may publish that activity as you request to your "profile" or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share content you find on one of our Properties with your "connections" on the third party's property). We may also receive information about you if other users of Social Media give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections.” </p></p> <p><p>  These Social Media platforms may be able to collect certain information about your visits to the Properties regardless of whether or not you affirmatively interact with the feature and whether or not you are logged into (or have) an account with the Social Media platform. These Social Media platforms may combine this information with other, identifiable information they have collected about your visits to other websites or online services, pursuant to their own privacy policies. </p></p> <p><p>  The information we collect via Social Media is subject to this Privacy Policy. However, the information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us or with other third parties, the types of information shared, and your choices regarding what is visible to others on that third party's property. The third party may allow you to remove an application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. </p></p> <div><h4>  <b> Advertising and Analytics Providers and Your Choices  </b></h4><p>  SEL licenses technology to serve advertisements on its Properties and other content as that content is served across the Internet. In addition, SEL may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Properties and elsewhere online, and we use third-party analytics providers to evaluate and provide us with information about the use of the Properties and viewing of our content.

This notice sets forth the disclosures and rights for California Consumers regarding their personal information, as required by the California Privacy Rights Act and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder (“CPRA”). Terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California Privacy Notice have the same meanings given in the CPRA, unless otherwise defined.</p></div> <p><p>  <u> California Consumer Rights. </u> Subject to certain exceptions, as a California consumer, you may have the following rights regarding your CA Personal Information: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Request to Know. </b> Request information regarding what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, and sell, including the right to request that we provide you with the categories and /or specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you;</li><li><b> Request to Delete. </b> Request deletion of the Personal Information we collect about you;</li><li><b> Request to Correct.  </b> Request correction of inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you;</li><li><b> “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information.” </b> Request to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information or the “sharing” of your Personal Information to a third party for cross-contextual behavioral advertising (i.e., targeted advertising). As we do not knowingly collect Personal Information of residents younger than the age of 16, we also do not knowingly sell or share for cross-contextual behavioral advertising their Personal Information.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  “Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.” Under the CPRA, a business must only provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information when Sensitive Personal Information is collected or processed for the purpose of inferring characteristics about a consumer or does not fall under certain statutory exceptions. SEL’s use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information is not used for such purposes and/or falls within the statutory exceptions, and we therefore do not offer this right at this time. </p></p> <p><p>  <b> Verifying Requests. </b> In your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information, or their authorized representative. You must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to it. We can’t respond to your request if we can’t verify your identity. Making such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity. </p></p> <p><p>  We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide and the type of request you are making. When you exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct, we may ask that you provide us with additional information in order to verify your identity and fulfill your request. If we are unable to verify that the individual submitting the request is the same individual about whom we have collected information (or someone authorized by that individual to act on their behalf), we will not be able to process the request.</p></p> <p><p>  Pursuant to the CPRA, we will not require you to verify your identity, beyond asking for the information necessary to complete your request, when you exercise your Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Agents. </b> If you are an authorized representative submitting a request on a consumer’s behalf, please complete the applicable request per the instructions below. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child. We will follow up to request a signed, written permission signed by the individual who is the subject of the request authorizing you to make the request on their behalf. The written permission must state your full legal name, the full legal name of the individual who is the subject of the request, and a clear description of the permission granted. Alternatively, you may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. In either case, please also indicate in your email the nature of your request. The consumer’s identity, in addition to your own, will need to be independently verified in order for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided you permission to submit the request. Please keep in mind that if we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Exercising Your Rights. </b></p></p> <div><p>  <b> Right to Know; Right to Delete; Right to Correct </b></p><p>  If you are a California Consumer and would like to exercise your Right to Know, Right to Delete, and/or Right to Correct, please submit your request at: <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/ae4501a4-318f-4210-bddc-9a8bc984c5a6/e006e4a8-bd41-4340-b9d9-863c15a2532e" target="_blank"> Data Requests; </a> or you may call us toll-free at 1-833-681-9900. </p><p>  For requests to know, in order to have us provide specific pieces of information, we will require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.
