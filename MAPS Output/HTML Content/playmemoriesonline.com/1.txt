your favorite content from a vast array of available content and discover new
services. Sony may collect and consolidate various information about you and

How Sony Corporation, its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Sony”, “we”, “our” or
“us”) may read, collect, use, and/or store information about your use of the
applications and/or online services on Sony’s cloud platform. </p><p>  ii.

this policy?</p></div> <div><p>  Sony
may collect and consolidate various information about you and your interactions
with the following application(s) and/or online service(s) on Sony’s cloud
platform when you use them:</p><p>  About
PlayMemories Online</p><p>  “PlayMemories
Online” is Sony’s cloud storage service for your photos and videos. You can
easily upload your photos and videos, view wherever you are on your various

Entertainment Network unique account identifier and ‘ticket’</p><p>  In
order to use the full function of the PlayMemories Online service, you may need
to sign in to your Sony Entertainment Network Account (“SEN Account”). When you
sign into your SEN Account, you provide your SEN Account ID and password
directly to the relevant Sony Entertainment Network company (as explained in

process independently of us. Once you have successfully signed in to your SEN
Account, your PlayMemories Online application will receive a digital ‘ticket’,
which includes account information assigned to your SEN Account by the relevant
Sony Entertainment Network company (i.e., your SEN Account sign-in
authenticates you so you may use the PlayMemories Online service). This process
may allow for authentication for an extended period of time so you do not need
to sign in to your SEN Account every time you want to access the PlayMemories
Online service for that extended period. </p></div> <div><p>  Registered
