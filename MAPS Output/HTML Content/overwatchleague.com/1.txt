We also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration. In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks.

Your US Privacy Rights </strong> </p></p> <p><p>  Residents of some states have certain rights in relation to their personal information. We describe below the rights that may be available to you, depending on your state of residence. </p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information </strong> </p><p>  You may have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, access to the personal information we have collected about you and information regarding the source of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers to whom we sell, share, or disclose it. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under law. </p><p>  <strong> Right to Request Correction of Your Personal Information </strong> </p></div> <p><p>  You may have the right to request that in certain circumstances we correct personal information that we have collected about you. Some information may be exempt from such requests under law. </p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information </strong> </p><p>  You may also have the right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected from or about you. Some personal information may be exempt from such requests under law. For example, we need certain types of personal information so that we can provide our Properties to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Properties. </p><p>  <strong> Limit Use of Your Sensitive Personal Information </strong> </p></div> <p><p>  California residents have the right to limit our use of their sensitive personal information if we use such personal information to infer characteristics about them. We do not currently use sensitive personal information for such purposes. In some states, we may be required to obtain your consent before collecting your sensitive personal information. </p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Sale and Sharing of Personal Information; Targeted Advertising </strong> </p><p>  Under the laws of some states, consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of personal information or the sharing of their personal information with third parties for targeted advertising (also known as cross-context behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising). </p><p>  We share certain information with third parties who do work on our behalf for the business purposes we describe above. </p></div> <p><p>  We also may allow third-party advertising companies to collect Information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins. These advertising entities use Information they collect to help us provide more relevant advertisements and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy. You can control the sharing of your personal information for targeted advertising through our websites and apps in the following ways: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To set up cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, including third-party advertising cookies, click <a href="#https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/legal/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> here </a>.</li><li>You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for interest-based advertising purposes.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  The personal information collected through these methods is associated with your browser or device, so if you would like to opt out for this information you will need to disable cookies or trackers as described above. Because your opt-out preference is stored in a cookie, if you clear your cookies then we will not recognize your device or your choices, so you must opt out again. You may also disable non-advertising cookies through your browser or device settings. </p></p> <p><p>  In applicable states, where required, OWL recognizes Do Not Track settings and the Global Privacy Control. </p></p> <p><p>  In addition to the opt-outs related to advertising above, we support the applicable state laws by allowing residents to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information for targeted advertising by clicking <a href="/do-not-sell-or-share-my-personal-information" target="_blank"> here </a>.

We will take steps to both verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney. </p></p> <p><p>  Once we have verified your identity (or your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate.
