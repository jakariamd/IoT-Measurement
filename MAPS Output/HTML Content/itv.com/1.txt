Targeted advertising (or interest-based advertising) is when we use your personal information (described in the above table: Registration Data, Usage Information, technical information, location data), and sometimes other information we get from third parties, to create a ‘profile’ of you or your household which we use to promote ITV services and to show you ads for third party products, brands and services which we think may be of interest to you. We may:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>show you marketing and promotions about ITV services on our services or elsewhere online based on what we think may be of interest to you, and</li><li>show you ads about third party products, brands and services you might find interesting on our services, including where any ITV service is provided via a third party platform or device.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For example, where we have information suggesting you would like to hear about great new dramas being shown on ITV we might show you ads on other platforms (e.g. Facebook) or send you an email letting you know about upcoming dramas. Or when one of our advertising customers has information suggesting winter holidays might be of interest to you then we might show you ads about holidays on our services.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> We explain further below about how and why we perform targeted advertising </b></p><p>  <b> Targeting for ITV Promotions </b></p><p>  We have a legitimate interest to promote our TV programmes and other products and services. This ensures ITV is commercially successful and is able to compete against other broadcasters and streaming companies. It enables ITV to maximise our audience ratings and find new users who would love to watch ITV and/or subscribe to or use one of our other services or products.</p></div> <p><p>  We may work with third party advertisers and platforms (such as Facebook and Google) to advertise our products and services to new or relevant audiences, or to exclude an audience from a marketing campaign if we know they are already loyal customers or the campaign is not likely to be of interest to them. For registered users, we do this by providing a protected or hashed ID (for example, taking your registered email address which is then 'hashed' which means it is converted into a string of numbers and/or letters (to help make it more secure) to match the personal information we hold about you with the data the third party may also have because you are a user of their platform or you are in their customer database in order to show you (or exclude you from) the marketing or promotion. This is subject to your permissions with the third party advertiser or the relevant third party platform. You should read and understand the third party's privacy notice and check your privacy settings or controls. </p></p> <p><p>  If you do not want us to use your personal information to include or exclude you from our marketing efforts please go to section 2 “Your Controls”to find out howto change your settings or permissions. </p></p> <p><p>  For registered users and visitors to ITV Services, we may also use third party cookies and pixels to support our marketing efforts. How we do this and how you can control cookies and pixels is explained in section 13 "Cookies and similar technologies" below. </p></p> <div><p>  <b> Targeted Ads </b></p><p>  Most ITV services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for our customers. The more income we generate from selling ads, the more we can invest in new TV programmes and services. We consider we have a legitimate business interest in using information we hold about you to help us promote our own products or services or to sell adverts (for example the adverts that appear during TV programmes you watch live or on demand).  which may be of interest to you or exclude you from seeing ads which may not be useful for you. For example, if you live in Leeds then we would be more likely to show an ad for a local event in Yorkshire - and less likely to see an ad for a local event in London.</p></div> <p><p>  To enable us to deliver targeted ads for our media buyers and advertisers, we may pass an identifier relating to you (which is in the form of some numbers/letters - it doesn’t use your name) and information about you to The Addressable Platform Limited (including Planet V) part of the ITV group, and its technical service providers. </p></p> <p><p>  In addition to showing you ads that may be of interest to you we may also limit the number of the ads you may see. This is called frequency capping. We, our media buyers and advertisers, have a legitimate interest in making sure that you don’t see repetitive or less relevant advertising. </p></p> <p><p>  Sometimes third party companies want to show ads about their products and services to their customers or who are similar to their customers and who are also ITV viewers Those companies, or companies within their group, may share the personal information of their customers with ITV. If you are a customer of one of these companies they should inform you about data sharing at the time they collected your data or before it is shared with ITV. The data that these companies share is matched with our own data so that we can identify their customers. The matching takes place in a secure platform operated by a company called InfoSum.  The data is encrypted before it is shared with Infosum and neither ITV nor the third party can directly identify you nor see or access the other party's data.  Where there is a match your data may be added to a group sharing similar attributes and you will see ads that are shown to  that group. We do not give your personal information to these third party companies.</p></p> <p><p>  See the section below about controlling targeted ads on ITV services. You can also opt out of being included in platforms that match similar audiences by requesting this directly to the other platforms and organisations that hold your data. </p></p> <p><p>  The Addressable Platform Limited (including Planet V; part of the ITV group,) provides advertising technology services to its customers and their group companies (including (i) GroupM UK Limited and its affiliate Finecast Limited; and (ii) Publicis Groupe) to enable them to match against other data they may legally hold, or that they licence for use. That combined information is used to show ads to you in both ITV services and in selected third party publishers (on smart TVs, set top boxes and streaming devices). You can read Planet V privacy policy here: https://www.planet-v.co.uk/privacy-policy.</p></p> <div><p>  <b> How do I control targeted ads in ITV services? </b></p><p>  See section 2 “Your Controls”for the controls available to you on the use of your information for targeted ads. Depending on which device you use (for example smart TVs, set top boxes and streaming devices), you may also control targeted ads you see on those devices by changing the settings available. These controls are managed by the platform or device provider, which might not be ITV. See further info below.</p><p>  <b> How do targeted ads work when I watch ITV channels on a smart TV, set top box or other streaming device? </b></p></div> <span><span>  We have arrangements in place with some of our distribution partners (Sky, BT, You View and Virgin Media) to enable us to personalise the content and viewing recommendations when you use any available ITV service, and deliver targeted adverts you see (by dynamically inserting them) when viewing ITV channels broadcast on their TV services.  To do this we receive an ID which relates to your smart TV, set top box or other streaming device. This ID, together with information about what ITV shows you watch, enables us to create a profile of your household (so that we can identify groups of audiences to show ads on your smart TV, set top box or other streaming device which we think will be of interest or useful to you. We also use this information to personalise content and viewing recommendations in the ITV service (both our streaming service if you are a user - and ITV channels). This will include programmes that may interest you and adverts for products and services that we think you would like to hear about.  See section 2 “Your Controls”on how to opt out of these targeted ads. </span></span> <p><p>  We may use cookies or similar technologies to support targeted ads - please read section 13 “Cookies and similar technologies” to find out how to manage your preferences.</p></p> <div><h2>  <b> 7.

For example, </p><ul>  <li>maintaining the performance of our services and our recommendations,</li><li>if you ask us to stop sending you marketing communications, we need to keep some information about you to enable us to ensure we stop including you in those marketing activities,</li><li>understanding and managing our business and how it is performing and making business decisions including about new features, products and services,</li><li>complying with our legal or regulatory obligations (for example we may keep your payment information to comply with tax rules)</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>dealing with intellectual property disputes or other breaches, </li><li>resolving complaints</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  When we no longer have a legitimate or lawful need to keep your personal information, we will delete it or anonymise it. </p></p> <div><h2>  <b> 8.

The main transfers take place if: </p><ul>  <li>the UK government has determined the country has an adequate level of data protection, </li><li>standard data protection clauses (which have been ‘adopted’ by the UK government or European Commission) are in place with the service provider or third party, or</li><li>we can rely on one of the specified exceptions. </li></ul></div> <p><p>  We may also take steps to identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we may require the use of:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation (which means making sure personal data can no longer be linked to you without the use of additional information) and</li><li>policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful foreign government or other authority requests.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We review our service providers before we use them and also ensure that they are only allowed to access the information they need to perform the services we request. </p></p> <p><p>  If you want more information, please contact us.</p></p> <p><p>  When you interact with ITV on social media please be aware they may store your personal information outside the UK, usually in the US. As explained above, you should read the privacy notices of the social media platforms you use to understand how they process your personal information. </p></p> <div><h2>  <b> 9. How we keep your personal information safe </b></h2><p>  We're committed to protecting your personal information and keeping it secure, private and confidential. We put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal information. Unfortunately no measures can ever be completely secure. We have implemented various safeguards to protect against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal information in our systems. These include pseudonymisation, encryption, restricting access, and retention policies.</p></div> <p><p>  To protect your user account, we encourage you to:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>use a strong password which you only use for your ITV account,</li><li>never share your password with anyone,</li><li>limit access to your computer and browser,</li><li>log out once you have finished using the ITV service on a shared device, and</li><li>make sure your details are up to date so information we send you does not fall into the wrong hands (you can update your details online or by contacting us).</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If other individuals have access to your ITV account (for example if you've given them permission to use your account on a shared device), then they can access personal information, controls and the ITV service available in your account.</p></p> <p><p>  It's your responsibility to only provide individuals with permission to use your ITV account where you are happy to do so and to let them know that ITV will collect Usage Data which you will have access to as part of your account. Anyone else's use of your ITV account or profiles may impact your personalised recommendations.</p></p> <div><h2>  <b> 10. Children, Kids Profiles and CiTV </b></h2><p>  Please see the terms and conditions for the relevant ITV service which will specify any applicable minimum age. We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under this minimum age. </p><p>  On some of our ITV services, you may be able to set up a Kid’s Profiles for a child under the age of 16. These profiles have been designed to ensure only content in the children’s genre can be accessed.</p><p>  We collect the following limited information on Kid’s Profiles which is stored under the adult account holder:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>how the streaming service is accessed - for example your IP address, device type and identifier, operating system and browser version,</li><li>viewing history,</li><li>which advertisements you have been shown and the length of time an advertisement was displayed and if you interact with them,</li><li>location data from your IP address or by accessing global positioning functionality on your device (e.g. GPS),</li><li>how you move around the streaming service. We use this information to improve our products and services,</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>to ensure you comply with our terms and conditions and/or otherwise as required by law.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We do not collect any additional personal information about your child when using the Kid’s Profile. We do not show targeted ads on the Kid’s Profile. However, we will store the name you have chosen for your Kid’s Profile so it can be displayed on your profiles page. </p></p> <p><p>  If you're a parent of a child under 16 and become aware that your child has provided personal information, please contact us. We may decide to delete the account for that child. </p></p> <p><p>  When using a shared device to access the ITV service, be careful about playing or recommending any TV programmes to individuals under 16 years old which could be inappropriate for them. You may choose to activate Parental Controls when you share your device or when using the Kid’s Profile.</p></p> <div><h2>  <b> 11. Your rights </b></h2><p>  Data Protection law gives rights to individuals over their personal data. Some rights only apply when we use a certain <b> legal basis </b> to process your personal information. We have set out your rights below, when they apply (such as the legal basis required) and how to use them. We explain each legal basis in section 4 “Why we use your personal information”.</p><p>  <b> It’s your right to … </b></p><ul>  <li><b> be informed </b> of the personal information we collect and process about you and how we do that (this notice does this).</li><li><b> request access </b> to the personal information we process about you by making a ‘Data Subject Access Request’. To do this, please email us at myprivacy@itv.com and include in your email: </li><li>that you are requesting a copy of your personal information, and</li><li>full details of what you require. </li></ul></div> <p><p>  We may ask you to give us proof of your identity before we can deal with your request.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><b> request that we correct or update </b> your personal information where it’s wrong, out of date or incomplete. Please let us know and we will put it right.</li><li><b> request that we delete or erase </b> some of your personal information. For example, you can ask us to erase information:</li><li>that we no longer need for the purpose it was collected for,</li><li>that we process based on your consent, and you withdraw your consent,</li><li>when you object to direct marketing, or</li><li>when you make a justified objection (more info below).</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  There are situations where ITV is unable to delete your personal information, for example when:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>it’s still necessary to process the personal information for the purpose we collected it,</li><li>ITV’s interest in using it overrides your interest in having it deleted. For example, where we need to protect our services from fraud,</li><li>we have a legal obligation to keep it, or</li><li>we need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. For example, if there’s an unresolved issue relating to your account.</li><li><b> Request that we restrict and/or stop our processing </b> (temporarily or permanently) of all or some of your personal information. You can do this if:</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>your personal information is inaccurate,</li><li>our processing is unlawful,</li><li>we do not need your information for a specific purpose, or</li><li>you object to our processing and we are dealing with your objection request.</li><li><b> Object to us processing </b> your personal information. You can do this if we are processing it:</li><li>on the legal basis of legitimate interests (we will consider if your rights outweigh our interests and if they do, then we will either restrict our use of your information or delete it), or</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>for direct marketing.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  To exercise your right to object:</p><ul>  <li>you can use available controls on the relevant ITV service to switch off or adjust some features which process your personal information. For example, you can switch off ‘Targeted Ads’ in your Data Permissions settings, or </li><li>where the ITV service does not provide a control, contact us to object.</li><li><b> Request us to move a copy  </b>of your personal information that you provided to us to another provider or to give you a copy in a machine readable format (this right is known as ‘<b> data portability </b>’). You can request us to do this when we automatically process your personal information on the legal basis of consent or performance of contract. However, it may not be technically possible and/or feasible for us to comply with your request.   </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making </b> (decisions without human involvement), including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect. ITV does not carry out this type of automated decision making.</li><li><b> Withdraw your consent </b> to us collecting or using your personal information at any time. You can do this if we are processing your personal information based on your consent. To withdraw consent you can adjust the relevant control or contact us.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Right to lodge a complaint </b>. If you do have any questions or complaints then you should contact us first so we can try to put things right for you. If you are not happy with our response you have the right to contact the Information Commissioner’s Office, please visit the ICO website (www.ico.org.uk)  or write to ICO, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, SK9 5AF or call 0303 123 1113. </li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  <b> 12. Changes to how we use your information </b></h2><p>  We may occasionally update this Information. You should check it out from time to time.  If we make a significant change to how we use your information, we will let you know in advance. </p></div> <div><h2>  <b> 13. Cookies and similar technologies we may use </b></h2><p>  This section describes how cookies and similar technologies are used to support ITV services and the controls which may be available to you. These are used on our websites, apps and other digital platforms (for example on your connected TV). There are also other technologies we may use (which do not use cookies to store or access information on your device) - see section 3 above which explains when we collect technical information automatically.</p></div> <div><p>  <b> What are cookies and similar technologies?  </b></p><ul>  <li>cookies are small text files stored by your browser (a browser is the software on your device which enables you to access the internet). The cookie stores a unique identifier (a string of random characters) so that your browser can be singled out from other browsers to show you the information you want (for example, the episode of the programme you want to watch on our streaming service). And it is often used to link your browser to databases that hold data about your online behaviour and inferred interests, along with other data such as your IP address or device ID, </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>other types of storage, such as local or “HTML” storage. Some ITV services use local storage technologies that are similar to cookies but enable larger amounts of data to be stored. This means we can store information like your preferences and viewing history on your device rather than on our own systems, and</li><li>pixels are embedded code to recognise your browser and record your interactions with emails, online content or ads.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  From now on we will refer to these technologies collectively as ‘cookies’. Cookies are typically used by websites or where apps have embedded web browsers which allow them to access the internet.  </p></p> <div><p>  <b> What about apps? </b></p><p>  Mobile apps do not use cookies the way websites and mobile web browsers do. Most ITV apps use software development kits (also known as SDKs) which are building blocks and are part of our apps. These SDKs are stored on your device when you download the app. Instead of using browser cookies, we either collect a unique identifier or ID associated with your device, such as the device Advertising ID (a random and resettable ID on your device), or we generate an ID from your registration/login data and we may take these IDs and associate them with other data such as your viewing data or usage information when you access and use an ITV service. This data is used in the same way as cookies; for example, to analyse, test different versions of layouts and content, and improve services, to deliver a personalised viewing experience, and to show you ITV promotions or other marketing and advertising (if the ITV service is funded by advertising or contains advertising). </p></div> <div><p>  <b> Why do we use cookies and what types of cookies do we use? </b></p><p>  <b> Essential: </b> these cookies are necessary for ITV services to work. Without these cookies, we can’t provide you with our core functionalities and associated services such as login and security, and help to improve your experience and so these are not optional. Some of these types of cookies also provide you with features which you choose to use. They also help with the following:</p><ul>  <li>when you log in (or for ITV Vote - verify your mobile phone number), we’ll remember you so you don’t have to sign in (or verify) every time,</li><li>to keep our sites and apps and your personal information secure, especially when you make any payments,</li><li>we’ll track the content you’ve watched so that we can pay companies who have licensed us the rights to show you those programmes and so we can report aggregate usage for internal or external reporting purposes (for example, to broadcast or financial regulators or other bodies),</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>we will measure which adverts you’ve seen so you don’t have to watch the same ads again and again within a specific period of time,</li><li>we may test different versions of our website or app layouts or content to understand which performs best for user experience,</li><li>we collect anonymous data on how you use ITV services in order to make improvements and to identify and fix any technical issues.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use Google Tag Manager which supports our use of Google Analytics and allows us to manage our use of other types of cookies. Google Analytics is an analytics and measurement service provided by Google. Google Analytics sets a cookie in order to evaluate use of ITV services where we have implemented it, and compile a report for us. Google Analytics records visits to our website to help us know:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>the date and time of visits and which other sites visitors have come from,</li><li>how many active users we have at any given time, </li><li>which parts of our services are most popular (so we can find out what programmes are watched and so we know which are popular amongst all our viewers), </li><li>what browsers are used (so we can maximise compatibility), </li><li>the country or region where our users are located, </li><li>we may also use this cookie to derive demographics and interests data for analytics purposes only. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You can find out more about how Google uses data  at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-GB" target="_blank"> https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-GB </a>.

These other companies might use cookies to provide these services or otherwise enable them to track your use of their services. Please see their cookies policy to find out more about. If you choose not to consent to these cookies then some features or functions on the ITV service may not work.</p></p> <p><p>  <b> Targeting for ITV Promotions: </b> These cookies are used to build a profile of your viewing behaviour and interests to show you ads, about<b>  ITV products and services </b> that we think you will like, in ITV Services and also on other websites and services (including social media platforms) that you use. We use cookies which generate unique identifiers of your browser and/or device so that we can identify you or people who are similar to you who are also using other platforms or services (for example social media). This helps us to understand whether our marketing or promotions on third party platforms or services have been effective and to know whether people who see our marketing or promotions then come to use ITV Services. We then use this information to help us make decisions about which third party platforms or services we should advertise on. These cookies also allow us to understand the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional emails (for example, whether you viewed or clicked on one of our emails and what you might have clicked on next). </p></p> <p><p>  You can opt out of targeting cookies but you will still see ads, but they may be less interesting or relevant for you. </p></p> <p><p>  We do not have any control over the the data collection and use practices of third party platforms.
