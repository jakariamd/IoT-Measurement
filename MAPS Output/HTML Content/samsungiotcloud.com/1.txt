We created this Privacy Notice to make sure you understand how we collect and use your personal information.</p><p>  Our Privacy Policy at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank"> https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy </a> also applies to your use of SmartThings. Our Privacy Policy contains more information about how we use your data. It also includes information about your rights and how to contact us. Please read our Privacy Policy in addition to this Privacy Notice. However, this Privacy Notice shall always prevail over the Privacy Policy in relation to how we use your information for SmartThings.</p></div> <div><p>  <u> WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? </u></p><p>  Through SmartThings, Samsung obtains and maintains information about you in various ways.</p><p>  <u> Information You Provide Directly </u></p><ul>  <li>Your Account Information: SmartThings will collect your account information, which is necessary to initiate and provide the SmartThings service to you. This will include information such as your name, Samsung account ID, email address, mailing address, phone number and username. Your account information will not only include the information that you enter in the SmartThings app to create a Samsung account, but also the account information in apps from third-party service partners which you allow to access SmartThings, as well as any devices registered to your Samsung Account (such as any mobile devices).</li></ul></div> <div><p>  <u> Information About Your Use of SmartThings </u></p><p>  In addition to the information you provide, we will collect information about your use of our SmartThings through software on your devices and by other means. We will collect:</p><ul>  <li><strong> App </strong> <strong> Usage Information </strong>: We will collect your usage information created during your use of the SmartThings app, such as app logs, groups, rules and location names, your interactions with SmartThings (such as the app and web pages you visit and features you use), along with other configuration information.</li><li><strong> Home IoT Device Information </strong>: As SmartThings may consist of several sets of home appliances, sensors, SmartThings hubs, smart bulbs, products, home monitoring cameras and other devices connected to SmartThings (“Home IoT Devices”), SmartThings will also collect usage information related to your Home IoT Devices, such as Home IoT Device model, name, group name or nickname, location name and other settings assigned to the device, event and event settings (for example, if you set up a schedule reminder to display on your Home IoT Device), the network connection information(including SSID and password) and the surrounding network environment information, device country code, device network operator, OS version, IP address and IMEI, sensor and configuration data, error and malfunction logs, device identifier (e.g. ICCID) and the device and automation name. The main purpose for processing such information is to provide the service you have requested (though it may also be used for data analysis and to enable us to provide customized marketing communications, where you have given us your separate consent). Examples relating to the use of your information to provide you with the service are set out below. For example, when you use a motion sensor, SmartThings will collect the information detected by the sensor (such as logs indicating movement in your home, that the lights have been automatically turned on or off, or if there is unexpected movement in your home) to enable an alert to be sent. SmartThings will also collect the usage/settings information of home appliances connected to SmartThings, if you turn on these features. For example, the temperature information inside your refrigerator, the time information showing how long you have used the air conditioner, and other information about the functions you have selected will be collected not only to display the device/appliance status through your app, but also to understand your use of Home IoT Devices and thus continue to improve the our services. In addition to the above-mentioned personal data, we will collect your dump logs, which are files listing the technical errors of your devices. These dump logs will only be used to provide you with the technical assistance you need and to improve the SmartThings app and Home IoT Devices.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Video and Audio Clips Recorded by the Home Monitoring Camera </strong>: If you connect video or audio recording devices to SmartThings, SmartThings will collect the video or audio clips recorded by such device, based on your choices, to provide the service you request in the SmartThings app.</li><li><strong> Images, video clips </strong>: If you choose to share your images or video clips (not recorded by the Home Monitoring Camera) stored on your device with other SmartThings users or devices, SmartThings will collect the images and video clips.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Voice Information </strong>: If you use voice commands to control SmartThings, information about your conversations, including voice commands, will be relayed through SmartThings servers to process your command.</li><li><strong> Location Information </strong>: If you consent to the collection and use of location data, your geolocation data is collected to provide the service or feature that requires location information.
