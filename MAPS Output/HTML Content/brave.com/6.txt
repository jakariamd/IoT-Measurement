<div><h1>  Publishers & Creators Privacy Policy</h1><p>  Read this document to learn how we use data for publishers and content creators. In this policy “we”, “us”, etc. refers to Brave Software Inc.</p><p>  (To learn how we use data to operate this website and other Brave sites, forums, and communications, see the <a href="/privacy/website/" target="_blank"> Website Privacy Policy </a>. To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see the <a href="/privacy/browser/" target="_blank"> Brave Browser Privacy Policy </a>).</p></div> <div><h2>  Basic Attention Token Tips </h2><p>  If you are a creator who has a YouTube or Twitch account, or owns a website, Brave has a function that allows you to automatically receive gifts of BAT from Brave itself, and from your visitors. Brave tallies BAT donations to each website and channel (i.e. YouTube channel, Twitch channel, etc.) anonymously.</p><p>  Contributions to creators that have not signed up with Brave will be reserved on the device. No data about these creators or the attention spent on their sites will be transmitted to us at Brave. The data and all of the logic surrounding it will be entirely “client-side” (i.e. on the device only).</p></div> <p><p>  To collect Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) you must <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/" target="_blank"> create a Brave Rewards account </a> on this site. This involves entering your name, email address, and phone number. It is also necessary to demonstrate that you are the owner of the site(s) or channel(s) for which you receive BAT. This is done by providing information from your web server or DNS provider. We may authenticate your credentials with the site that hosts your channel. In addition to authenticating your credentials with the site that hosts your channel, we will also check your email address at <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank"> https://haveibeenpwned.com/ </a> to determine if it has been compromised to help protect against fraud. We rely on legitimate interests to conduct this check.</p></p> <p><p>  Before you can redeem BAT you will have to connect your Brave Rewards account to Uphold or Gemini, a payments service. Uphold or Gemini, based on your selection, will then tell us whether your account is in good standing, the list of currencies you have configured, and your preferred currency.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Security </strong></p><p>  We record IP addresses when requests are made to identify & prevent fraud and to protect the integrity of the service. We also monitor how the account is used, for anti fraud and to maintain the reliability and performance of the service.</p></div> <div><h2>  E-mail </h2><p>  If you ask us to keep in touch with you by email, we will use SendGrid or MailChimp based in the United States to help us contact you. The processing of personal data on our behalf is subject to a range of measures to help safeguard your personal data including the use of EU standard contractual clauses. Every email we send this way will also include an unsubscribe link.</p></div> <div><h2>  Minimum age to join Uphold or Gemini </h2><p>  The <a href="https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043653091-What-is-the-minimum-age-to-join-Uphold-" target="_blank"> minimum age </a> to join Uphold is 18 years old.
