        </p></p> <p><p>  Forgetful Browsing is similar to, but more powerful and protective than, popular browsing extensions and private browsing modes. It's another example of Brave offering the most powerful privacy features of any popular browser.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  New versions of Brave will hide—and, where possible, completely block—cookie consent notifications. Brave's approach is distinct and more privacy-preserving than similar systems used in other browsers.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  Brave's new system STAR protects user privacy by ensuring the data users contribute are never unique to that user. This property, sometimes called k-anonymity, ensures that the data collector can only see a submitted value if the same value has also been submitted by some number of other users.</p></p> <p><p>

Starting with version 1.39, Brave randomizes how your browser informs sites of what language(s) you’ve set as default, and what fonts you have installed on your system.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  Brave has identified a new category of tracking vulnerability, forms of which are present in all browsers. We call this category of attack “pool-party” attacks because the attack uses collections (or “pools”) of limited-but-shared resources to create side channels.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  Brave is releasing additional protections against certain forms of bounce tracking. We call these new protections "debouncing". As of desktop version 1.32, Brave will protect users against bounce tracking by recognizing when the user is about to visit a known tracking domain, skipping visiting the tracking site all together, and instead directly navigating the user to the intended destination.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  Starting in version 1.31, Brave will support custom filter list subscriptions, allowing users to further control how unwanted network requests and in-page elements are blocked in Brave. This work is part of Brave’s goal of providing best-of-breed content filtering tools, and keeping people in control of their Web browsing.</p></p> <p><p>

Common examples of permission-protected browser capabilities include web cameras, microphones, location information, and motion sensors, among others.</p></p> <p><p>

This post discusses a recent technique trackers use, CNAME cloaking, and a new feature in Brave that keeps Brave users protected.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  Brave now protects users from being fingerprinted by making them appear subtly different to each website. Browser fingerprinting protection is available today in our Nightly version. These new protections both provide the strongest fingerprinting protections of any popular browser, and work without introducing bothersome permission prompts or breaking websites.</p></p> <p><p>

        </p></p> <p><p>  Problem: Blocking Trackers Sometimes Breaks Sites. One of many ways Brave protects your privacy on the Web is by blocking requests to trackers. By blocking these requests, Brave prevents you from being followed around the Web, and from ad companies, data brokers, and other privacy-harming parties from recording your online activity.</p></p> <div><h4>  Resources</h4></div> <div><h4>  Privacy policy</h4></div> <div><h4>  Browser</h4></div> <div><h4>  Company</h4></div> <div><h4>  Social media</h4></div> <div><h4>  Products</h4></div> <div><h4>  Contact</h4></div> <div><h5>  Support</h5></div> <div><h5>  Advertising</h5><span>  Please only use this email address if you are interested in purchasing advertising with Brave.
