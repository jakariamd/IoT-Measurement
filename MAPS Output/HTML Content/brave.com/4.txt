<div><h1>  Brave Websites, Forums, and Email Privacy Policy</h1><p>  Read this document to understand how Brave Software (“us”, “we”, “Brave”, etc.) use personal data to operate its websites, forums, communications and the Brave Merch Store. To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see the <a href="/privacy/browser/" target="_blank"> Brave Browser Privacy Policy </a>. To learn how we use data for publishers and creators, see the <a href="/privacy/publishers-creators/" target="_blank"> Publisher Privacy Policy. </a></p></div> <div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Brave websites are hosted on infrastructure we operate, and on infrastructure operated on our behalf by Amazon, Heroku (a Salesforce company), and Fastly. Fastly’s infrastructure is designed to be as close to you as possible — probably in the same country as you, though this is not guaranteed. The rest of this infrastructure is located in the United States, which is where information is processed and stored only for as long as necessary in order to provide services to you and support Brave in doing so. We take a range of technical and organisational measures to safeguard any personal data processed including the use of EU standard contractual clauses. Wherever possible we try not to process personal data. <a href="#websites-detail" target="_blank"> See data processing details </a>.</p></div> <div><h2>  Community forums </h2><p>  Brave provides two forums by which you can post feedback and comments on Brave’s services and publicly communicate with other Brave users - <a href="https://community.brave.com" target="_blank"> community.brave.com </a> and <a href="http://forum.batcommunity.org" target="_blank"> forum.batcommunity.org </a>. While Brave runs these forums, they are hosted on our behalf by the platform provider, Discourse.</p><p>  Use of our forums is subject not only to Brave’s privacy policy but also <a href="https://www.discourse.org/privacy" target="_blank"> that of Discourse </a>. In a nutshell, your personal data will be used to operate and improve the forum and to provide customer service and support. Please do read the privacy policies.</p></div> <p><p>  We automatically capture and keep the IP address of all server requests but for no more than 30 days. You can access or delete your forum account (and related data) in the “preferences” panel at community.brave.com. <a href="#forums-detail" target="_blank"> See data processing details </a> for more information about what data we use and why.</p></p> <div><h2>  BAT Ambassadors </h2><p>  BAT Ambassadors is a volunteer-based <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/lhocy6/bat_ambassadors_help_us_take_bat_to_the_next/" target="_blank"> program </a> that champions Brave’s Basic Attention Token, and fosters communities of BAT fans worldwide.</p><p>  Individuals who want to become BAT Ambassadors must apply by completing our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfscRNnZVVll_zOB3fLYK7WHLvIhlLeKRbn22eUup27o8GV5w/viewform" target="_blank"> interest form </a>.

Brave does not track people on Facebook, Google, or Twitter, or use any kind of in-app or Brave-server post-install tracking. See data processing detail. These ads link to pages on a separate website run by a company called Unbounce on Brave’s behalf, on servers based in the EU. <a href="#facebook-google-twitter" target="_blank"> See data processing details </a>.</p></div> <div><h2>  Children </h2><p>  Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the website, sign up for email updates, join the community forum, or send Brave any other information. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has interacted with the website, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@brave.com" target="_blank"> privacy@brave.com </a>. In that case, we will do our best to remove all related records.</p></div> <div><h2>  Support </h2><p>  You can submit a support enquiry to Brave by clicking here: <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank"> https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/requests/new </a>.
