signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of
differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is
not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or
whether they are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard
concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such

"do-not-track" (DNT) settings in your web browser. If and when a
final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to
these signals.</p></div> <div><h1>  6. Social Media</h1><p>  We maintain a presence on several social networking and

to that information as well. In addition, some providers of third-party social
media or blogging platforms we utilize their own privacy policies which explain
how the third parties that provide them may collect, use and protect your

an account with such platform providers directly). By using social features,

or to limit our use of it;</span><p>       
</p><span>  Deletion: in certain circumstances,
you can request a right "to be forgotten" (this is a right to have
your information deleted or our use of your data restricted). We will honor
such requests unless we have to retain this information to comply with a legal
obligation or unless we have an overriding interest to retain it;</span></div> <div><p>       
</p><span>  Portability: in certain
circumstances, exercise the right to data portability (this is a right to
obtain a transferable version of your personal information to transfer to
another provider); and</span><p>       
</p><span>  Consent Management: where we rely on
consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw consent at any time.
You do not have to provide a reason for your withdrawal where processing is
based on consent.</span><p>  If you are a resident of the EEA and you wish to access,
change or delete personal information we hold about you, you may contact us </p></div> <div><span>  by completing this </span><span>  form</span><span>  . If we change or
delete your personal information or if you decline to actively share certain
personal information with us, we may not be able to provide you with our
Services or some of the features and functionality of our Services. In
addition, you may contact </span><span>  us</span><p>  to
request that we not disclose your personal information to third parties (other
than those that are acting as our agent to perform tasks on our behalf, such as
data processors).</p></div> <span><span>   Keep in mind, we may
reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if
it may infringe on the rights and freedoms of another person. For example, we
may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of
personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide
our service to you anymore.</span></span> <p><p>  For your protection, we may require proof of identity and
verification before we can answer the above requests.</p></p> <div><p>       
</p><span>  Legal basis for
processing data</span><p>  In this section, we identify the legal grounds on which we
rely to process personal information.</p><p>  In some cases, we have a legitimate interest to process the
personal information that we collect, such as to develop, administer and
support our products and services; to operate, evaluate and improve our
business; to facilitate and manage engagement programs; to promote research; to
support our recruitment activities; or to facilitate a Corporate Transaction
(including a sale of assets or merger or acquisition).</p></div> <p><p>  In other cases, we process personal information to fulfill
our contracts with business partners, such as third parties that distribute our
products. </p></p> <p><p>  It may also be necessary for us to process personal
information to establish, exercise or defend against fraud, illegal activity,
and claims and other liabilities, including by enforcing the terms and
conditions that govern the services we provide.</p></p> <p><p>  Our processing of certain information may be necessary to
comply with our legal obligations, and for reasons of public interest, such as
with respect to adverse </p></p> <div><span>  events</span><span>   and product
safety reporting. </span><p>  We may also process personal information as specifically
permitted by applicable legal requirements.</p><p>  If we rely on consent for the processing of your personal
information, we will seek such consent at the time we collect your personal
information. </p><p>       
</p><span>  International
data transfers</span><p>  We may transfer your personal information to countries other
than the country in which the data was originally collected for the purposes
described in this Privacy Notice. For example, if you are located outside of
the United States, we may transfer your personal information to the United
States, where Daily Burn is headquartered. The countries to which we transfer
personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country
in which you initially provided the information. When we transfer personal
information across borders, we consider a variety of requirements that may
apply to such transfers.</p></div> <p><p>  Specifically, we may transfer personal information from the
European Economic Area to:</p></p> <div><p>       
</p><span>  Countries that the European
Commissions has deemed to adequately safeguard personal information,</span><p>       
</p><span>  Pursuant to the recipient’s
compliance with standard contractual clauses (also known as Model Clauses),
EU-US Privacy Shield, or Binding Corporate Rules,</span><p>       
</p><span>  Pursuant to the consent of the
individual to whom the personal information pertains, or</span><p>       
</p><span>  As otherwise permitted by applicable
EEA requirements.</span></div> <div><h1>  8.</h1><span>  
Information for Residents of California: Your California Privacy Rights</span><p>  If you are a California resident,
the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may provide you with notice and
other rights regarding our use of your personal information that are in
addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. The CCPA Notice applies
to “Consumers” as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA rights
as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights. </p></div> <span><span>  See Sections 1 - 4 above to learn what
information we collect from you and how it is collected, used and shared.</span></span> <div><p>       
</p><span>  Access to Information and Data Portability Rights</span><p>  You have the
right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for
any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request
date:</p><p>       
</p><span>  The categories of personal information we have
collected about you.</span><p>       
</p><span>  The categories of sources from which we
collected your personal information.</span><p>       
</p><span>  The business or commercial purposes for our
collecting or selling your personal information.</span></div> <div><p>       
</p><span>  The categories of third parties to whom we have
shared your personal information.</span><p>       
</p><span>  The specific pieces of personal information we
have collected about you.</span><p>       
</p><span>  A list of the categories of personal information
disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure
occurred.</span><p>       
</p><span>  A list of the categories of personal information
sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred.</span></div> <span><span>   If we sold your personal information, we will
explain:</span></span> <div><p>    
</p><span>  The categories of your personal information we
have sold.</span><p>    
</p><span>  The categories of third parties to which we sold
personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third
party.</span><p>  You have the
right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a
twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the
period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p><p>       
</p></div> <div><span>  Data Deletion Rights</span><p>  Except to the
extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete
your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are
maintaining.</p><span>   Note also that we are not
required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly
from you.</span><p>       
</p><span>  Exercising Your Rights</span><p>  To make a request for access, portability or
deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click </p></div> <div><span>  here</span><span>   or mail your request to
Daily Burn, Inc., 47-10 Austell Place, Suite #303 Long Island City, NY 11101, Attn: Legal
Department.</span><span>   California Consumers may
exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements
of the CCPA.</span><span>   We cannot respond to your
request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal
information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an
identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”).</span></div> <div><p>  The Verifiable Consumer Request must:</p><p>       
</p><span>  Provide sufficient information that
allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
personal information or an authorized representative; and</span><p>       
</p><span>  Describe your request with
sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond
to it.</span><p>  Some personal information we maintain about
Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about
the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s
personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous
browser ID).</p></div> <span><span>   As required by the CCPA, we
do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer
Requests.</span></span> <span><span>   If we cannot comply with a
request, we will explain the reasons in our response.</span></span> <p><p>  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to
identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store,
disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy
rights requests.</p></p> <span><span>   We will typically not
charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable
fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive,
unfounded, or overly burdensome.</span></span> <p><p>  We do not knowingly “sell” personal information
that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of “sell” in the
CCPA, and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a
do not sell request.</p></p> <span><span>   There is not yet a
consensus as to whether our use of certain tracking technologies may constitute
a “sale” of your PI as defined by the CCPA. See our </span></span> <div><span>  Cookie Policy</span><span>   and </span><span>  Section 9 <i> Online Privacy Choices
and Rights </i></span><p>  to learn more about your choices.</p><p>  We will not discriminate against you in a manner
prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.</p><span>   However, we may charge a different price or
rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent
that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.</span><span>   In addition, we may offer you financial
incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your personal
information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in
reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.</span></div> <span><span>   The material aspects of any financial
incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.</span></span> <span><span>   We may add or change incentive programs
and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms
linked to above so check them regularly.</span></span> <p><p>  California's "Shine the Light" law,
Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests
from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to
disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct
marketing purposes. </p></p> <span><span>  We do not currently engage in
the type of sharing covered by that law and so no such list exists. We do not
make any representations concerning third parties that do not collect personal
information directly through our Services. </span></span> <p><p>  To find out more about our “do not track”
practices under Cal. </p></p> <span><span>  Bus. & Prof. Code §
22575, see the “</span></span> <span><span>  Do Not Track Disclosures” section
of this Privacy Policy. </span></span> <p><p>  For additional information on your privacy
choices and rights, see Section 9 of this Privacy Policy. </p></p> <div><h1>  9. Online Privacy Choices and Rights</h1><p>

verification of identity and jurisdiction of residency before we can answer the
above requests.</span></span> <span><span>   If you wish to make such
a request, you may contact us at the applicable mobile application support
email indicated in the “<i> How to Contact Us </i>”
section of this Privacy Policy. If we change or delete your personal

with us, we may not be able to provide you with our services or some of the
features and functionality of our services. Once we have verified that you own
the account, we will honor such requests at our discretion and in accordance
with applicable law.</span></span> <div><p>       
</p><span>  Device
permissions </span><p>  Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types
of device data and notifications, such as camera and microphone as well as push
notifications. Where applicable, you can change your settings on your device to
either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the
display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain
services may lose full functionality.</p><p>       
</p><span>  Uninstall </span></div> <p><p>  You can stop all information collection by the app by
disabling call forwarding and deactivating your account by following the
instructions on the Service’s Settings screen and then uninstalling the app
using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app
from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will
continue to be stored. If you </p></p> <div><span>  reinstall</span><span>   the application on the same mobile device, we will be able
to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</span><p>       
</p><span>  Email </span><p>  If you receive commercial email from us, you may unsubscribe
at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may
also opt-out from receiving commercial email from us, and any other promotional
communications that we may send to you from time to time, by sending your
request to us by the applicable mobile application support email indicated in
the How to Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy. Please be aware that if
you opt-out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify the
nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may
take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may receive
promotional communications from us that you have opted-out from during that
period. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial messages
from us, you will continue to receive transactional or administrative messages
from us regarding the Services.</p></div> <div><p>       
</p><span>  Location

precise real-time location, and in such cases, you may be able to opt out from
further allowing us to have access to such location data by managing your
location preferences in the app and/or on your device. </p><p>       
</p><span>  Notice to Nevada
users</span><p>  Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out
of the “sale” of certain “covered information” (as defined under Nevada law)
collected by operators of websites or online services.   We currently do
not sell covered information, as “sale” is defined by Nevada law, and we do not
have plans to sell this information.  However, if you would like to be
notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the
Act, please contact us </p></div> <div><span>  here</span><span>  .  You are responsible for updating any
change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to
cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other

to use our services from outside the United States, with laws governing data
collection and use that may differ from United States law, note that you are
transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United
States for storage and processing. We may transfer your data from the United
