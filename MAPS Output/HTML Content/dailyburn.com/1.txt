California: Your California Privacy Rights</span><p>  If you are a California resident,
the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may provide you with notice and
other rights regarding our use of your personal information that are in
addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. The CCPA Notice
applies to “Consumers” as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA
rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights. </p></div> <span><span>  See Sections 1 - 4 in our
Privacy Policy to learn what information we collect from you and how it is
collected, used and shared.</span></span> <div><span>  Access to Information and Data Portability Rights</span><p>  You have the
right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any
of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request
date:</p><span>  The categories of personal information we have
collected about you.</span><span>  The categories of sources from which we
collected your personal information.</span><span>  The business or commercial purposes for our
collecting or selling your personal information.</span></div> <span><span>  The categories of third parties to whom we have
shared your personal information.</span></span> <span><span>  The specific pieces of personal information we
have collected about you.</span></span> <span><span>  A list of the categories of personal information
disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure
occurred.</span></span> <span><span>  A list of the categories of personal information
sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred.</span></span> <span><span>   If we sold your personal information, we will
explain:</span></span> <span><span>  The categories of your personal information we
have sold.</span></span> <span><span>  The categories of third parties to which we sold
personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third
party.</span></span> <p><p>  You have the
right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a
twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the
period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p></p> <div><span>  Data Deletion Rights</span><p>  Except to the
extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete
your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are
maintaining.</p><span>   Note also that we are not
required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly
from you.</span><span>  Exercising Your Rights</span><p>  To make a request for access, portability or
deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click </p><span>  here</span></div> <span><span>   or mail your request to
Daily Burn, Inc., 47-10 Austell Place, Suite #303
Long Island City NY 11101, Attn: Legal
Department.</span></span> <span><span>   California Consumers may
exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements
of the CCPA.</span></span> <span><span>   We cannot respond to your
request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your
identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal
information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an
identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer
Request”).</span></span> <div><p>  The Verifiable Consumer Request must:</p><span>  Provide sufficient information that
allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
personal information or an authorized representative; and</span><span>  Describe your request with
sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond
to it.</span><p>  Some personal information we maintain about
Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about
the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s
personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous
browser ID).</p></div> <span><span>   As required by the CCPA, we
do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer
Requests.</span></span> <span><span>   If we cannot comply with a
request, we will explain the reasons in our response.</span></span> <p><p>  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to
identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store,
disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy
rights requests.</p></p> <div><span>   We will </span><span>  typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your
requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request,
if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.</span><p>  We do not knowingly “sell” personal information
that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of “sell” in the
CCPA, and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a
do not sell request.</p><span>   There is not yet a
consensus as to whether our use of certain tracking technologies may constitute
a “sale” of your PI as defined by the CCPA. See our </span></div> <div><span>  Cookie Policy</span><span>   and </span><span>  Section 9 <i> Online Privacy Choices
and Rights </i></span><p>  to learn more about your choices.</p><p>  We will not discriminate against you in a manner
prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.</p><span>   However, we may charge a different price or
rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent
that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.</span><span>   In addition, we may offer you financial
incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your personal
information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in
reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.</span></div> <span><span>   The material aspects of any financial
incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.</span></span> <span><span>   We may add or change incentive programs
and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms
linked to above so check them regularly.</span></span> <p><p>  California's "Shine the Light" law,
Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests
from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to
disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct
marketing purposes. </p></p> <span><span>  We do not currently engage in
the type of sharing covered by that law and so no such list exists. We do not
make any representations concerning third parties that do not collect personal
information directly through our Services. </span></span> <p><p>  To find out more about our “do not track”
practices under Cal. </p></p> <span><span>  Bus. & Prof. Code §
22575, see the “</span></span> <span><span>  Do Not Track Disclosures” section
of this Privacy Policy. </span></span> <p><p>  For additional information on your privacy
choices and rights, see Section 9 of this Privacy Policy. </p></p>
