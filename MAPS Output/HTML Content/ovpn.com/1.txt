<div><h1>  Privacy Policy</h1></div> <div><h2>  General</h2><p>  OVPN is a service provided and developed by OVPN Integritet AB (556999-4469). OVPN Integritet AB is registered in Sweden and will henceforth be referred to as "We", "Us", "Our" and "OVPN".</p><p>  
        OVPN is the privacy friendly VPN provider. As such, our entire infrastructure is built with privacy & security as the core principles.        OVPN does not log any activity when connected to our VPN service. Therefore, we do not know who is connected to our service, what they are doing or when they are doing it. Nothing can be connected to an account:      </p></div> <div><ul>  <li>no logging of traffic</li><li>no logging of timestamps</li><li>no logging of DNS requests</li><li>no logging of IP addresses</li><li>no logging of MAC addresses</li><li>no logging of individual user bandwidth volumes</li></ul><p>  We own every single server used to run our service. All VPN servers run without any hard drives - instead we use tmpfs storage in RAM. Writing permissions for the OpenVPN processes have been removed, as well as syslogs. Our VPN servers do not support physical console access, keyboard access nor usb access.</p></div> <div><h2>  Court orders</h2><p>  OVPN can not provide any activity information or logs about users if a court order was issued asking us to provide that information. As previously mentioned, no information about what our users do when connected is stored.</p><p>  The only information we would be able to provide would be account information detailed further below as well as the method of payment. However, it requires that the court order is for a specific person and that the authorities want to verify if that person has a user account with us.
