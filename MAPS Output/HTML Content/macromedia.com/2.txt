<div><h4>  What are privacy settings?</h4><p>  Applications that run in Flash Player may want to 
            have access to the camera and/or microphone available on your computer. Privacy 
            settings let you specify whether you want applications from a particular website 
            to have such access. Note that it is the person or company that has created the 
            application you are using that is requesting such access, not Adobe (unless 
            Adobe has created the application that wants access to your camera or 
            microphone). </p></div> <p><p>  It is the responsibility of the person or company requesting access to make 
            it clear to you why they want access and how they plan to use the audio or 
            video. You should be aware of the privacy policy of anyone who is requesting 
            audio or video access. For example, see the <a href="/go/privacy" target="_blank"> Adobe privacy policy </a>. Contact the website requesting access for information 
            on their privacy policy.</p></p> <p><p>  It's important to understand that even though this settings panel is part of 
            Flash Player, the audio and video will be used by an application created 
            by a third party. Adobe assumes no responsibility for third-party privacy 
            policies, actions of third-party companies in capturing audio or video on your 
            computer, or such companies' use of such data or information. </p></p> <p><p>  To specify privacy settings for all websites, use the <a href="settings_manager02.html#118539" target="_blank"> Global 
            Privacy Settings panel </a>. To specify privacy settings for individual websites, 
            use the <a href="settings_manager06.html#117645" target="_blank"> Website 
            Privacy Settings panel </a>.</p></p> <div><h4>  What are storage settings?</h4><p>  Applications that run in Flash Player may want to 
            store some information on your computer, but the amount they can store is 
            limited to 100 kilobytes unless you agree to allocate additional space. Local 
            storage settings let you specify how much disk space, if any, applications from 
            a particular website can use to store information on your computer. Note that it 
            is the person or company that has created the application you are using that is 
            requesting such access, not Adobe (unless Adobe has created the application that 
            wants to save the information). It is the responsibility of the person or 
            company requesting access to make it clear to you why they want access and how 
            they plan to use the information they save. You should be aware of the privacy 
            policy of anyone who is requesting access to your computer. For example, see the 
            <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy" target="_blank"> Adobe privacy policy </a>. Contact the website 
            requesting access for information on their privacy policy.</p></div> <p><p>  It's important to understand that even though this settings panel is part of

            third party. Adobe assumes no responsibility for third-party privacy policies, 
            actions of third-party companies in storing information on your computer, or 
            such companies' use of such data or information.</p></p> <p><p>  To specify storage settings for websites you haven't yet visited, use the <a href="settings_manager03.html#117498" target="_blank"> Global 
            Storage Settings panel </a>. To specify storage settings for websites you have 
            already visited, use the <a href="settings_manager07.html#117717" target="_blank"> Website 
            Storage Settings panel </a>.</p></p> <div><h4>  What are security settings?</h4><p>  Adobe has designed Flash Player to provide security settings that do not 
            require you to explicitly allow or deny access in most situations. Over time, as 
            SWF and FLV content have become more sophisticated, Flash Player has also become more 
            sophisticated, offering users additional privacy and security protections. 
            However, you might occasionally encounter older SWF or FLV content that was created 
            using older security rules. In these cases, Flash Player asks you to make a 
            decision: You can allow the content to work as its creator intended, using the 
            older security rules, or you can choose to enforce the newer, stricter rules. 
            The latter choice helps ensure that you only view or play content that meets the most 
            recent standards of security, but it may sometimes prevent older SWF or FLV content
            from working properly.</p></div> <p><p>  When older content runs in a newer version of the player, and Flash Player 
            needs you to make a decision about enforcing newer rules or not, you may see one 
            of the following pop-up dialog boxes. These dialog boxes ask your permission 
            before allowing the older SWF or FLV content to communicate with other locations on 
            the Internet:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>A dialog box might appear alerting you that the SWF or FLV content you are 
                using is trying to use older security rules to access information from a site 
                outside its own domain and that information might be shared between two 
                sites. Flash Player asks if you want to allow or deny such access. 
                In 
                addition to responding to the dialog box, you can use the <a href="settings_manager04.html#117502" target="_blank"> Global 
                Security Settings panel </a> to specify if Flash Player should always ask for 
                your permission, through the dialog box, before allowing access; always deny 
                access, without asking first; or always allow access to other sites or domains 
                without asking your permission.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>(Flash Player 8 and later) If you have downloaded SWF or FLV content to 
                your computer, a dialog box might appear alerting you that the content is 
                trying to communicate with the Internet. Flash Player 8 and later versions do 
                not allow the local SWF or FLV content to communicate with the Internet, by 
                default. 

                Using the <a href="settings_manager04.html#117502" target="_blank"> Global 
                Security Settings panel </a>, you can specify that certain  applications that run in Flash Player
                on your computer may communicate with the Internet. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  To change your security settings or learn more about your options, see the <a href="settings_manager04.html#117502" target="_blank"> Global 
            Security Settings panel </a>.</p></p> <div><h4>  What are protected content playback settings?</h4><p>  Some content on the Internet is protected by the content provider using Adobe Flash Access. To enjoy this protected content, users must first get content licenses from the content provider. These content licenses are automatically downloaded to your computer, for example, when you rent or purchase the protected content. Flash Player saves these licenses on your computer. 

  To manage or deactivate these licenses, use the <a href="settings_manager08.html" target="_blank"> Protected Content Playback Settings panel </a>.</p></div> <div><h4>  What are peer-assisted networking settings?</h4><p>  A website that serves audio and video to your computer can deliver the content with better performance if users who are playing the same content share their bandwidth. Sharing bandwidth allows the audio or video to play more smoothly, without skips or pauses from buffering. This is called peer-assisted networking, since peers on the network assist each other to provide a better experience. Flash Player  only shares bandwidth using peer-assisted networking with your permission.</p></div> <p><p>  If you  enable this option, you are not agreeing to share your bandwidth whenever an application wants to use it. You are only allowing applications to ask you whether you want to share your bandwidth. In most cases, you want to share your bandwidth only when you are using a high-speed Internet connection.</p></p> <p><p>  Note  that sharing your bandwidth increases the amount of data your network provider  delivers to your device. If you pay a flat monthly fee for unlimited network data, using peer-assisted networking won't increase your monthly bill.</p></p> <p><p>  However, if you pay for a limited amount of data  or are unsure how you are charged for network usage, you probably want to disable peer-assisted networking. If you do so, you will never be asked whether you want to share your bandwidth.</p></p> <p><p>  To specify whether or not to use peer-assisted networking, use the <a href="settings_manager09.html" target="_blank"> Peer-Assisted Networking panel </a>.</p></p> <div><h4>  If I've already set privacy and disk space options in my 
            browser, do I need to do it again?</h4><p>  You may be aware that some websites work together with your browser to store 
            small amounts of data, called cookies, on your computer for their own 
            use in the future. For example, when you go to a website regularly, it may 
            welcome you by name; your name is probably stored in a cookie, and you can use 
            browser options to determine whether you want cookies or not. You may also have 
            specified in your browser that pages you visit can take up only a certain amount 
            of disk space.</p></div> <p><p>  When SWF or FLV content is being played, the settings you select for Flash Player 
            are used in place of options you may have set in your browser. That is, even if 
            you have specified in your browser settings that you do not want cookies placed 
            on your computer, you may be asked if an  application that runs in Flash Player can store information. 
            This happens because the information stored by Flash Player is not the same as a 
            cookie; it is used only by the  application and has no relation to any 
            other Internet privacy or security settings you may have set in your browser.</p></p> <p><p>  Similarly, the amount of disk space you let the  application use has no 
            relation to the amount of disk space you have allotted for stored pages in your 
            browser. That is, when SWF or FLV content is being played, the amount of disk space 
            you allow here is in addition to any space your browser is using for stored 
            pages.</p></p> <p><p>  No matter how you may have configured your browser, you still have the option 
            to allow or deny the application that runs in Flash Player permission to store the information and 
            to specify how much disk space the stored information can occupy.</p></p> <div><span>  United States <a href="/go/gffooter_choose_region" target="_blank"> (Change) </a></span><span>  Choose your region</span><p>  Americas</p><p>  Europe, Middle East and Africa</p><p>  Asia Pacific</p><p>  Commonwealth of Independent States</p><p>  Copyright © 2023 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
