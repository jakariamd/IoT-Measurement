<div><h2>  Privacy settings</h2><p>  This information applies to Adobe Flash Player on desktop and notebook computers. To change Flash Player settings on mobile devices, visit the <a href="https://settings.adobe.com/flashplayer/mobile/" target="_blank"> Settings Manager for mobile devices </a>.</p></div> <div><h4>  What are privacy settings?</h4><p>  Applications that are running in Adobe Flash  Player may want to
            have access to the camera and/or microphone available on your computer. Privacy
            settings let you specify whether you want applications from a particular website
            to have such access. Note that it is the person or company that has created the
            application you are using that is requesting such access, not Adobe (unless
            Adobe has created the application that wants access to your camera or
            microphone). In the dialog box shown above, [website] represents the name of the
            person or company requesting access. </p></div> <p><p>  It is the responsibility of the person or company requesting access to make
            it clear to you why they want access and how they plan to use the audio or
            video. You should be aware of the privacy policy of anyone who is requesting
            audio or video access. For example, see the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy" target="_blank"> Adobe privacy policy </a>. Contact the website
            requesting access for information on their privacy policy.</p></p> <p><p>  It's important to understand that even though this settings panel is part of
            Flash Player, the audio and video will be used by an application
            created by a third party. Adobe assumes no responsibility for third-party
            privacy policies, actions of third-party companies in capturing audio or video
            on your computer, or such companies' use of such data or information.</p></p> <div><h4>  What happens if I select Allow?</h4><p>  If you select Allow, the application can capture what your camera sees and
            your microphone hears, until you close the application. </p><p>  The application may want to broadcast the video and audio to other people who
            are viewing or hearing the application you are running — for example, during an
            interactive meeting. The application may also be recording the video and audio
            for later playback, so someone who can't attend the meeting can review it later.</p></div> <p><p>  It is also possible that the application wants to make the video and audio
            available only for you to see and hear — for example, to let you know how you look
            and sound while rehearsing a speech. In this case, the application does not
            broadcast or record the video and audio; it simply captures what you are doing
            while you are doing it. </p></p> <p><p>  As discussed in <a href="#117705" target="_blank"> What
            are privacy settings? </a> above, it is the responsibility of the website
            requesting access to make it clear to you why they want access and how they plan
            to use the audio or video. For example, will it be recorded or is it only
            available live? If it will be recorded, who will have access to it in the
            future? Will it be deleted after a certain period of time? The privacy policy of
            anyone who is requesting audio or video access should address these sorts of
            issues.</p></p> <div><h4>  What happens if I select Deny?</h4><p>  If you select Deny, the application does not have access to your camera or
            your microphone. The application will continue running, but may not function as
            intended. Alternately, the application may inform you that it can't continue
            unless you allow access, in which case you can either allow access or close the
            application.</p></div> <div><h4>  What does Remember mean?</h4><p>  If you select Remember, your selection to allow or deny access applies to all
            applications from this website, not just the application that is currently
            running. That is, Flash Player won't ask you again if applications from this
            website can have access to your camera and microphone. </p><p>  If you don't select Remember, your selection to allow or deny access applies
            only while the application is running. That is, if you run this application
            again, or any other application from this website, Flash Player will again ask
            you to allow or deny access to your camera and microphone.</p></div> <div><h4>  How can I redisplay this panel to change my privacy
            settings?</h4><p>  You may want to change your privacy settings if, for example, you selected
            Remember and then want to change your Allow or Deny answer. To redisplay the
            Privacy Settings panel:</p><ul>  <li>Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Macintosh) the application image
                while the application is running.  </li><li>From the context menu, select Settings, and then click the Privacy tab.
                 </li></ul></div> <div><h4>  I don't see the Privacy tab, so I can't display this
            panel.</h4><p>  If your computer or device doesn't support audio or video recording using
            Flash Player, you don't need to allow or deny access, and this panel doesn't
            appear.</p><span>  United States <a href="/go/gffooter_choose_region" target="_blank"> (Change) </a></span><span>  Choose your region</span><p>  Americas</p><p>  Europe, Middle East and Africa</p><p>  Asia Pacific</p><p>  Commonwealth of Independent States</p></div> <p><p>  Copyright © 2023 Adobe Systems Incorporated.
