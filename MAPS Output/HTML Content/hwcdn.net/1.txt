<b> If you are under 16, you will always need to get your parent(s)/guardian(s)
permission before contacting and interacting with us. </b></p></div> <p><p>  We may need to check that your parent(s)/guardian(s) agree that
you will use our Services. As part of this check, we may ask you for your
parent's/guardian's contact details (e.g. email address or telephone number) so
we can then contact them and obtain their consent. 

We may also carry out checks to ensure that the contact details you have
provided for your parent(s)/guardian(s) are your actual parent(s)/guardian(s).
If we find out that you have given us fake details about your parent(s)/guardian(s)
or if we do not get a reply from your parent(s)/guardian(s) within a reasonable
time, we may be incapable to offer our Services to you.</p></p> <div><p>  What type of information we collect</p><p>  We collect two types of data and information from our users. </p><p>          
</p><p>  The first type of information
is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an
individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“<b> Personal
Information </b>”). This includes:</p><p>    
</p><p>  Log-in information</p><span>  : In order to use our Services, you may be required to register/
log-in to the Services. As part of the process, we may collect your name, birthdate,
telephone number and e-mail address. If you are under 16, we may also ask you
for your parent's/guardian's contact details (e.g. email address or telephone
number), so we can then contact them and obtain their consent.</span></div> <div><p>     </p><p>  Activity information</p><span>  : As part of our
Services, we may collect Personal Information which is related to your activity
on the Websites or Apps (e.g. what games have you participated in? what is the
level you have reached? etc.). This information may help us to track and
evaluate your level of English<b> .  </b></span><p>    
</p><p>  Voluntary information</p><span>  : We also collect information which you provide us voluntarily. As
part of our Services, you may provide us with Personal Information which is
related to your place of residence, for the purpose of finding a learning
center near you. Additionally, we collect your information when you respond to
communications from us, contact our support, communicate with us via email or
the Websites or share additional information about yourself or about others
through your use of the Services. </span></div> <div><p>    
</p><p>  Device Information</p><span>  : We may also collect Personal Information from your device,
such as IP address, Geolocation and other online identifiers (i.e. online data
collected from user’s devices, applications and protocols which leave traces
which may be used to identify users). </span><p>    
</p><p>  Content</p><span>  : Members of the Helen Doron Early English Franchise System,
such as learning centers, teachers, etc. (collectively: “<b> HD </b> <b> Members </b>”)
may upload posts or otherwise make available testimonials, photos, blogs,
videos and other content ("<b> Content </b>") on the Services, which
may include your Personal Information. Such Content will only be used by us
under your (or your parent(s)’/guardian(s)’, as applicable) consent. We as well
as other users may see and share the Content, which is publicly available
through the Services and through other platforms. </span></div> <div><p>          
</p><p>  The second type of information
is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to a user(s),
which may be made available or gathered via the user's use of the Services (“<b> Non-personal
Information </b>”). We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the
Non-personal Information was collected.</p><p>   Non-personal Information which is being collected may include
the following: i) your username and password; ii) information on your activity
on the Services (e.g. pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions, timestamps,
etc.); and aggregated usage information and technical information transmitted
by your device, including certain software and hardware information (e.g. the
type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference,
access time and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the
Services; etc.).</p></div> <p><p>  If we combine Personal Information
with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as
Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p></p> <p><p>  We may anonymize or de-identify the
information collected by the Services or via other means so that the
information cannot, on its own, personally identify you. Our use and disclosure
of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to any
restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others
without limitation and for any purpose.</p></p> <div><p>  Cookies and Google Analytics</p><p>  We use cookies and other technologies in our related Services,
including when you visit our Websites or access our Services. </p><p>  A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a
website assign to your device while you are viewing a website. Cookies are very
helpful and can be used for various different purposes. These purposes include
allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enable automatic activation
of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the interaction
between you and our Services quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to
compile statistical data on your use of our Services. </p></div> <div><p>  Our website uses the following types of cookies: </p><p>          
</p><p>  'session cookies'</p><p>  which are stored only temporarily during a browsing session in
order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your device when
the browser is closed; </p><p>          
</p><p>  'persistent cookies' </p><span>  which are read only by our website, saved on your computer for a
fixed</span><p>  period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Such
cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for
example to allow us to store your preferences for the next sign-in;</p></div> <div><p>          
</p><p>  'third party cookies'</p><p>  which are set by other online services who run content on the
page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics companies who
analyze our web access</p><p>  Cookies usually do not contain any information that personally
identifies you, but Personal Information that we store about you may be linked,
by us, to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. You may remove
the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however,
if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our Service may not operate
properly and your online experience may be limited.</p></div> <p><p>  We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect
information about your use of the Services. Google Analytics collects
information such as how often users access the Services, what pages they visit
when they do so, etc. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only
to improve our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to
you on the date you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying
information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of
Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to
use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to
this site is restricted by the</p></p> <div><p>  Google Analytics Terms of Use </p><span>  and the</span><p>  Google Privacy Policy</p><span>  . </span><p>  How we use the information we collect</p><p>  We use and share Personal Information in the manners described
