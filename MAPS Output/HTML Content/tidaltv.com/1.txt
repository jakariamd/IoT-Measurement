</p><span>  NONE</span><span>  

</span><p>  We understand that you may prefer not to take advantage of the benefits of receiving tailored, more relevant advertising. If that is your preference, we provide you with the ability to opt-out of our use of your information to deliver interest-based advertising. Please note that if you choose to opt-out of Videology’s interest-based advertising, it does not mean that you will receive less advertising, or no advertising, when visiting web sites that use our Services to deliver ads to their sites. This just means we will not use information about you to deliver advertising to you and the advertising you receive will not be as relevant and customized to your interests.

</p></p> <p><p>  If you choose to opt-out of Videology interest-based advertising, the browser on your device will request an "opt-out cookie" that will prevent us from matching your device with information related to you and from using such data to deliver targeted advertising to your device’s browser. It will also break the connection for the device that completed the opt-out request from any "<a href="https://videologygroup.com/platform-privacy-policy/#cross" target="_blank"> cross-device linking </a>" which linked the device with other devices you may use. The Videology opt-out cookie <u> must </u> remain on the browser of your device in order for us to recognize you as an opt-out user. If you use multiple devices to access the Internet or multiple browsers you will need to opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising (and cross-device linking) on each device and for each browser. Also, if you change devices or delete cookies from your device you will need to repeat this opt-out process.
                                        
</p></p> <p><p>  Additionally, if you are located in the United States and Videology was using IP Address to identify your device by "household" (as more fully described above, <a href="https://videologygroup.com/platform-privacy-policy/#ip" target="_blank"> click here </a>) and you initiate Videology's opt-out request, the browser on your device will request an "opt-out cookie" that Videology will associate with the IP Address of the device that is requesting the opt-out. Provided you maintain the Videology opt-out cookie on your device, Videology will no longer use information associated with your "household" IP Address to deliver interest-based advertising to you when you are using the browser on that device that requested Videology’s opt-out cookie. This may not, however, immediately prevent continued delivery of targeted advertising to devices that do not use/accept cookies (such as smart TVs and gaming consoles) and for which we may identify a "household" using IP address, which could take up to 30 days to complete an opt-out request.
