Location information</p></p> <p><p>  When you create a Global Player account, we ask what country you’re in so we can comply with the relevant copyright rules according to the country you are in.

What information do we collect about you from other sources? </strong></p></p> <div><p>  We may obtain additional information about you from trusted third parties and public sources:</p><p>  a. to assist us in our marketing, including Online Behavioural Advertising (“<strong> OBA </strong>”) (also known as “personalised advertising”), and to ensure that you receive adverts and other information that is relevant to you. For example, you may have entered a competition or completed a survey/questionnaire on a third-party website and agreed that this data may be shared with other parties, including Global. Alternatively, you may have consented to a third-party placing cookies on your device and sharing this information with Global. We only work with reputable third-party providers and take steps to ensure our providers respect your privacy rights.</p></div> <p><p>  Information provided to us in this way may include details about your demographics, interests, location and other classifications such as gender, age bracket, social grade or hobbies according to your browsing interests. We then use this information to place you in particular groups or segments with other users with similar information (a process known as ‘profiling’ or ‘segmenting’) and may combine this information with other information we hold about you (such as general information, device information and usage Information described in <a href="#section-3-above" target="_blank"> section 3 above </a>) or information we have collected when you signed up as a VIP, so that we can deliver advertising that is relevant based on your interests. For example, if you have been clicking on articles about pop music and listening to our radio stations which play primarily pop music, we may combine this information to understand you have an interest in pop music. As a result, you may be shown more adverts for live pop music events. You can manage personalised advertising settings through our <a href="#Privacy-Manager" target="_blank"> Privacy Manager </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  b. If you log in via Facebook or Twitter and other social media platforms, you will be giving the social media platform permission to share some of your details with us depending on your privacy settings on their site. For example, if your Facebook privacy settings are set to allow it, Facebook will provide us with your public profile which includes your name, email address and profile picture.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5.

Online Behavioural Advertising (<strong> OBA </strong>)</p></p> <p><p>  If you have consented to the placement of non-essential cookies when visiting our websites and using our apps, we will share the personal information we collect via such cookies with third parties such as:</p></p> <p><p>  • potential advertisers who want to deliver their adverts to a particular audience and with agencies acting on their behalf. This will include information about particular segments that we have categorised you in, based on the information we hold about you;</p></p> <p><p>  • social media platforms which may use that data to:
– serve targeted ads; and
– create a lookalike audience in order to target a new audience of people who share similar qualities and may wish to use our products, apps or services; – and</p></p> <p><p>  • other third parties who receive limited amounts of information (such as online identifiers) in order to assess whether you have seen an advertisement and whether you took any action based on that advertisement (such as clicking on a link).</p></p> <p><p>  When we share your personal information in this way, we ask the recipients to only use your information where necessary in order to choose whether to use our OBA services.

The company that provides your smart speaker service shares with us an identifier (in the form of a string of characters) to enable us to do this, but it does not share any other personal data about you with us.
