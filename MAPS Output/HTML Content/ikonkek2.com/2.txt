<div><p>  CNCT
PRIVACY POLICY</p><p>  Updated APR 12, 2017</p><p>  We at </p><span>  CNCT are
committed to protecting your privacy. Our goal is to provide you with a
positive experience on our websites and when using our apps, products and
services, while at the same time keeping your Personal Information, as defined
below, secure. Our privacy practices are described below, as well as in
separate notices given when an app, product or service is purchased or
downloaded (our "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy covers all </span></div> <div><span>  CNCT Products and </span><span>  CNCT
websites. By visiting </span><span>  CNCT websites, using </span><span>  CNCT Products or providing us with your Personal
Information (as defined below), you are accepting and consenting to the
practices, terms and conditions described in this Privacy Policy.</span><p>  CNCT</p><span>   wants to make </span><span>  CNCT
websites easy for you to navigate and </span><span>  CNCT Products
easy for you to use. We are constantly improving </span><span>  CNCT
websites and </span></div> <div><span>  CNCT Products to make them </span><span>  more user-friendly.</span><p>  For ease of reference, we will use the following terms in this Privacy
Policy: "</p><span>  CNCT", "our",
"us" or "we" means </span><span>  CNCT ltd.,
including its global subsidiaries and affiliated companies (including intelliPLUG
and other </span><span>  CNCT's products). "</span><span>  CNCT websites" include all global </span><span>  CNCT
and intelliPLUG websites. "</span><span>  CNCT Products"
includes all products and intelliPLUG branded apps, products and services.</span></div> <div><p>  Types of
Information Covered by This Privacy Policy</p><p>  CNCT</p><span>   may collect both Personal Information and
Non-Personal Information. "Personal Information" means any
information that can be used to identify you. Some examples of Personal
Information include your name, address, email address and phone number. </span><span>  "Non-Personal Information" means information that on its
own cannot be used to identify you. Some examples of Non-Personal
Information include usage data relating to </span></div> <div><span>  CNCT
websites and </span><span>  CNCT Products, language preferences and
</span><span>  CNCT website page views.</span><p>  Information may be aggregated and/or </p><span>  anonymized.
When information is aggregated, it is combined with information about other
customers and users. When information is </span><span>  anonymized,
Personal Information is removed from collected data and the remaining portion
of the data, containing only Non-Personal Information, is repurposed for
internal or external use, such as, for example, to determine how many users of
a particular router include an Internet-enabled television in a home network
environment, or how many users viewed a particular website video or
advertisement. Aggregated information that includes Personal Information is
considered Personal Information until it has been </span></div> <span><span>  anonymized.
</span></span> <span><span>  Anonymized information is considered Non-Personal
Information. In general, usage data collected when you visit </span></span> <div><span>  CNCT websites or use </span><span>  CNCT
Products is both aggregated and </span><span>  anonymized so it does
not identify you personally and is therefore Non-Personal Information.</span><p>  The </p><span>  CNCT websites and </span><span>  CNCT
Products are not directed to, nor does </span><span>  CNCT
knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we
are informed that we have collected the Personal Information of a child under
the age of 13, we will delete that Personal Information from our systems. If
you believe we might have inadvertently collected Personal Information from or
about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at </span></div> <p><p>  privacy@cnctlife.com</p></p> <div><p>  How We Collect

Information</p><p>  Under no circumstances do we rent or sell your Personal Information to
third parties for marketing purposes. We only share your Personal Information with
third parties for marketing purposes if you have granted us permission to do
so. We will ask for your consent, such as by email response, opt-in box or
click through agreement acceptance, before we use or share your Personal
Information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as
otherwise provided by this Privacy Policy. We may share Personal Information in
the following ways:</p></div> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  Within </span><span>  CNCT
for purposes of data processing or storage.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  Within </span><span>  CNCT's
corporate group, including with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies and
divisions, all of </span><span>  whom may use your information for
the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  With business partners, service
vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors to provide a requested
service or transaction, including processing orders, hosting websites, storing
your information, providing email communications on our behalf and providing
customer support. We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount
of Personal Information necessary to complete or provide the requested service
or transaction, and we do not allow third parties to use your Personal
Information for a different purpose than what was disclosed to you.</span></div> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  With service providers, advisors or
other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the
negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion
of our assets. If </span><span>  CNCT merges with or acquires or is
acquired by another entity, Personal Information would be transferred as a
whole to the successor entity.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To comply with the law or legal process
(such as responding to subpoenas or court orders), to comply with government
reporting obligations and to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
claims.</span></div> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To protect our legal rights or those of
others, such as protecting the </span><span>  CNCT brand or
investigating violations of </span><span>  CNCT terms of use,
violations of law, intellectual property infringement, misuse of </span><span>  CNCT websites, fraud or potential threats to personal
safety.</span><p>  In addition, we may share aggregated and </p><span>  anonymized
Non-Personal Information, including usage data about </span><span>  CNCT
Products, with third parties for a variety of purposes, including to analyze
trends about home networking and utility use, to show third parties how their
products could work with </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT Products and to
generally improve home networking. We've taken steps to ensure that this
information cannot be linked back to you and we require third parties to keep
all shared information in its </span></span> <span><span>  anonymized form.</span></span> <p><p>  For certain intelliPLUG and Smart Wi-Fi products, </p></p> <div><span>  CNCT
may provide the opportunity for you to connect and interface </span><span>  CNCT Products with one or more third party products and
services, which will involve the exchange of information from your </span><span>  CNCT Product with the third party product or service. Your
explicit consent and authorization will be required at the time of connection
to the third party product or service, and will be revocable by you at any
time. In some cases, if you purchase, use or download a third party product or
service that connects to a </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT Product, you may
also be subject to such third party's privacy policy. </span></span> <span><span>  CNCT
is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party partners. If you
access a </span></span> <span><span>  CNCT Product through a third party product
in this manner, you consent and agree to the privacy policy of such third
party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and terms of use
of any third party products that connect to </span></span> <span><span>  CNCT
Products.</span></span> <p><p>  Any third parties with whom we share your Personal Information are
required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited
from using it for any other purpose. We will take all reasonable steps to make
sure these third parties comply with the same privacy principles that govern
our collection of your personal information.</p></p> <div><p>  When making purchases on the </p><span>  CNCT website
stores, </span><span>  CNCT uses a payment processor to verify your
payment card information. Your payment card information is passed through to
the payment processor and is not collected or stored by </span><span>  CNCT.
The payment processor is authorized to use this information only to authenticate
your purchase and for no other purpose.</span><p>  Our European website stores are operated by a third-party service
provider, Trojan Electronics Ltd. ("Trojan"). Trojan processes your
Personal Information solely for the purpose of fulfilling orders placed on our </p></div> <span><span>  CNCT website stores in Europe, and in accordance with
European data protection law.</span></span> <div><p>  Marketing</p><p>  You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Information for
marketing purposes. We will inform you (before collecting your Personal
Information) if we intend to use your Personal Information for marketing
purposes, or if we intend to disclose your Personal Information to any third
party for marketing purposes.</p><p>  We will always give you choices about your Personal Information. Some
choices are presented up front in the form of Opt-in notices or acceptance
boxes for marketing to you or sharing your Personal Information with third
parties. In certain cases where permitted by law, we also may give you the
choice to Opt-out. "Opt-out" means you have already chosen to Opt-in,
but you later change your mind. One form of Opt-out is clicking the Unsubscribe
link in a marketing email. This will take you off of our marketing email list. </p></div> <span><span>  CNCT's general policy is to have users Opt-in, rather than
Opt-out, to receive marketing information and to allow the sharing of
information with third parties. Please note that these Opt-in/Opt-out choices
do not apply to the receipt of mandatory website, service or software
communications, such as update or downtime information, or receipt of order or
shipping confirmations on </span></span> <span><span>  CNCT website stores, which
you may receive periodically unless you cancel your service or order or
terminate use of software in accordance with the applicable terms of use or
license agreement.</span></span> <p><p>  If you do not wish to receive direct marketing material from us or a third
party, in addition to following the "Unsubscribe" instructions in a
marketing email, you can send us an email request at </p></p> <p><p>  privacy@cnctlife.com</p></p> <div><p>  New </p><span>  CNCT Products</span><p>  When you purchase and/or download new </p><span>  CNCT
Products, we will only use your Personal Information for the purposes set out (</span><span>  i) in this Privacy Policy and (ii) in any notification
provided to you at the time of purchase or download.</span><p>  Where We Store
Your Information</p><p>  The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at,
various locations globally, including the United States. </p><span>  It
may also be processed by </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT staff or contractors
operating outside your country of residence (including, if you are in Europe,
outside of the EEA, or, if you are in Australia or New Zealand (ANZ), outside
of ANZ) who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be
engaged in, among other things, the </span></span> <span><span>  fulfilment of
your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support
services. We also use cloud-based applications and services to store and
process your Personal Information, which may result in your Personal
Information being stored outside your country of residence (or the EEA or ANZ).</span></span> <p><p>  We will take such steps as are reasonable to make sure we and our service
providers do not breach the privacy principles that govern our collection of
your personal information. By providing your Personal Information to us, you
fully understand and consent to the transfer, processing and storage of
Personal Information outside of your country of residence where data protection
standards may be different, and you consent to disclosure and use of your
Personal Information to overseas service providers who may not fully comply
with the particular laws of your country. Our Privacy Policy and our practices
are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for Personal
Information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws
provide for less protection for your information, </p></p> <span><span>  CNCT
will still handle your information in the manner described in this Privacy
Policy and in conformity with all applicable laws.</span></span> <div><p>  Accessing and
Updating Your Personal Information</p><p>  We need your help in keeping your Personal Information accurate and up to
date, so please notify us of any changes to your Personal Information. You can
access and update your Personal Information and communication preferences at
any time in the following ways:</p><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  By clicking the "Unsubscribe"
link in any email you receive from us.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  By sending an email to </span></div> <p><p>  privacy@cnctlife.com</p></p> <span><span>  .
Please be sure to include your name, email address and specific relevant
information about the information you would like to change or the material that
you no longer wish to receive.</span></span> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  For many </span><span>  CNCT
websites and </span><span>  CNCT Products, by signing in to your
online account located at the URL provided when you signed up for the </span><span>  CNCT website or service.</span><p>  We
will honor your reasonable request to:</p><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  Correct your data if it is inaccurate.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  Transfer your Personal Information to a
third party.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span></div> <span><span>  Delete your Personal Information,
unless we are required to retain it by law.</span></span> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  Provide you with a copy of Personal
Information held on our current records at no charge, or for a reasonable
charge if records must be accessed from backed up or archived records.</span><p>  We will respond to your request promptly upon receipt. We may ask you to
verify your identity before we can act on your request. If your Personal
Information has been disclosed to a third party in accordance with this Privacy
Policy, we will take reasonable steps to notify the third party of any updated
information you provide to us.</p></div> <p><p>  We note again that, if you choose to no longer receive marketing
information from us, we may still communicate with you about other matters,
such as product and service updates for </p></p> <span><span>  CNCT
Products you have purchased and customer support matters.</span></span> <div><p>  Retention of
Personal Information</p><p>  We will only retain your Personal Information to fulfill the purposes for
which it was collected or as required for legitimate business purposes as
described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise as permitted by law.</p><p>  Cookies, Web
Beacons and Other Web Tools</p><p>  We use automatic data collection tools like cookies, embedded web links
and widgets (collectively, "web tools"). These web tools collect
certain information that your browser or your mobile device sends to </p></div> <div><span>  CNCT websites and </span><span>  CNCT
Products, such as computer IP address, browser type and service provider. In
addition, </span><span>  CNCT uses small pieces of code called web
beacons. Web beacons allow a website to transfer or collect information through
a graphic image request. This allows </span><span>  CNCT to collect
information such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of
the referring page you previously visited, what browser or mobile device you
are using, and your display settings. </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT and its
advertising partners use web beacons, for example, to find out if advertising
on </span></span> <div><span>  CNCT websites and other websites that contain </span><span>  CNCT ads is effective, or if certain videos on </span><span>  CNCT websites are being viewed.</span><p>  CNCT</p><span>   may use web tools for the following
purposes:</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To identify the user's country and
language and distinguish you from other users of </span><span>  CNCT
websites.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To save your registration information
for future use on </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT websites and services.</span></span> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To allow customer surveys to appear or
not appear to customers.</span><p>        
</p><span>  To optimize your browsing experience by
preloading certain features </span><span>  of </span><span>  CNCT
websites and services on future visits to make loading times faster and more
efficient.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To understand how you use and interact
with </span><span>  CNCT websites and services.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span></div> <div><span>  To customize and provide you with a
more personal experience when visiting </span><span>  CNCT websites
or our advertising partners' websites or when using </span><span>  CNCT
Products.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To improve </span><span>  CNCT
websites and services.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  To count visitors to </span><span>  CNCT websites and </span><span>  CNCT Products
and analyze website traffic, such as how many visitors have come to the </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT websites from advertisements on advertising partner
websites.</span></span> <div><p>  You
have the following choices regarding </p><span>  CNCT's use of
web tools:</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  You may refuse to accept cookies by
activating the appropriate setting on your browser or mobile device. However,
many features of </span><span>  CNCT websites and </span><span>  CNCT Products may not work as intended if you disable
cookies, and areas that require registration or authentication and </span><span>  CNCT website store transactions will not be accessible.</span></div> <div><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  For some </span><span>  CNCT
Products, you can go into the account settings and select an option that will
remove you from personalized advertising. If you select this option, you will
receive generic advertising as part of these </span><span>  CNCT
Products rather than advertising that has been tailored based on your
preferences.</span><p>  ¡¤</p><span>        
</span><span>  Many advertising companies are members
of the </span><p>  Digital
Advertising Alliance</p></div> <div><span>   or the </span><p>  Network
Advertising Initiative</p><span>   and provide opt-out choices on
their websites.</span><p>  We do not currently respond to web browser "do not track"
signals or other mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of the collection
of information across the networks of websites and online services in which we
participate. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this
Privacy Policy. Visit the following website, </p><p>  www.allaboutdnt.org</p><span>  , for more information on this developing
area.</span></div> <div><p>  In addition to </p><span>  CNCT's use of web beacons on </span><span>  CNCT websites, we allow certain third parties who provide </span><span>  CNCT advertising on their websites to use their own web
beacons within </span><span>  CNCT websites. In that case, if you
click on or view a </span><span>  CNCT ad on one of our advertising
partners' websites and are redirected or go to the </span><span>  CNCT
website, the advertising partner places a web beacon on your browser so that we
can track advertising conversions (which let us know if an ad was effective).
These web beacons will appear on your browser regardless of whether you have
refused to accept cookies or indicated that you do not want to be tracked on </span></div> <span><span>  CNCT websites or on the Internet generally. However, they
are only used by </span></span> <span><span>  CNCT for the limited purpose of
tracking advertising conversions and do not identify you personally in any way.</span></span> <div><p>  Third parties may collect information about your online activities over
time and across different websites when you use </p><span>  CNCT
websites. To avoid tracking by these third parties, you can exercise the
choices above to reject cookies, although </span><span>  CNCT has
no control over and cannot confirm whether these third parties honor the do not
track browser choices you have made.</span><p>  Security</p><p>  We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical
safeguards designed to protect the information collected by </p></div> <div><span>  CNCT
websites and </span><span>  CNCT Products. Unfortunately, the
transmission of information via the Internet is not 100% secure. Although we
will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
security; any transmission is at your own risk.</span><p>  It is important to note that if you use a computer or device that can be
accessed by others, other people may be able to access unencrypted Personal
Information. <b> If you do not want your information to be available to
others, exercise caution when using public computers or devices or when using
any computer or device to which users unauthorized by you may have access. </b></p></div> <p><p>  We recommend that you take every precaution in protecting your Personal
Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords
often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and
make sure you use a secure browser. You should also be aware that names that
you give your Wi-Fi-enabled devices, home networks and services (also known as
"friendly names") may be detectable by others outside your home, so
you should not use Personal Information as part of your friendly names.</p></p> <div><p>  Updates and
Upgrades</p><p>  CNCT</p><span>   Products may be updated or upgraded from
time to time to provide additional features, address technical issues, and
generally make your user experience better. Some </span><span>  CNCT
Products include an auto-update feature, which gives us the ability to make
updates automatically. You can change auto-update options by changing your
settings within the </span><span>  CNCT Product account
information. In very limited cases, updates may still be automatically applied,
regardless of the auto-update setting. For example, we may provide an automatic
update that prevents or fixes a security vulnerability or breach to your
network.</span></div> <div><p>  Third Party and
