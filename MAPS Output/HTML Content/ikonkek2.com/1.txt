<div><p>  KONKE
PRIVACY POLICY</p><p>  Updated Feb 07, 2017</p><p>  We at </p><span>  Konke are
committed to protecting your privacy. Our goal is to provide you with a
positive experience on our websites and when using our apps, products and
services, while at the same time keeping your Personal Information, as defined
below, secure. Our privacy practices are described below, as well as in
separate notices given when an app, product or service is purchased or
downloaded (our "Privacy Policy"). This Privacy Policy covers all </span></div> <div><span>  Konke Products and </span><span>  Konke
websites. By visiting </span><span>  Konke websites, using </span><span>  Konke Products or providing us with your Personal
Information (as defined below), you are accepting and consenting to the
practices, terms and conditions described in this Privacy Policy.</span><p>  Konke</p><span>   wants to make </span><span>  Konke
websites easy for you to navigate and </span><span>  Konke Products
easy for you to use. We are constantly improving </span><span>  Konke
websites and </span></div> <div><span>  Konke Products to make them </span><span>  more user-friendly.</span><p>  For ease of reference, we will use the following terms in this Privacy
Policy: "</p><span>  Konke", "our",
"us" or "we" means </span><span>  Konke ltd.,
including its global subsidiaries and affiliated companies (including SMARTK
and other </span><span>  konkeâs products). "</span><span>  Konke websites" include all global </span><span>  Konke
and SMARTK websites. "</span><span>  Konke Products"
includes all products and SMARTK branded apps, products and services.</span></div> <div><p>  Types of
Information Covered by This Privacy Policy</p><p>  Konke</p><span>   may collect both Personal Information and
Non-Personal Information. "Personal Information" means any
information that can be used to identify you. Some examples of Personal
Information include your name, address, email address and phone number. </span><span>  "Non-Personal Information" means information that on its
own cannot be used to identify you. Some examples of Non-Personal
Information include usage data relating to </span></div> <div><span>  Konke
websites and </span><span>  Konke Products, language preferences and
</span><span>  Konke website page views.</span><p>  Information may be aggregated and/or </p><span>  anonymized.
When information is aggregated, it is combined with information about other
customers and users. When information is </span><span>  anonymized,
Personal Information is removed from collected data and the remaining portion
of the data, containing only Non-Personal Information, is repurposed for
internal or external use, such as, for example, to determine how many users of
a particular router include an Internet-enabled television in a home network
environment, or how many users viewed a particular website video or
advertisement. Aggregated information that includes Personal Information is
considered Personal Information until it has been </span></div> <span><span>  anonymized.
</span></span> <span><span>  Anonymized information is considered Non-Personal
Information. In general, usage data collected when you visit </span></span> <div><span>  Konke websites or use </span><span>  Konke
Products is both aggregated and </span><span>  anonymized so it does
not identify you personally and is therefore Non-Personal Information.</span><p>  The </p><span>  Konke websites and </span><span>  Konke
Products are not directed to, nor does </span><span>  Konke
knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we
are informed that we have collected the Personal Information of a child under
the age of 13, we will delete that Personal Information from our systems. If
you believe we might have inadvertently collected Personal Information from or
about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at </span></div> <p><p>  privacy@Konke.com</p></p> <div><p>  How We Collect
