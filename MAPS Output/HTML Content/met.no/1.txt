Our processing basis is the <em> consent  </em>of the individual who wishes to use the service. In order to access the services, you must provide your email address and in some cases title and phone number to create a user or client ID with a password. This is necessary to give all users the most stable and fast access possible, for efficient use of the service and to control access to data that is not openly accessible to everyone. The email address will be used to contact users with information about the service, maintenance and changes. The information will be stored for the lifetime of the service, unless otherwise specified.</p></p> <p><p>  MET logs the use of the services, where the user’s IP address is included. The purpose of logging use is to facilitate troubleshooting and to prepare statistics that we use to improve and refine the services. Examples of what the statistics provide answers to are the number of queries made toward the different data or products and how long the response time is. MET does not supply information about usage statistics to other actors.</p></p> <p><p>  IP addresses can also be used for traffic management.</p></p> <p><p>  MET also operates a number of web pages for research projects we head or participate in. In some cases, it is also necessary to create a user to access data. The project manager is in charge of data processing.</p></p> <p><p>  Information collected in connection with the operation of the websites is stored on servers operated by MET. There are two exceptions. Data for the frost.met.no and drifty.met.no services is stored in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
