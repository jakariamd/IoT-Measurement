Introduction   </strong></p></div> <p><p>  BrightLine Partners LLC ("BrightLine," "we," "us," or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how, when, and why BrightLine collects, uses, and shares information from or about the visitors to brightline.tv (the “BrightLine Site”) and subscribers to ‘over-the-top’ or ‘living room’ applications (or “apps,”including mobile apps), services, or devices (“OTT Platforms”) that may interact with or use the BrightLine Services, as such term is defined below.</p></p> <p><p>  Our ad technology service, used for the delivery of our (or a third party’s) enhanced video ads and related advertising content (collectively, "Content"), Content renderer and accompanying development tools (the “SDK”), and any other products, features, tools, materials, or other services offered from time to time by BrightLine through the OTT Platforms are referred to collectively as the "BrightLine Services." </p></p> <p><p>  By visiting the BrightLine Site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the BrightLine Site’s <a href="/terms-of-use" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a>.  </p></p> <p><p>  By viewing, interacting with, or using the BrightLine Services (such as through interaction with Content), you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Please note that the privacy policy, terms of use, or other agreement of the OTT Platform using the BrightLine Services may also apply to your and/or our use of the BrightLine Services (see <strong> 9. Third Party Websites </strong>). </p></p> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy includes certain embedded hyperlinks that, depending on the device through which you are viewing it, may not be accessible. Therefore, you may need to visit the BrightLine Site on your computer to access the hyperlinks.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2. Information We Collect  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  BrightLine may collect the following information from or about you (collectively, “Information”): </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Information You Provide To Us </em>. On the BrightLine Site, you may sign up for our CTV Insight Newsletter by providing your email address, at which point you will receive marketing emails in the form of news and updates. Further, we may request via the Content delivered through the BrightLine Services that you provide your name, email address, phone number, or other Information to us and/or Business Partners (the term “Business Partners” is defined in <strong> 9. Sharing of Information with Third Parties </strong>) , such as for promotions or for other reasons that are disclosed within such Content. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Usage and Log Data </em>. We also collect Information when you interact with or view Content through the BrightLine Services or when you interact with or view the BrightLine Site (such as through our use of Google Analytics). Examples of such Information may include your IP address, device, browser, and software characteristics (e.g., type and operating system), location, activity on the BrightLine Services (e.g., metrics regarding exposure and interactions with Content) or BrightLine Site, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., AAID or IDFA), cookies identifiers, and server-generated identifiers based on a combination of device, carrier, and location attributes (see our description of "Cookies and Local Storage" below for the technology behind such data collection).  </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Third-Party Data </em><em> .  </em>We may also collect Information about you from other sources, such as data aggregators, public databases, and our Business Partners. Examples of this may include Information (whether identified, de-identified, or anonymous, and whether collected online or offline) about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your activities online (such as websites visited and advertisements viewed). We may combine the Information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 3. Cookies and Similar Technologies </strong> </p></p> <p><p>  Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect certain Information described above (e.g., Usage and Log Data). These technologies are discussed below. </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Cookies and Local Storage </em>. One technology we use is called a cookie. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the BrightLine Services, monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the BrightLine Site and BrightLine Services, and to customize Content. These uses allow us to improve the BrightLine Site and the BrightLine Services, as applicable. We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Web Beacons or Pixels </em>. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of Information from your browser or device, check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message, and determine, among other things, email open rates, the time and date on which you viewed the Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Content was viewed. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> SDKs </em>. An SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, designate the data fields to be collected, and implement any related services and functionality. An SDK integrated into an OTT Platform is, in effect, the app version of a pixel tag or beacon. We may use or work with third parties, including our Business Partners and service providers, who use our SDKs within OTT Platforms to collect Information, such as device or advertising identifiers and Information related to how such identifiers interact with the BrightLine Services. We may use this Information, for instance, to analyze how you interact with Content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through OTT Platforms.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Server Side Identifiers </em>. In some cases, BrightLine will not be able to collect a device ID or set a browser cookie.  In these cases BrightLine will create an identifier or fingerprint from a combination of user agent, carrier, and location Information that will provide a high probability of uniqueness of your OTT Platform. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 4. Our Use of Information We Collect.  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We use the Information we collect from or about you in order to help deliver a first-class user experience. Our use of this Information may include the following:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Providing, securing, enhancing, or improving the BrightLine Site and/or BrightLine Services;</li><li>contacting you, including for promotional purposes;</li><li>customizing the Content you view and evaluating how well such Content performs in cooperation with Business Partners, service providers, and other third parties;</li><li>customizing recommendations;</li><li>conducting research;</li><li>compiling aggregate data for internal and external business purposes;</li><li>preventing potentially illegal or harmful activities;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>protecting your and our rights;</li><li>other uses consistent with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use; and</li><li>any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the time we collect the Information or that is related to a request made by you. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> Use of Aggregate or De-Identified Information.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  In addition to the individual data use described in this Privacy Policy, we may aggregate Information about you and other individuals together, or otherwise "de-identify" the Information about you (which means that the Information does not identify you personally). We may use Information in these forms for any legitimate business purpose, including for research and analysis, administration of the BrightLine Services, advertising, and promotional purposes. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5. Sharing of Information with Third Parties  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We may share Information collected from or about you with third parties as explained further below, including Business Partners, service providers, and other third parties not affiliated with BrightLine. </p></p> <p><p>  <em> Business Partners.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  We work with a number of third-party distribution and media partners that have embedded our SDK, advertisers/advertising technology companies, data vendors, and other strategic partners who use or help us offer the BrightLine Services or BrightLine Site, as applicable (collectively, “Business Partners”). </p></p> <p><p>  For example, many of our Business Partners seek to measure the performance of their Content across many OTT Platforms, including through implementation of the BrightLine Services. Accordingly, BrightLine may permit the use of or provide measurement/attribution software or functionality that enables third parties (such as Nielsen) to include your viewing of Content on the BrightLine Services in the calculation of measurement statistics, such as, but not limited to, TV and Digital ratings. To learn more about your choices with respect to Nielsen measurement software, please see the information we have provided in <strong> 6. </strong> <strong> Your Choices, Including Opt-Out Options. </strong>  </p></p> <p><p>  Relatedly, we may also share certain Information collected from or about you with Business Partners in order to tailor advertisements, measure and improve advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements. This Information includes your advertising identifier, IP address, or user agent string (e.g., browser, operating system). On certain Content, we may request to pass along your email address or other certain Information that you input to Business Partners to provide offers displayed in such Content.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Service Providers.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  We may share the Information collected from or about you with companies that provide general services to us, including companies that assist with payment processing, analytics, Content distribution, data processing and management, account management, hosting, customer and technical support, marketing (e.g., email, online, or direct mail communications), and other services. These companies will have access to the Information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law. </p></p> <p><p>  We may also share your Information with any of our parent companies, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control with us.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your or Our Rights.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  In some instances, we may disclose Information from or about you without providing you with a choice. For example, we may disclose your Information in the following ways: to protect the legal rights of BrightLine, affiliates, Business Partners, service providers, or other third parties, and each of our respective equity holders, directors, officers, employees, and agents; to protect the safety and security of users of the BrightLine Site, BrightLine Services or third parties; to enforce or as consistent with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud; for risk management purposes; and to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required. If you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by BrightLine, we may provide the Information that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint. </p></p> <p><p>  <em> Third Parties in Connection with Certain Transactions.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  In the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar corporate event, such as selling all or part of our business, making a transfer of assets, or otherwise being involved in a change of control transaction, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we may transfer Information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of the transaction, including in the due diligence process. </p></p> <p><p>  <em> Third Parties with Your Consent or When You Otherwise Choose to Share.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share any Information from or about you with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such Information. Also, certain functions within the BrightLine Services may give you the option to share Information about your activities on the BrightLine Services, for example, by email, text message, social networking, or other sharing function. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6. Your Choices, Including Opt-Out Options  </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <em> Personal Information Rights. </em></p></p> <p><p>  Subject to applicable law, you have the right to request correction, amendment, or deletion of personal information that we may have on you by sending an email to us at privacy@brightline.tv with “<strong> Privacy Policy </strong>” in the subject line.
