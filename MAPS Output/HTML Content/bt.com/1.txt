We take this seriously and will always treat this information with the utmost respect and care.</p></div> <div><h4>  Consumer Privacy Policy    <a href="https://business.bt.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"> Business Privacy Policy </a></h4></div> <div><h2>  Welcome</h2><p>  We are under a legal obligation to let you know what personal information we collect about you, what we use it for and on what basis. We always need a good reason and we also have to explain to you your rights in relation to that information. You have the right to know what information we hold about you and to have a copy of it, and you can ask us to change or sometimes delete it. This has been written in line with our obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 and the Data Protection Act 2018 as they apply in the UK.  There may be local law variationsrequirements within and outside the EU which apply instead. </p></div> <p><p>  The reasons we collect information are set out in this privacy policy, but we are not telling you all this just because we have to. As a communications provider, most of what we do – from connecting calls to developing and promoting our services – involves using personal information. And we believe that it is very important for our customers to trust us with that information. We want you to be confident that we will keep it secure and use it both lawfully and ethically, respecting your privacy. </p></p> <p><p>  Our support for the right to privacy, as part of our broader commitment to human rights, is stated in our <a href="https://www.bt.com/about/digital-impact-and-sustainability/championing-human-rights/" target="_blank"> human rights policy </a>. And our privacy policy explains in detail how we use your personal information. It describes what we do (or what we may do) from the moment you ask for a service from us, when we may use your information for credit-checking purposes, through to providing and billing for that service. It also applies to marketing other products that we think will interest you. </p></p> <p><p>  But whatever we do with your information, we need a legal basis for doing it. We generally rely on one of three grounds (reasons) for our business processing. Firstly, if you have ordered or take a service from us, we are entitled to process your information so that we can provide that service to you and bill you for it. </p></p> <p><p>  Secondly, if we want to collect and use your information for other purposes, we may need to ask for your consent (permission) and, if we do, that permission must always be indicated by a positive action from you (such as ticking a box) and be informed. You are also free to withdraw your permission at any time. We tend to need permission when what is proposed is more intrusive (for example, sharing your contact details with other organisations so they can market their own products and services to you).</p></p> <p><p>  But we do not always need permission. In some cases, having assessed whether our use would be fair and not override your right to privacy, we may come to the view that it falls within the third ground – our ‘legitimate interests’ to use the information in a particular way without your permission (for example, to protect our network against cyber-attacks). But when we do this, we must tell you as you may have a right to object. And if you object specifically to us sending you marketing material, or to ‘profiling you’ for marketing purposes, we must then stop.   </p></p> <p><p>  This is all set out in detail in this policy, which focuses more on those items that we think are likely to be of most interest to you. As well as covering processing for business purposes, we give you information on circumstances in which we may have to, or can choose to, share your information.</p></p> <div><span>

                                </span><p>  Please read this policy carefully as it applies to the products and services we provide to you (such as your phone, mobile, wi-fi, TV and broadband), our apps and our websites. It applies to our consumer customers only. If you are a business customer (including sole traders and partnerships) please see our business privacy policy.  
</p></div> <p><p>  It also applies even if you’re not one of our customers and you interact with us as part of running our business, such as by: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>using one of our products or services – paid for by someone else; </li><li>taking part in a survey or trial; </li><li>entering a prize promotion; </li><li>calling our helpdesk; or</li><li>generally enquiring about our services. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you need to give us personal information about someone else in relation to our products and services, the privacy policy will also apply. And if we need the permission of the other person to use that information, we’ll ask you to check they are OK with this.</p></p> <p><p>  Technology is a fast-changing area and can be complicated.

In each message we send, you also have the option to opt out.</p></p> <p><p>  Sometimes, we use supplier tools to find likely matches of customers on our database (at an aggregated level) with those of our trusted publisher partners. Sharing the results from this process allows our partners to identify customers we may have in common so that we can show you relevant advertising when you're using their platforms, sites or applications. Those partners may also use their own tools techniques to identify additional customers of theirs who share similar characteristics to any group we are targeting to help extend the reach of our personalised advertising.</p></p> <p><p>  We’ll only use your <b> call, browser  </b>and some <b> TV records </b> (such as programmes you watch on channels we provide that are produced by other organisations) to personalise our offers as long as you are happy for us to do so. </p></p> <p><p>  We’ll only market other organisations’ products and services if you have said it is OK for us to do so.</p></p> <p><p>  You can ask us to stop sending you marketing information or withdraw your permission at any time, as set out above.</p></p> <p><p>  Read our <a href="http://home.bt.com/pages/cookies/more-about-cookies.html" target="_blank"> cookie policy </a> for more details on how we use cookies.</p></p> <div><h4>  <b> To enable Personalised Content & Recommendations and Targeted Ads </b></h4><p>  We have arrangements in place with YouView and our TV Partners (currently only ITV) to enable them to personalise the content and viewing recommendations in their Apps and deliver targeted adverts you see when viewing their channels on our TV services. </p><p>  To do this we generate an ID which relates to your Set Top Box. We generate the ID and share it with our TV Partners based on our legitimate interest to ensure you get the most out of using our TV service. This ID, together with the viewing activity collected from the Partner channel you watch on our TV service, enables our TV Partners to create a profile of your household  and identify groups of audiences. Our TV Partners can then deliver targeted ads on your TV and to personalise content and viewing recommendations in their Apps. This will include programmes that may interest you and adverts for products and services that our TV Partners think you would like to hear about. In certain scenarios (with certain TV Partners) we may also share the address linked to your Broadband Account to improve the accuracy of the relevant ads. See the TV Partners privacy policy for more information.</p></div> <p><p>  You can tell our TV Partners to stop providing you with targeted ads at any time by visiting the Privacy Settings in your Set Top Box (if you ask for targeted ads to be turned off, you will still see adverts but they won’t be tailored to you).

</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If we use this information for market research, training, testing, development purposes, defend or bring claims, or to create a profile about you, we do so because it is in our legitimate business interests of running an efficient and effective business which can adapt to meet our customers’ needs. </p></p> <p><p>  We create a profile about you based on what you have ordered from us and how you use our products and services.  This helps us tailor the offers we share with you.  You can ask us to stop profiling you for marketing purposes at any time, as set out above.</p></p> <div><h4>  <b> To run credit and fraud prevention checks </b></h4><p>  Before we provide you with a product or service (including upgrades or renewals), or sometimes when you use our products and services, we’ll use personal information you have given us together with information we have collected from <b> credit reference agencies </b> (such as Experian or Equifax), the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) security alert, or <b> fraud prevention agencies </b> (such as Cifas).  We use this information to manage our credit risk, and prevent and detect fraud and money laundering.  We’ll also use these organisations to confirm your identity. When they get a search from us, a 'footprint' goes on your file which other organisations might see. We might also share the information with other organisations. We do this because it’s in our, and the organisations’, legitimate interests to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to check identities, to protect our business and to keep to laws that apply to us.</p></div> <p><p>  Details of the personal information that will be used include your name, address, date of birth, contact details, financial information, employment details and device identifiers, including <b> IP address </b> and vehicle details.</p></p> <p><p>  If you don’t become one of our customers, we’ll still keep the result of our credits checks about you if we have a legal obligation and it’s in our legitimate interests to help prevent or detect fraud.  Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your information can be held by us and the organisations we share it with for up to six years.</p></p> <p><p>  If you give us false or inaccurate information which we identify as fraudulent, we’ll pass that on to fraud prevention agencies. We might also share it with law enforcement agencies, as may the agencies we have shared the information with.</p></p> <p><p>  If you tell us you’re associated with someone else financially (for example, by marriage or civil partnership), we’ll link your records together.  So you must make sure you have their agreement to share information about them. The agencies we share the information with also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully asks the agency to break that link.</p></p> <p><p>  If we, a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, decide that you are a credit, fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have asked for, or we may stop providing existing services to you.</p></p> <p><p>  As part of running credit and fraud prevention checks using your personal information, decisions may be made by automated means.  This means we may automatically decide that you pose a fraud or money laundering risk if our processing reveals your behaviour to be consistent with money laundering or known fraudulent conduct, or is inconsistent with your previous submissions, or you appear to have deliberately hidden your true identity. You have rights in relation to automated decision making, if you have any questions about this please contact us using the details below.</p></p> <p><p>  The credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or money laundering risk and this may result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us using the details below.</p></p> <p><p>  We send credit reference and fraud prevention agencies information about applications, and they keep that information. We might also give them details of your accounts and bills, including how you manage them. This includes telling them about your account balances, what you pay us and if you miss a payment (going back in the past, too).  So if you don't pay your bills on time, credit reference agencies will record that. They, or a fraud prevention agency, might tell others doing similar checks – including organisations trying to trace you or recover money you owe them.</p></p> <p><p>  There are different credit reference agencies in the UK (for example, Callcredit, Equifax and Experian). Each one might hold different information about you. If you want to find out what information they have on you, they may charge you a small fee.</p></p> <p><p>  Whenever credit reference and fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area, they place contractual responsibilities on the organisation receiving it to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also make the organisation receiving the information subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ aimed at sharing information securely.</p></p> <p><p>  Here are links to the information notice for each of the three main Credit Reference Agencies.

To collect debt </b>
</h4><p>  If you don’t pay your bills, we might ask a debt-recovery agency to collect what you owe. We’ll give them information about you (such as your contact details) and your account (the amount of the debt) and may choose to sell the debt to another organisation to allow us to receive the amount due.</p></div> <div><h4>  <b> To prevent and detect crime and fraud </b></h4><p>  We’ll use your personal information to help prevent and detect crime and fraud. We’ll also use it to prevent and detect criminal attacks on our network or against your equipment.  We monitor traffic over our network, trace nuisance or malicious calls, and track malware and cyber-attacks.</p><p>  To do that we use the following information, but only where strictly necessary.</p><ul>  <li>Your contact details and other information to confirm your identity and communications with us. This includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth, email address, passwords and credentials (for example, security questions).  We do not store the original copy of your password. Instead we keep it in a form that allows us to authenticate you but does not allow us to work out what your original password is.</li><li>Your payment and financial information.</li><li>Information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Details of the products and services you’ve bought and how you use them – including your:</li><li><b> Call records </b> the date, time, length and cost of your communications, device information, the location of your device from <b> Cell Site  </b>data (the antennae and communications equipment that we use to create the cellular network) , where  the call was made to and from, the network used and the type of communication, including when you make calls abroad.</li><li><b> Browser records </b>-the types and nature of websites that you visit, as well as the date, time, length of your internet session, <b> cell site </b> and network used, device information, your data usage and your <b> IP address.  </b>.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><b> TV records- </b> details of the devices you use (including the <b> device information –  </b>identifierssuch as <b> MAC address  </b>or <b> IMSI </b>), the channels, programmes and adverts you watch on them, the services you access, how long you watch and what actions you take when doing so, including how you view, record and fast-forward programmes
</li><li>Content of SMS you send and receive using our network.</li><li>CCTV footage in our shops and buildings.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use this personal information because we have a legitimate interest in protecting our network and business from attacks and to prevent and detect crime and fraud. We also share it with other organisations (such as other communications providers and banks) who have the same legitimate interests.  Doing this helps make sure our network works properly and helps protect you from attacks.</p></p> <p><p>  If you call the emergency services, we’ll give them information about you and where you are so they can help. We do this because it is necessary to protect you, or another person, and because it is in our interests to help the emergency services in providing help to you.</p></p> <p><p>  We may share your personal information with other companies who you have a relationship with – like your bank – or with those companies' that process information on their behalf – so that they can ensure that their customer records are up to date, and also in some cases prevent fraud – for example by checking whether a transaction, such as an online payment or a cash withdrawal, is definitely being requested by you, and not a fraudster.</p></p> <div><span>  
                            	                                             
                                To meet our legal and regulatory obligations
                                </span><p>  We might have to release personal information about you to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</p></div> <div><h4>  <b> To law enforcement agencies </b></h4><p>  Under investigatory powers legislation, we might have to share personal information about you to government and law-enforcement agencies, such as the police, to help detect and stop crime, prosecute offenders and protect national security. They might ask for the following details.</p><ul>  <li>Your contact details. This includes your name, gender, address, phone number, date of birth, email address, passwords and credentials (such as your security questions and answers) needed to confirm your identity and your communications with us.</li><li>Your communications with us, such as calls, emails and webchats.</li><li>Your payment and financial information.</li><li>Details of the products and services you’ve bought and how you use them – including your <b> call </b>, <b> browser  </b>(including IP address) and <b> TV records. </b></li></ul></div> <p><p>  The balance between privacy and investigatory powers is challenging. We share your personal information when the law says we have to, but we have strong oversight of what we do and get expert advice to make sure we’re doing the right thing to protect your right to privacy. You can read more about our approach to investigatory powers in our report on <a href="https://www.bt.com/about/digital-impact-and-sustainability/championing-human-rights/privacy-and-free-expression/report" target="_blank"> Privacy and free expression in UK communications </a>.

That might be when a law says we have to share that information or because of a court order.</p></p> <p><p>  In limited circumstances, we may also share your information with other public authorities, even if we do not have to. However, we would need to be satisfied that a disclosure of information is lawful and proportionate (in other words, appropriate to the request). And we would need appropriate assurances about security and how the information is used and how long it is kept. </p></p> <div><h4>  <b> For regulatory reasons </b></h4><p>  We’ll also use your <b> call </b>, <b> browser  </b>(including <b> IP address </b>) and <b> TV records </b> to find the best way of routing your communications through the various parts of our network, equipment and systems as required by our regulator.</p><p>  If you order a phone service, we’ll ask if you want your details included in our directory services such as our Phone Book. If you do, we’ll publish your details and share that information with other providers of directory services. Ex-directory numbers aren’t included and will not appear in The Phone Book.</p></div> <div><h3>  Sharing your information</h3><p>  In this section we detail how, why and with whom we share your information.
