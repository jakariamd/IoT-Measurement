            Your Privacy Choices on Snapchat
          </h1><p>  In some states you have the right to know whether we sell your data and in California you have the right to know if we share it for cross-context behavioral advertising purposes ‚Äî and to opt-out if we do. Good news! We don‚Äôt sell or "share" your data as defined by those state laws.</p><p>  In some states you also have the right to opt-out of targeted advertising. We provide all of our users the ability to do so by adjusting your in-app advertising preferences to turn off activity-based ads as described <a href="/hc/articles/7012345515796" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  If you live in California, you also have the right to request that we limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information. This is called a "Request to Limit." We collect and use limited forms of sensitive personal information, like precise geolocation (if you‚Äôve given us permission), to provide you services you‚Äôve requested, but also to show you more relevant, fun, and interesting ads.</p></p> <p><p>  If you‚Äôd like us to limit the use of your sensitive personal information to provide only the basic, necessary services, you can do so by following the instructions below.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Please Note </strong>: If you submit a Request to Limit, you‚Äôll still see ads in your app, but those ads may be less relevant to you. For example, on Snapchat you may still see ads based on information you provide us and inferences we make based on your activity on Snapchat.</p></p> <p><p>  You can learn more about rights that may be applicable to you in our U.S. state privacy law disclosure <a href="https://snap.com/privacy/us-state-privacy-notice" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <div><h3>  California Privacy Choices</h3><p>  Snapchatters can submit a Request to Limit:</p><p>  <strong> On iOS </strong>:</p><ul>  <li>Tap the¬†‚öôÔ∏è button in the Profile screen to open Settings</li><li>Scroll down to 'Privacy Controls' and tap '<strong> California Privacy Choices </strong>'</li><li>Toggle on '<strong> Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information </strong>' to submit</li></ul><p>  <strong> On Android </strong>:</p><ul>  <li>Tap the¬†‚öôÔ∏è button in the Profile screen to open Settings</li><li>Scroll down to '<strong> Privacy Control </strong>' and tap '<strong> California Privacy Choices </strong>'</li><li>Toggle on '<strong> Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information </strong>' to submit</li></ul></div> <p><p>  If you change your mind later, you can toggle 'Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information' back off to opt in again.
