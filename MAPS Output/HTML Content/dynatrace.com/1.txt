The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. Specific measures we use include restricting access to staff on a need to know basis, encryption during transit and at rest, and use of anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems to protect against attacks or other unauthorized acts in respect of information systems.</p></div> <div><h3>  Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only)</h3><p>  If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p><p>  However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent to do so.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p></div> <p><p>  If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p></p> <p><p>  Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p></p> <p><p>  If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the "<a href="#how-to-contact-us-regarding-your-privacy" target="_blank"> How to contact us </a>" heading below.</p></p> <div><h3>  International data transfers</h3><p>  Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection and privacy laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p><p>  Specifically, the Dynatrace group of companies (Dynatrace LLC and its subsidiaries) operates around the world, as listed here: <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/company/locations/" target="_blank"> www.dynatrace.com/company/locations/ </a>.

This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p></div> <p><p>  However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group of companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection and privacy law.</p></p> <p><p>  Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p></p> <div><h3>  Data retention</h3><p>  We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p><p>  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p></div> <div><h3>  Your data protection rights</h3><p>  You may exercise the rights available to you under applicable data protection laws. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as described under "<a href="#how-to-contact-us-regarding-your-privacy" target="_blank"> How to contact us </a>" below. If you are a resident of the European Union, you may:</p><ul>  <li><strong> access, correct, update or request deletion </strong> of your personal information.</li><li><strong> object to processing </strong> of your personal information, ask us to <strong> restrict processing </strong> of your personal information or <strong> request portability </strong> of your personal information.</li><li>In the limited circumstances where we have collected and process your personal information for a specific purpose with your consent, then you can <strong> withdraw your consent </strong> for that specific processing at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted based on your consent prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your personal information for the purpose originally agreed to, unless we have another legal basis for processing.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>You have the <strong> right to complain to a data protection authority </strong> about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA, Switzerland and certain non-European countries are available <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080" target="_blank"> here </a>.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.

We may need to request specific information from you to verify your identity and check your right to access the personal information or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that your personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p></p> <div><h3>  How to contact us regarding your privacy</h3><p>  If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice or seek resolution to any privacy or data collection issue with Dynatrace, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@dynatrace.com" target="_blank"> privacy@dynatrace.com </a>.</p><p>  You may also contact our Data Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy.dpo@dynatrace.com" target="_blank"> privacy.dpo@dynatrace.com </a>.</p><p>  If you are from certain regions like Europe, you also have the right to lodge any complaints or concerns with your DPA.
