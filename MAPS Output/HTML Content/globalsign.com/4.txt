</li></ul><p>  N.Rich intent data, sales intelligence and advertising services for Business-to-Business (B2B) companies.
                We process both personal- and behavioural data
                in order to enable serving advertising and content that is more relevant for your work and professional
                interests. We use cookies and similar technologies and you can <a href="./opt-out" target="_blank"> opt-out </a>
                at any time.
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><strong> What we do </strong>
</li></ul><p>  We are N.Rich Technologies Oy, a Finnish company developing and operatingproviding two software-as-a-service
                platforms called N.Rich and IntentHub. N.Rich is an Account-Based Go-To-Market software platform offering
                advertising, sales intelligence, and automation capabilities to B2B companies. IntentHub is an intent data
                software platform for sales, marketing and customer-success functions of B2B companies. What this means is
                that our customers use our services to be able to offer more relevant products, services and messages to
                their existing and potential customers through utilizing company data, behavioural signals and targeted
                advertising capabilities we offer. We collect company-level behavioral data from millions of websites globally,
                through programmatic advertising systems, our clients’ or partners’ websites, and from our partners and augment
                this data using algorithms and machine-learning. We also deliver targeted advertising to companies and
                professionals through the said advertising systems.</p></div> <p><p>  In order to offer our service, we process three types of data; (i) “pseudonymised” data that alone can’t
                be associated with the end-user, such as IP-address or unique user identifiers, (ii) direct personal
                data that can be associated with the end-user such as name, email address or phone number, and (iii)
                online and offline activity data that may be associated with the two categories of personal data
                described above and may be used for creating personal behavioural profile of the end-user for marketing,
                sales and analytics purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  We process end-user personal and behavioural data in the business or professional role related to an
                organisation such as a company. We do not have any interest in processing or understanding the end-user
                data or behaviour in “consumer mode” related to a non-business or professional role. Since it is often
                impossible to separate professional and “consumer mode data”, we are typically forced to process
                “consumer mode” data as well. Whenever possible, we take active steps to avoid processing “consumer
                mode” data.</p></p> <p><p>  We gather personal and activity data using three primary methods; (i) through a small piece of code
                called N.Rich Tag deployed on third party and our client websites, (ii) through integrations to our
                clients’ other software systems, and (iii) through our clients importing such data into the N.Rich
                software.</p></p> <p><p>  We use cookies and similar technologies to store unique end-user identifiers into your web browser.
                Cookies are used to ensure that we or our clients reach the right end-users with advertising and the
                advertising content the end-users see will be relevant. We also use cookies for maintaining a consistent
                profile of the end-users and their activities enabling serving personalised advertising or content, and
                for providing analytics related to the activities and potential interest of the end-users towards our-,
                or our clients’ business offering.</p></p> <p><p>  More information about the cookies used by N.Rich is available <a href="https://n-rich.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NK/pages/1287323667/N.Rich+Website+Tag+fundamentals" target="_blank"> here </a>.
