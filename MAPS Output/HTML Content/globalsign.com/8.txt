This privacy notice (“<b> Privacy Notice </b></span><span>  “) explains who we are, how we collect, use and share personal information about you, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.</span></div> <div><p>  The Privacy Notice covers personal information we collect:</p><ul>  <li>a) When you provide information to the Bombora hosted platform and related </li></ul><span>  analytics products</span><ul>  <li>b) When you visit one of our corporate websites (such as https://bombora.com, https://www.signal-hq.com/, https://www.netfactor.com/) (“<b> Website </b>“) and/or provide information to Bombora over the usual course of our business practices, such as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities (see <a href="https://bombora.com/privacy-policy/#privacy-websites" target="_blank"> ‘privacy for our websites’ </a>).</li></ul></div> <div><p>  <b> Quick links </b></p><p>  We recommend that you read this Privacy Notice completely to ensure you are fully informed. However, to make it easier for you to review those parts of this Privacy Notice which may apply to you, we have divided up the Privacy Notice into the following sections:</p></div> <div><h4>  <b> 1. Who we are </b></h4><p>  One of the primary ways Bombora collects data is from a proprietary data cooperative (“Data Co-op”). The Data Co-op consists of business to business (“B2B”) websites of publishers, marketers, agencies, technology providers, and research and event firms that contribute content consumption data to a massive pooled data set that details the buying intent of a company. </p><p>  Co-op members provide consent-based brand-anonymous data, including </p><span>  Unique IDs</span></div> <span><span>   (including Cookie IDs), IP address, page URL and referrer URL, browser type, operating system, browser language, and engagement data (including dwell time, scroll velocity, scroll depth and time between scrolls) (collectively, “Event Data”). Engagement data validates You are actually consuming content and not quickly bouncing from the website. The full data set is refreshed weekly. </span></span> <p><p>  Bombora collects the Event Data, analyses the content You consumed on the website, and assigns the content topics using the Bombora topic taxonomy (“Topics”).  </p></p> <p><p>  When Bombora is able to identify from Your Event Data which company You represent (“Company Name/URL”), Bombora aggregates the Topics and Company Name/URL to a company profile, including all events of other employees from the same Company Name/URL. </p></p> <p><p>  The tag collects your actions but the actions are assigned to a company.</p></p> <div><p>  Bombora provides the following hosted platform and related analytics products (collectively the “Services”) to its clients (“Subscribers”):</p></div> <div><h4>  <b> Services </b></h4><p>  <b> 1.1 Company Surge® Analytics </b></p><p>  An analytics report listing company name, topic and </p><span>  Company Surge®</span><span>   score. To create the score Bombora collects, stores, organizes, uses and erases data which is anonymized and aggregated such that no personal data exists. Bombora will not disclose any data to a company other than company name, topics searched, and Company Surge® score. These reports are created by collecting data from tags on publisher websites. The Bombora Tag (defined below) collects IP address (which is anonymous and converted to company URL), engagement metrics, and topics (which are determined by real time algorithm). The topics (based on Bombora’s B2B taxonomy) are attributed to company name. Our proprietary algorithm compares topic interest over 30 Billion interactions to create a score. That score is the company’s interest level in the topics, compared over time.</span></div> <p><p>  <b> 1.2 Audience Solutions </b></p></p> <div><p>  Audience Solutions</p><span>   is a data product that supports the process of digital ad buying or ad targeting by our customers.  Audience Solutions and Measurement Products append data to, and share, a Cookie ID.  Bombora appends firmographic and demographic data to the Cookie ID, only at the domain (name of website) and at the company level.</span><p>  The firmographic and demographic data may include industry, functional area, professional group, company revenue, company size, seniority, decision maker and predictive signals. Bombora does not share any data which could be used to identify You, an individual data subject.</p></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Facebook integration </b></li></ul><span>  : As fully described in ‘</span><span>  ‘what we do and collect and why’</span><span>  , through the Bombora integration with Facebook, Bombora uploads audiences derived from hashed emails associated with domains into Facebook. Facebook matches these hashed emails against their database of users to create a custom audience for targeting.</span><ul>  <li><b> LinkedIn integration </b></li></ul><span>  : Through the LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform API, Bombora sends Company Surge® Intent data as a list of domains (e.g., companyx.com) into LinkedIn. LinkedIn matches its users to domains to create a matched audience for targeting within the LinkedIn Ad Platform.</span></div> <p><p>  <b> 1.3 Measurement Products </b></p></p> <div><p>  The following </p><span>  Measurement</span><span>   suite of products collect demographic and firmographic information. The Bombora Tag is (Bombora term) a JavaScript or pixel tag placed on the websites of Subscribers which collects data from each device which visits the Subscriber’s websites including (1) placement and synchronization of unique identifiers, such as cookie ID or hashed email; (2) IP address and information derived therefrom, such as city and state, company name, or domain name; (3) engagement level data, such as dwell time, scroll depth, scroll velocity, and time between scrolls; (4) page URL and information derived therefrom such as content, context and topics; (5) referrer URL; (6) browser type and (7) operating system (collectively the “Bombora Tag”). Each of the products in the measurement suite uses information collected from the Bombora Tag in different ways to provide subscribers with an end product.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Audience Verification: </b></li></ul><span>   With our </span><span>  Audience Verification</span><span>   product, a Subscriber places a tag on their campaign creative. The audience verification tag is able to collect the following data insights when You click the advertisement: Unique IDs (including Cookie IDs), IP address and information derived such as geography, User agent, browser type and operating system (OS).</span><ul>  <li><b> Visitor Insights: </b></li></ul><span>   With our </span></div> <div><span>  Visitor Insights</span><span>   product, a Subscriber places a tag on their website. (We also have placed the Bombora  Tag on our Websites). The visitor insights tag collects insights about website visitors, including but not limited to the following data: (i) overall visitor engagement segmented by high, medium, and low percentages; (ii) overall visitor engagement compared to previous date ranges; (iii) total companies, unique users, sessions and page views; (iv) total companies, unique users, sessions and page views compared to previous date ranges; (v) engagement by company domain segmented by high, medium, and low and (vi) unique users, sessions, and page views by company domain. This data can be delivered through the Bombora user interface, from a daily feed, or directly from the Google Analytics platform.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Visitor Track </b></li></ul><span>  Visitor Track</span><span>   is used along with certain software tools, such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information. We do this in order to analyze traffic to our Website, and to better understand the needs of our customers and visitors. Some examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (“IP”) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) referring page to our Website along with each page viewed, including date and time.</span></div> <p><p>  Through the Services, Bombora provides data to our Subscriber to help them better connect and target organizations they want to reach (we refer to the individuals in those organizations as “End Users”). Bombora and its partners engage in tracking End Users’ interactions with business-to-business content across various digital properties like web registration forms, widgets, websites and webpages (whether accesses via computer, mobile or tablet device or other technologies) (“Digital Properties”). We then take this data and aggregate the information collected into demographic segments, such as company revenue and size, functional area, industry, professional group, and seniority. This helps Subscribers customize engagement based on topics that organizations are interested in and the intensity of their consumption</p></p> <div><h4>  <b> 2. Privacy for our services </b></h4><p>  This section describes how we collect and use information we receive or collect from End Users through our Services (we refer to this collectively as “<b> Service Information </b></p><span>  “). This includes details about the type of information we collect automatically, the types of information we receive from other sources and the purposes of those collections.</span><p>  <b> 2.1 What information do we collect and why? </b></p><p>  <b> Information we collect automatically: </b></p></div> <div><p>  We use and deploy various cookies and similar tracking technologies (see </p><span>  ‘cookies and similar technologies’</span><span>   ) to automatically collect certain information about your device when you interact with Digital Properties that use our technology. Some of this information, including your IP address and certain unique identifiers, may identify a particular computer or device and may be considered “personal data” in certain jurisdictions including in the European Economic Area (“<b> EEA </b></span></div> <span><span>  “) and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). However, for its Services </span></span> <p><p>  For the services that we provide, Bombora does not collect any information that we reverse engineer to enable us to identify you personally such as your name, mailing address or email address</p></p> <span><span>  . The information we collect is not used to identify you as an individual.</span></span> <div><p>  We collect this information by assigning a random unique identifier (“<b> UID </b></p><span>  “) to your device the first time you interact with a Digital Property that uses our technology. This UID is then used to associate you with information we collect about you.</span><p>  The information we automatically collect may include:</p><ul>  <li><b> Information about your device </b></li></ul><span>   such as the type, model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android), carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address and unique identifiers assigned to your device such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA) or Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID).</span></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> Information about your online behavior  </b></li></ul><span>  such as information about the activities or actions you take on Digital Properties we work with. This may include time spent on a web page, whether you scroll or click on an ad or a web page, session start/stop time, time zone, your referring website address, and geo-location (including city, metro area, country, zip code and potentially geographic co-ordinates if you have enabled location services on your device) pages and times visited.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><b> Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on  </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>  such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it and the number of times you have seen the ad.</span></span> <div><p>  <b> Information we receive from other sources </b></p><span>  We may also combine, merge, and/or enhance the information we collect about you (collectively “Service Information’). This can include the information we collect about you with information collected from third parties such as other web-based and mobile networks, exchanges and websites (“<b> Partners </b></span><span>  “) or our Subscribers (for example, they may upload certain “offline” data into the Services). Here is a list of </span></div> <div><span>  our current partners</span><span>  . In addition, the Service Information we automatically collect may be combined and associated with business profile information that we infer about you, such as: age, domain, functional area, household income, income status and changes, language, seniority, education, manufacturing, professional group, industry, company revenue, and net-worth.</span><p>  This information may include hashed identifiers derived from other information such as email addresses, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data (like your industry, employer, company size, job title or department) and content viewed, or actions taken on a Digital Property.</p></div> <div><p>  We use the Services Information as follows:</p><ul>  <li><b> To provide the services to our Subscribers </b></li></ul><span>  . Generally, we use the Service Information to help Subscribers better understand their current and prospective customers and market trends. This enables Subscribers to better target and customize websites, content, other general marketing efforts and to measure and optimize the performance of their marketing.</span><ul>  <li><b> To build various inferenced data segments  </b></li></ul></div> <div><span>  (“<b> Data Segments </b></span><span>  ”)</span><span>   We may use the Service Information to build Data Segments related to, for instance, the industry you are in or the type of content you or the organization you work for appear to be interested in. We use these Data Segments to help our Subscribers understand their own customers, evaluate customer and market trends and create reports and scoring regarding their customer’s behavior. The Data Segments also may be associated with UIDs, cookies and/or mobile device advertising IDs.</span></div> <ul><ul>  <li><b> To do “interest-based advertising”. </b></li></ul></ul> <span><span>   We sometimes use or work with Subscribers and Partners that use UIDs or other information derived from information such as email hashes. This information in turn may be associated with cookies and may be used to target ads to you that are based on “offline” interest-based segments – such as your interests, transactions or demographic information – or used by Subscribers that target and analyze such ads. This is often known as “interest-based advertising.” You can find out more about this type of advertising at the </span></span> <div><span>  DAA’s website</span><ul>  <li><b> To do cross-device tracking. </b></li></ul><span>   We (or our Partners and Subscribers we work with) may use the Service Information (e.g. the IP addresses and UIDs) to try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets or other devices), or work with providers that do this in order to better target ad campaigns to common sets of End Users. For example, a brand may wish to target customers that it usually recognizes on web browsers through mobile apps.</span></div> <div><ul>  <li><b> To do “user matching”: </b></li></ul><span>   We (or our Partners) may use the Services Information, in particular various UIDs, to sync cookies and other identifiers with other Partners and Subscribers (i.e. to do “</span><span>  user matching</span><span>  “). For example, in addition to the UID’s an End User has been assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of UIDs our Partners or Subscribers have assigned to an End User. When we identify matches, we then let our Subscribers and Partners know in order to help them do any of the above, including enhancing their own data and Data Segments to do interest-based advertising or provide insights to other customers. For instance, we use </span></div> <div><span>  Facebook Custom Audiences</span><span>   to match users.</span><ul>  <li><b> As we believe to be necessary or appropriate </b></li></ul><span>    under applicable law including laws outside your country of residence:</span><ul>  <li>to comply with legal processes</li><li>to respond to requests from public and government authorities including authorities outside your country of residence</li><li>to enforce our terms and conditions</li><li>to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates</li><li>to protect yours, our affiliates and/or our rights, privacy, safety or property</li><li>to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li><li><b> To evaluate, operate or improve the Services. </b></li></ul></div> <p><p>  <b> 2.2 Cookies and similar technologies </b></p></p> <p><p>  Our Partners and our Subscribers use various UIDs, cookies and similar tracking technologies to automatically collect information from End Users across various Digital Properties (</p></p> <div><span>  as previously described above</span><span>  ).
