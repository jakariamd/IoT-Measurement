Under certain circumstances, in accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations, we may withhold access to your data, or decline to modify, erase, port, or restrict the processing of your data.</p></p> <p><p>  Please be advised that if you exercise the rights to erase data, restrict or object to our processing, or to withdraw your consent, we may not be able to continue providing our services to you if the necessary data is missing for processing.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> Transfer, storage, and processing of data abroad </em></p></p> <p><p>  As noted in the “Sharing your personal data” section of this Policy, as a globally operating company, we may share your information with our affiliate companies or third parties. Please refer to the “Sharing your personal data” section of this Policy for the recipients of your data and the reasons for our provision of your data to them. Where such entities are located in other countries and jurisdictions, we will therefore be transferring your personal data outside of the European Economic Area. In making such data transfers, we make sure to protect your personal data by applying the level of security required by applicable privacy laws. Where we transfer your data to a country or jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the transferee to require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal data. SCCs are one of a number of "appropriate safeguards" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection. You may request a copy of such SCCs from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the contact window set forth in the “Whom should I contact?” section of this Policy.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> Further processing </em></p><p>  If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose not covered by this Policy, then we will provide you with a new policy explaining this new use prior to commencing such further processing for a new purpose. This new policy sets out the relevant new purpose and processing conditions. In such a case, we will find a lawful basis for further processing, and whenever necessary, we will seek your prior written consent to such further processing.</p><p>  <em> Security </em></p></div> <p><p>  We protect your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access. Some of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls. We take our data security very seriously. Therefore the security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection against abuse.</p></p> <p><p>  The servers through which we collect your information are usually encoded using the encryption module of your browser, and are certified by renowned institutions for international encryption technique. If necessary, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your personal information. Moreover, we have put in place additional and comprehensive state-of-the-art security measures every time your data are accessed through the internet. Firewalls prevent unauthorized access. Diverse encryption and identification layers protect your data from intrusion or disclosure to third parties during data transfer. Furthermore, we internally use sophisticated encoding methods in order to prevent decoding by unauthorized persons. Moreover, an electronic identifier is generated during data transfer to safeguard your information.</p></p> <p><p>  For your confidentiality and security, we use IDs and passwords to secure your personal information. It is important for you to protect your ID, password, or any personal information. Do not disclose your personal information, especially your password, to anyone. When you are finished using our services, please do not forget to log out from your account. If you share a computer, whether in a public or private setting, be sure to sign off and close your browsers when finished using a shared computer.</p></p> <p><p>  If you believe that the security of your data has been compromised, or if you would like more information on the measures we use to protect your data, you can contact us using the channels set forth in the “Whom should I contact?” section of this Policy.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> What are your choices?  </em></p><p>  You have the choice to allow us to collect and process your data. The collection and processing of your personal data is neither a statutory nor a contractual requirement, although as noted above, we will be unable to provide you with certain services without the necessary data.</p><p>  If you are dealing with us online, note that most browsers will inform you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to receive notifications whenever you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies. Additionally, you can disable or delete the data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, on your browser or on the website of its manufacturer.</p></div> <p><p>  You can always choose not to provide us with your data. In case we may need such data to process your requests, we will inform you of our constraints.</p></p> <p><p>  To the extent that you have consented to our processing of your data, you can choose to discontinue our processing at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose to request a copy of the personal data we store and process regarding you.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose to add or update data that you have provided us with.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose to erase your data, or choose to restrict our processing of your data instead.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose to port your data to a third party under the conditions stated above.</p></p> <p><p>  You can choose to object to our processing of your data.</p></p> <p><p>  You can inform us of your choices or request on any data processing aspect listed above using the channels set forth in the “Whom should I contact?” section of this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  In summary, what we are allowed to do with your data—with limited exceptions under applicable privacy laws—is up to you. However, in the event that you choose not to let us further process your data, your choice may affect the delivery of our obligations or services to you. In this case, we will inform you of our constraints.</p></p> <div><p>  <em> Whom should I contact? </em></p><p>  If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to exercise any of your rights, or if you have any complaints that you would like to discuss with us, please send us a signed and dated request.
