Our services both measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by measuring – in aggregate – which messages are most effective at influencing users to visit their place and provide actionable insights on consumer behaviors, competitive share, media effectiveness and market trends. This agreement outlines how we collect information, what information we collect and how we use this information on our site, Arrivalist.com, and for Arrivalist’s marketing services.</p></div> <p><p>  On Arrivalist.com we collect information that helps us analyze the effectiveness of our website and its performance. We may collect and use non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) information such as in aggregate to gauge the effectiveness of our own marketing programs or deliver advertising messages to our site visitors for marketing purposes. We also collect Personally-Identifiable information (“Non-PII”) from information entered in to our “Contact Us” form.

The information that we collect includes Non-PII information related to the user’s device’s destination (on a city level), which marketing messages the user has been exposed to and subsequent changes in the user’s destination on a market – by – market basis. None of the information we collect is personally-identifiable and the destination information that we collect is only the on the city level. (i.e., device 12345 was exposed to Ad 1 and 2 in City A and moved to City B). We may receive additional information about you from third party data or marketing partners, and combine it with other information we have about you. We may license data from third party data providers which we append with a variety of data sources to feed into our analytics services. We may deliver marketing messages, such as banner ads or content, to users who have been exposed to our marketing partner’s media in order to serve subsequent marketing messages based on changes in the city that the user’s device is in. For these marketing messages, the information that we collect includes Non-PII information such as IP addresses, destination derived from cell towers, information from the destinations of Wifi routers and other means of determining (on a city-wide level) the destination of a computing device. Should a user wish not to have the messages his/her device is exposed to and the subsequent changes in the device’s destination measured broadly in aggregate, he / she may opt out by following the instructions in the opt out section below.</p></p> <p><p>  Arrivalist uses the information that we collect or license to report—in aggregate – on the effectiveness of marketing campaigns on influencing users to experience new places. We report to advertisers which online marketing messages (email, banner ads, site visits, video views, etc) precede changes in a device’s destination.</p></p> <p><p>  Arrivalist does not sell the data that we collect to third parties. Arrivalist does provide a reporting interface where our clients, the marketers, may gather actionable insights about consumer behavior, competitive share, market trends, and the effectiveness of their campaigns. In addition, Arrivalist may promote travel-related messages from our affiliates, and deliver ads in the aggregate (not to individuals) to devices which our technology has indicated have changed destinations recently.</p></p> <p><p>  We will not share our data with third parties unless we are required to by legal authorities or compelled to in a court of law.</p></p> <p><p>  Arrivalist stores its data in distributed data storage system.
