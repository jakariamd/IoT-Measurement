</span></div> <p><p>  Wargaming is committed to providing all players with a positive gaming experience and a key part of that is how we handle our rules and what happens when they are violated. Our goal is to make our games a clean and safe environment where players of all ages can have fun. Below you'll find the outline of our new policy—rule policies aren't the most exciting reading material, but we think you'll find this valuable.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> The new policy goes into effect Wednesday, March 23 at 07:00 PT | 09:00 CT | 10:00 ET </strong>. We're revealing it now so everyone is aware of these changes in advance. As we roll out the updates to our pollicy, we'll wipe the slate clean for every Wargaming customer with an active account. Any prior in-game sanctions, chat violations, or forum warnings will no longer count against you.</p></p> <div><span>  <strong> Please Note:  </strong></span></div> <div><h3>  <strong> Under Our New Policy </strong></h3><ul>  <li>All players not currently permabanned start fresh under the new system; old strikes are forgiven.</li><li>Strikes are replaced by an internal system called "relapses." Each time a player relapses and commits another violation, additional ban time is added.</li><li>Relapse points </li></ul><span>  <strong> do not </strong></span><span>   expire and will continue to count up resulting in longer bans.</span><ul>  <li>See the following table for an explanation of the different types of violations and their ban times:</li></ul></div> <div><span>  TYPE:</span><span>  VIOLATIONS INCLUDE:</span><span>  NOTES:</span><td>  Minor chat violations(1 day chat ban)</td><td>  Profanity, insults, minor harassment
</td><ul>  <li>Each new violation adds +1 day to ban time</li><li>Never result in a permanent ban
</li></ul><td>  Major chat violations</td><span>  (15 day chat ban)</span><td>  Extreme hate speech/harassment; threats of violence
</td><ul>  <li>More than two (2) result in a permanent ban
</li></ul><td>  Minor game violations</td><span>  (1 day game ban)</span></div> <td><td>  Annoying violations that are not direct physical attacks on another player or vehicle. Include pinging the map repeatedly, drowning themselves, stating in chat and then deliberately AFKing</td></td> <div><ul>  <li>Each new violation adds +1 day to ban time</li><li>Never result in a permanent ban
</li></ul><td>  Major game violations(3 day game ban)</td><td>  Physics abuse or unsportsmanlike conduct that directly attacks another player/vehicle on your team
</td><ul>  <li>Each new violation adds +3 days to ban time</li><li>More than seven (7) in a quarter results in a permanent ban
</li></ul></div> <div><h3>  How do I report someone?</h3><p>  <strong> To report a chat violation: </strong> You can use the in-game reporting feature or submit a ticket to support. When submitting a ticket, please be sure to spell the </p><span>  potential violator's account name correctly so we can investigate. Both in-game reports and ticket reports will trigger further internal investigation. We also use internal chat checks, so players can receive a minor chat violation based on internal checks (even if no one reports them).</span></div> <div><p>  REPORT A CHAT VIOLATION</p><p>  <strong> To report a game violation: </strong> Please submit a ticket along with a replay. Most game violations cannot be adequately investigated without a replay, so reports without replays rarely result in sanctions.</p><p>  REPORT A GAME VIOLATION</p></div> <div><h3>  How do I appeal a sanction?</h3><p>  The appeals process remains the same. If you do not understand or do not agree with a sanction on your account, please submit a ticket to support, and we will assist you. </p><p>  APPEAL YOUR SANCTION</p><span>  Note: Fair Play bans for illegal mods and botting have always been outside of the Strike system, so Fair Play 7-day warning bans are not forgiven. A second Fair Play violation still results in a permanent ban.</span><p>  Wargaming.net reserves the right to evaluate each incident on a case by case basis. The action that may be taken may be more lenient or more severe than those listed under each category.</p></div> <p><p>
