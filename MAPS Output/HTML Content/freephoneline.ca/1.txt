The Customer acknowledges and understands that the Service does offer a limited 9-1-1 type service and that such 9-1-1 type dialing differs in important respects from traditional 9-1-1 service, as described below. The Customer agrees to advise all users who may place calls over the Service from the Customer's location of these limitations.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> BY ACTIVATING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Fongo 9-1-1 emergency dialing is only officially supported in software and on Analogue Terminal Adapters (ATAs) provided by Fongo for use with the Service.</li><li>The 9-1-1 call may be routed to a different dispatcher than that used for traditional 9-1-1 dialing. The dispatcher will be located at either the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or with a local emergency service relay provider designated for the address specified by the Customer at the time of Service subscription or as properly updated by the Customer from time to time.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><em> Fongo 9-1-1 emergency dialing has certain limitations relative to Enhanced 9-1-1 service </em>. Enhanced 9-1-1 service is the type of 9-1-1 service that is generally available on most traditional primary exchange telephone services. With Enhanced 9-1-1 service, your address information associated with your telephone number is usually available to the Public Safety Answering Point at the time of your 9-1-1 call. With Fongo 9-1-1 emergency dialing your call is being sent via the Internet rather than a traditional phone line, and as the most up to date customer address information may not arrive with this call, a different method is required to send this customer address information accurately. This method may involve the use of an intermediary emergency service operator to help ascertain your current location information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Be prepared to confirm your location and telephone number with the operator who answers the 9-1-1 call since the operator may not have this information. It is also recommended to keep in mind that Fongo is your telephone service provider because if necessary, the Fongo central call centers can contact emergency services in severe emergency situations to attempt to help. You are also encouraged not to hang up until told to do so, and to call back if you get disconnected, as immediately as possible. Please note that it may take up to three (3) days upon initial activation of service for your address information to fully propagate throughout the 9-1-1 systems. </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Fongo 9-1-1 emergency dialing may not be available during a power outage, may not be available if using the Fongo software client and the Customer's computer is malfunctioning, in the event of suspension or disconnection of the Service because of billing issues or breach of terms of service, or any disconnection or suspension of underlying broadband access service. Fongo 9-1-1 emergency dialing will also be unavailable during a broadband internet outage. If there is a power outage, the Customer may be required to reset or reconfigure their ATA, if using a Fongo ATA, prior to being able to use the Service, including for 9-1-1 dialing purposes.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If using a Fongo ATA,  9-1-1 dialing will not function correctly if the Customer moves the ATA to a location other than that provided to Fongo at the time of Service activation.  In such an event, in order to have 9-1-1 calls routed correctly, the Customer must update its service address at least three (3) days prior to moving by updating their information via the Freephoneline.ca web site.</li><li>Customer must keep its  registered location information current by updating it with Fongo to help ensure success with the emergency service operator who may assume that Customer is at the last registered address if he/she is not able to speak during a 9-1-1 call. Customer's  registered location information is used to accurately connect  to the appropriate emergency response center so that they may trigger the appropriate emergency response.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>For technical reasons associated with the possibility of network congestion, there is a possibility that the 9-1-1 call will produce a busy signal or will take longer to answer, as compared to traditional 9-1-1 calls placed from a fixed location known to the service provider.</li><li>Customer should inform any household residents, guests and other persons who may be present at the physical location where  the Fongo service is utilized of the important differences in and limitations of Fongo 9-1-1 dialing as compared with traditional Enhanced 9-1-1 service, as set out above.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Customers traveling outside of Canada will not have 9-1-1 dialing services.</li><li>911 Emergency calling service is unavailable for use with FreePhoneLine services in the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Prince Edward Island.</li><li>If Customer is not comfortable with the limitations of the Fongo 9-1-1 emergency dialing, Customer should consider having an alternate means of accessing traditional 9-1-1 or Enhanced 9-1-1 services or disconnecting the Service.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The Customer acknowledges and understands that Fongo will not be liable for any service outage and/or inability to dial 9-1-1 using the Service or to access emergency service personnel due to the 9-1-1 dialing characteristics and limitations listed herein. THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, FONGO,  ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND UNDERLYING CARRIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, DEATH OR DAMAGE TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF, OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE PROVISION OR NON-PROVISION OF 9-1-1 AND/OR EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY INABILITY ON THE PART OF CUSTOMER OR ITS END USERS TO ACCESS 9-1-1 AND/OR EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICE, AND THE CUSTOMER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS FONGO, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND UNDERLYING CARRIERS FROM ANY LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES ARISING DIRECTLY FROM THE PROVISION OR NON-PROVISION OF 9-1-1 AND/OR EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICE. </li></ul></ul> <div><td>  <strong> Freephoneline's Recommendation </strong></td><p>  
                               Due to the limitations regarding VoIP 9-1-1 calling, we recommend Freephoneline users use an alternate method to place 9-1-1 emergency calls. Why?
                               </p><ul>  <li>In Canada, phones devices will always have the ability to call 9-1-1 emergency service, even without a SIM card or cellular voice plan</li><li>9-1-1 operators may be able to use your mobile device's location to locate you</li><li>VoIP 9-1-1 calls go through a central dispatch to determine which local dispatch to send the call to whereas cellular 9-1-1 calls will automatically go to the closest local 9-1-1 dispatch</li></ul></div> <td><td>  <strong> 4.

However, all Fongo Facilities remain the property of Fongo until Customer has paid for such Fongo Facilities in full.                            </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 3.

                          In the event Fongo, at the request of the Customer, incurs unusual expense in the provision of a Service to the Customer, for example and without limitation, for special construction, the Customer shall be liable for such expenses. </p></p> <p><p>  3.7

                          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if in Fongo’s sole judgment, the Customer or the End Users violate this Article, and such violation or failure to comply poses an immediate threat of harm to or destruction of Fongo Facilities or Services, violates existing law or regulation, or puts Fongo Facilities or Services at risk with its providers of network services or other customers, Fongo shall have the right to immediately take any all steps reasonably necessary to remove such threat, including but not limited to suspension or termination of the Services immediately and without notice.</p></div> <p><p>  4.5

                          In the event Fongo determines that it is necessary to interrupt the Services or that there is a potential for Services to be interrupted for the performance of system maintenance, Fongo will use reasonable commercial efforts to notify the Customer prior to such interruption. Fongo will use reasonable commercial efforts to schedule system maintenance during non-peak hours (midnight to 6 a.m. local time). In no event shall interruption for system or emergency maintenance constitute a failure of performance by Fongo.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6. Customer responsibility </strong></p></p> <p><p>  6.1
                          The Customer shall be solely responsible for the following:</p></p> <p><p>  a) Maintaining the security and privacy of the Customer’s property and Customer’s transmissions using the Services, or the Fongo Facilities; and</p></p> <p><p>  b)

                             Fongo recognizes that its customers value the privacy of their personal information.  This Policy is intended to provide information to our customers when making decisions to provide personal information to us.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Personal Information and Our Commitment </strong>
							Personal information is  information about an identifiable individual that may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, financial information and birthday. Fongo fully supports and follows the federal government's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and any substantially similar provincial legislation, which governs commercial organizations dealing with personal information. Fongo is pleased to provide information about its practices in respect of personal information consistent with the Ten Principles of Privacy Protection upon which the federal legislation is based.  </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Principle 1 - Accountability </strong>

                            Fongo will be responsible for personal information under its control including personal information that has been transferred to a third party for processing. </p></p> <p><p>  Fongo has designated a Privacy Officer who is accountable for Fongo's compliance with the Policy's principles.  The Privacy Officer may be contacted at: <a href="mailto:PrivacyOfficer@Fongo.com" target="_blank"> PrivacyOfficer@Fongo.com </a></p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes </strong>
							Fongo collects personal information for one or more of the following purposes:</p><ul>  <li>to provide service(s) and/or products to customers;</li><li>to provide a positive customer experience, to communicate with customers and manage customer accounts (which will include, but not be limited to: billing, collection, advertising, promotion, account verification and which may be facilitated through a Fongo affiliated company); </li><li>to evaluate customers' financial status and eligibility for credit; </li><li>to identify customer needs and/or preferences; </li><li>to meet legal and regulatory requirements; </li></ul></div> <div><ul>  <li>to administer and manage its business operations; and </li><li>as otherwise required or permitted by law </li></ul><p>  Fongo will identify the purposes for which personal information is collected at the time the information is collected.  Some Fongo products may be co-branded and offered together with or via a partner company.  If you register for or use such products, you consent to both Fongo and the partner company's collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected in connection with the co-branded product.</p></div> <p><p>  Fongo may also share personal information with other Fongo affiliated companies or their agents or authorized dealers in order to offer you products or services that you may find attractive and also to provide ancillary or back-end services (such as network services, billing and collection) that will complete the service offering to the customer.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Principle 3 - Consent </strong>
							Fongo will obtain your consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, except in certain circumstances, as permitted by the law.  The form of consent may vary and may include, but is not limited to, oral consent when collected over the telephone or online consent via check-off boxes at the time of registration or when an individual uses a product or service.  To make the consent meaningful, the purposes will be stated in such a manner that the individual can reasonably understand how the information will be used or disclosed.  </p></p> <p><p>  In certain circumstances, personal information may be collected, used, or disclosed without consent of the individual.  For example, where collection of personal information is clearly in the interests of the individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way; where personal information is used  in the case of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an individual;  where the collection of personal information with that person's knowledge or consent might compromise the availability or accuracy of the information and the collection relates to the investigation of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law; and where personal information is disclosed for debt collection purposes or to comply with a subpoena, warrant or court order.</p></p> <p><p>  You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.  Please contact <a href="mailto:PrivacyOfficer@Fongo.com" target="_blank"> PrivacyOfficer@Fongo.com </a> for information on how you may withdraw your consent.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Principle 4 - Limiting Collection </strong>

Personal information will be retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Principle 6- Accuracy </strong>

                                    Fongo will take steps to help ensure that your personal information will remain as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is reasonably necessary for the intended purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  The extent to which personal information will be updated will depend upon the use of the information, taking into account the interests of the individual.

                                    Fongo shall protect your personal information with security safeguards reasonably appropriate to the sensitivity of the information in order to protect against loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.  These safeguards are physical (for example, locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices); organizational (for example, security clearances and limiting access on a "need to know" basis); and technological (for example, passwords).</p></p> <p><p>  Fongo makes their employees aware of the importance of maintaining confidentiality of personal information.  Fongo employees are governed by non-disclosure obligations.

You will be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.  For your protection, the federal legislation requires that any request for access or request to amend personal information be made in writing.  </p></p> <p><p>  In certain circumstances, Fongo may not be able to provide you access to your personal information.  Where permitted, the reasons for denying access will be provided to you.  Exceptions to the grant of an access request may include:  information that contains references to other individuals or contains confidential information, where such information cannot be severed from the record; information protected by solicitor-client privilege; information properly collected without the knowledge or consent of the individual for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of law; information generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process; and as required or permitted by law.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Principle 10- Challenging Compliance </strong>
