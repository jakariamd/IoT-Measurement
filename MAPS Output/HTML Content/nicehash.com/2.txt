After successful completion of registration, the confirmation email is sent to you. After you confirm your registration by clicking on the link in the confirmation email the NiceHash Account is created.

You may not be able to use the NiceHash Platform or Mining Services, execute withdrawals and other security sensitive operations until you regain access to your email address, registered at NiceHash Platform. If you wish to change the email address linked to your NiceHash Account, we may ask you to complete a KYC procedure for security purposes. This step serves solely for the purpose of identification in the process of regaining access to your NiceHash Account.</p></p> <p><p>  Once the NiceHash Account is created a NiceWallet is automatically created for the NiceHash Account when the request for the first deposit to the NiceWallet is made by the user. Account holder’s NiceWallet is generated by the NiceWallet provider. Account holder is strongly suggested to enhance the security of his NiceHash Account by adding an additional security step of Two-factor authentication (hereinafter “2FA”) when logging into his account, withdrawing funds from his NiceWallet or placing a new order. Account holder can enable this security feature in the settings of his NiceHash Account. In the event of losing or changing 2FA code, we may ask the Account holder to complete a KYC procedure for security reasons. This step serves solely for the purpose of identification in the process of reactivating Account holders 2FA.</p></p> <p><p>  In order to use certain functionalities of the NiceHash Platform, such as paying for the acquired hashing power, users must deposit funds to the NiceWallet, as the payments for the hashing power could be made only through NiceWallet. Hashing power providers have two options to get paid for the provided hashing power: (i) by using NiceWallet to receive the payments or (ii) by providing other Bitcoin address where the payments shall be received to. Hashing power providers provide their Bitcoin address to NiceHash by providing such details via Account holder’s profile settings or in a form of a stratum username while connecting to NiceHash stratum servers.</p></p> <p><p>  Account holder may load funds on his NiceWallet from his Secondary account. Account holder may be charged fees by the Secondary account provider or by the blockchain network for such transaction. NiceHash is not responsible for any fees charged by Secondary account providers or by the blockchain network or for the management and security of the Secondary accounts. Account holder is solely responsible for his use of Secondary accounts and Account holder agrees to comply with all terms and conditions applicable to any Secondary accounts. The timing associated with a load transaction will depend in part upon the performance of Secondary accounts providers, the performance of blockchain network and performance of the NiceWallet provider. NiceHash makes no guarantee regarding the amount of time it may take to load funds on to NiceWallet.</p></p> <p><p>  NiceWallet shall not be used by Account holders to keep, save and hold funds for longer period and also not for executing other transactions which are not related to the transactions regarding the NiceHash Platform. The NiceWallet shall be used exclusively and only for current and ongoing transactions regarding the NiceHash Platform. Account holders shall promptly withdraw any funds kept on the NiceWallet that will not be used and are not intended for the reasons described earlier. Commission fees may be charged by the NiceWallet provider, by the blockchain network or by NiceHash for any NiceWallet transactions. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the commission fees for NiceWallet transactions which are applicable at the time of the transaction. NiceHash reserves the right to change these commission fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason.</p></p> <p><p>  You have the right to use the NiceHash Account only in compliance with these Terms and other commercial terms and principles published on the NiceHash Platform. In particular, you must observe all regulations aimed at ensuring the security of funds and financial transactions.</p></p> <p><p>  Provided that the balance of funds in your NiceWallet is greater than any minimum balance requirements needed to satisfy any of your open orders, you may withdraw from your NiceWallet any amount of funds, up to the total amount of funds in your NiceWallet in excess of such minimum balance requirements, to Secondary Account, less any applicable withdrawal fees charged by NiceHash or by the blockchain network for such transaction. Withdrawals are not processed instantly and may be grouped with other withdrawal requests. Some withdrawals may require additional verification information which you will have to provide in order to process the withdrawal. It may take up to 24 hours before withdrawal is fully processed and distributed to the Blockchain network. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform for more information about the withdrawal fees and withdrawal processing. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason.</p></p> <p><p>  You have the right to close the NiceHash Account.

Hashing power buyer acknowledges and agrees that NiceHash is not acting as his broker, intermediary, agent or advisor or in any fiduciary capacity. NiceHash executes the order in set order amount minus NiceHash’s processing fee. Once the order is successfully submitted the order amount starts to decrease in real time according to the payments for the provided hashing power.</p></p> <p><p>  Hashing power buyer agrees to pay applicable processing fee to NiceHash for provided services. The NiceHash’s fees are deducted from Hashing power buyer’s NiceWallet once the whole order is exhausted and completed. Please refer to the NiceHash Platform, for more information about the fees which are applicable at the time of provision of services. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason.

If an order has been partially executed, Hashing power buyer may cancel the unexecuted remainder of the order. In this case the NiceHash’s processing fee will apply only for the partially executed order. NiceHash reserves the right to refuse any order cancellation request once the order has been submitted.</p></p> <div><p>  Selling Hashing Power and the Provision of Hashing Power</p><p>  In order to submit the hashing power to the NiceHash stratum server the Hashing power provider must first point its Hashing power rig to the NiceHash stratum server. Hashing power provider is solely responsible for configuration of his Hashing power rig.</p><p>  The Hashing power provider gets paid by Hashing power buyers for all validated and accepted work that his Hashing power rig has produced. The provided hashing power is validated by NiceHash’s stratum engine and validator. Once the hashing power is validated the Hashing power provider is entitled to receive the payment for his work. NiceHash logs all validated hashing power which was submitted by the Hashing power provider. The Hashing power provider receives the payments of current globally weighted average price on to his NiceWallet or his selected personal Bitcoin address. The payments are made periodically depending on the height of payments. NiceHash reserves the right to hold the payments any time and for any reason by indicating the reason, especially if the payments represent smaller values.

Hashing power provider which has not submitted any hashing power to the NiceHash stratum server for a period of 90 days agrees that a processing fee of 0.00001000 BTC or less, depending on the unpaid mining balance, will be deducted from his unpaid mining balance. NiceHash reserves the right to change these fees according to the provisions to change these Terms at any time for any reason. The changed fees will apply only for the NiceHash Services provided after the change of the fees.</p></p> <p><p>  NiceHash will attempt, on a commercially reasonable basis, to execute the provision of Hashing power providers’ hashing power on the Hashing power marketplace under these Terms according to the best-effort delivery approach.
