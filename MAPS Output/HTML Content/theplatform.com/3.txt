<div><h1>  Our Privacy Policy</h1><p>  <strong> Additional Notices: </strong></p></div> <div><h2>  Table of contents</h2></div> <div><h2>  Introduction</h2><p>  We know you care about your privacy and the protection of your <a href="#/privacy/overlays/Personal-Information" target="_blank"> personal information. </a> We also know it is our responsibility to be clear about how we protect your information. We designed this Privacy Policy to do just that. It explains the types of personal information we collect, and how we collect, use, maintain, protect, and share this information. This Privacy Policy also tells you about the rights and choices you may have when it comes to your personal information.</p></div> <p><p>  Some of what we say in our Privacy Policy is required by law, and may at times seem long and complicated, but we’ve worked hard to try to make our Privacy Policy easy to understand and provide examples where possible. The <a href="/privacy" target="_blank"> Xfinity Privacy Center </a> includes more information about:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>How to review and manage your personal information and account activity</li><li>How to manage your preference, including setting your marketing and advertising preferences, and restricting certain uses and sharing</li><li>How you can better protect yourself online</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You can review this Privacy Policy and the information in the Xfinity Privacy Center anytime. If you still have questions, you can <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/xfinityassistant" target="_blank"> contact us </a> for more information.</p></p> <div><h2>  When the Privacy Policy applies</h2><p>  This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect when you use or interact with the <a href="#/privacy/overlays/Xfinity-branded" target="_blank"> business entities, products, services, networks, and platforms </a>, including our websites, mobile apps, and other services and devices where this policy is referenced. These may include Xfinity-branded services, Comcast-branded Services, and other products and services we deliver. This Privacy Policy also applies when you otherwise interact with us. We’ll refer to all of these as our “Services” in this Privacy Policy. It also applies to the information we collect about you from third parties. </p></div> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy does <strong> not  </strong>apply to the <a href="#/privacy/overlays/Other-products" target="_blank"> other products, services, websites, and applications </a> (mobile or television) that you may use or interact with through Xfinity platforms.</p></p> <div><p>  Learn more about when the Privacy Policy applies</p><p>  Because this Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices for all of our Services, some parts may not apply to you. For example, if you do not subscribe to Xfinity Voice (home phone service) or Xfinity Mobile, we will not collect call detail information. If you do not subscribe to Xfinity Home, we will not collect home security event information.</p><p>  Some Services may have additional privacy practices that may be described to you in different ways, such as in a separate contract for Comcast Business Services. To the extent there is an overlap between this Privacy Policy and a Service-specific privacy policy, the Service-specific policy or agreement will control with respect to that Service.</p></div> <p><p>  This Policy does <em> not  </em>apply to the non-Xfinity products, services, websites, and applications that you may use through the Xfinity platforms and we are not responsible for the practices of the companies providing those offerings. For example, if you subscribe to Xfinity Internet and visit a news or shopping website, the privacy policy for that website will apply. If you use one of our platforms to use another company’s streaming service, the privacy policy for that streaming service will apply to information it collects about your activity within the app. Likewise, if you connect your smart thermostat to your Xfinity Home security and automation service, the privacy policy of the smart thermostat company will apply to the information it collects. For more information about how these non-Xfinity products, services, websites, and applications use your information, please review their privacy policies.</p></p> <div><h2>  The personal information we collect and how we collect it</h2><p>  To provide you with our Services, we collect your personal information. This can include information that does not personally identify you -  such as device numbers, IP addresses, and account numbers. It may also include information that does personally identify you, such as your name, address, and telephone number. We call any information that identifies you "personally identifiable information" or "PII."</p><p>  
If you allow others to use your Services, we will also collect personal information about those individuals. If you use our Services through someone else’s account, we will collect
information about you, but it may not identify who you are to us. We may also collect information about you from <a href="#/privacy/overlays/Third-Parties" target="_blank"> third parties </a>.</p></div> <p><p>

To learn more about this, please read our <a href="/privacy/policy/cookienotice" target="_blank"> Cookie Notice </a></p></p> <div><p>  Learn more about when and with whom we share information</p><p>  <strong> The Comcast family of businesses </strong></p><p>  If Comcast shares the personal information it collects about you with separate Comcast companies, such as NBCUniversal-branded companies, to use for their own purposes, we will first give you the choice to opt out of or opt in to any sharing in the <a href="/privacy/your-privacy-choices" target="_blank"> Xfinity Privacy Preferences Center </a>.</p><p>  <strong> Account owners and other authorized users </strong></p></div> <p><p>  We may share information about a customer's account and use of a Service to the primary account owner following appropriate authentication. The primary account owner may also allow others to see information on the account.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Service providers </strong></p><p>  To provide and support the Services, sometimes we use other companies as service providers to transmit, collect, process, or store information for us. We require these service providers to treat the information we share with them as confidential and to use it only for providing their services to us. These include:</p><p>  BILLING AND COLLECTION PROVIDERS</p><p>  Such as payment processors and organizations that assist us in assessing your credit and payment status</p></div> <p><p>  ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, AND TAX PROVIDERS</p></p> <div><p>  INSURANCE PROVIDERS</p><p>  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PROVIDERS</p><p>  Such as firms that provide consultative services, assist with improving our programming, provide legal services, or supply project-based resources and assistance</p><p>  ANALYTICS SERVICES</p><p>  Including entities that analyze traffic to and on our websites, analyze how our Services are used, and assist with identifying and communicating with potential customers</p><p>  MARKETING, ADVERTISING, AND SALES</p><p>  Entities that assist us in creating and executing marketing, advertising, and sales programs, including order application processing, and printing, mailing, and electronic communications services</p></div> <div><p>  SECURITY PROVIDERS</p><p>  Such as entities that assist with security incident verification and response, service notifications, fraud prevention, identity verification and management, and authentication</p><p>  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS</p><p>  Such as entities that assist with website design, hosting, and maintenance, data and software storage, and network operations</p><p>  CUSTOMER SERVICE SUPPORT</p><p>  Including services related to our call centers, installation, maintenance, and repair services</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Third parties </strong></p><p>  We do not sell, and have never sold, information that personally identifies who you are to anyone.

In that instance, we will make sure you give us clear direction about what you want us to share and with whom, before we share that information.</p></div> <div><p>  Other sharing with third parties can include:</p><p>  SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES</p><p>  You may interact with parts of our Services that cause information to be published to your social networks. For example, you may click on a Facebook "like" button, which publishes to your Facebook account that you "like" one of our Services. On those parts of our websites with social network functionality, a social network may be able to collect information about you. For example, if a page contains a Facebook "like" button, Facebook may be able to collect data about your visit to that page, even if you don't click on the "like" button. To control this sharing of information, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or sign out of it before you use our Services.</p></div> <div><p>  ONLINE ADVERTISING PARTNERS</p><p>  We may use cookies or other technology to deliver personalized advertising to you when you visit other websites, including advertising based on the products and services you viewed on our Services. We also allow our partners, including advertisers and service providers, to use cookies and similar tracking technologies when you use our Services. For more information about the use of
cookies and other technologies on our online Services, please see the <a href="/privacy/policy/cookienotice" target="_blank"> Cookies Notice </a>.</p></div> <div><p>  AUDIENCE MEASUREMENT AND ANALYTICS COMPANIES</p><p>  We work with business partners to help us measure and analyze how our customers are using our Services. For video, this includes assessing which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, whether people are watching advertisements, and what programming and video content we will carry on the Services. It also includes determining how our customers prefer to view certain kinds of programming when they use our Services, such as whether they like to watch certain programs live, or if they prefer to view them on demand, on mobile devices, or online. Our business partners may compile this information into reports with aggregated and anonymous statistics that are then made commercially available (for example, a ratings report that indicates what percentage of viewers watched a particular program live vs. on-demand). Xfinity Stream includes Nielsen's proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, like Nielsen's television ratings. By visiting www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy, users can access more information about the measurement software and learn about their choices with regard to Nielsen's measurement.</p></div> <div><p>  NON-XFINITY APPS AND PARTNERS</p><p>  Certain Services enable you to interact directly with technology provided by other companies, such as using a <a href="#/privacy/overlays/Non-Xfinity-Video-app" target="_blank"> non-Xfinity video app </a> available through our Services, or accessing our Services through <a href="#/privacy/overlays/Another-company-Platform" target="_blank"> another company’s platform or device </a>. When you use our Services in connection with any technology provided by another company, you are directing us to interact with that company and that company may collect information from you and our Services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of other companies. For more information about how those companies use your information, please review their privacy policies. For more information about non-Xfinity apps supported on our video Services, please visit <a href="https://my.xfinity.com/privacy/providers" target="_blank"> https://my.xfinity.com/privacy/providers </a>. </p></div> <span><span>  Certain apps may also run using technology provided by Metrological, a separate Comcast company not subject to this Privacy Policy, whose privacy practices are described at <a href="www.metrological.com/privacypolicy" target="_blank"> www.metrological.com/privacypolicy </a>.</span></span> <div><p>  CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES</p><p>  We disclose information that personally identifies you to consumer reporting agencies that may be subject to other laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act. These disclosures may include information that helps validate your identity, such as your name, current and former addresses, contact information, Social Security number, government-issued identifiers, your payment history and account status, and other identifying information.</p><p>  PUBLIC SAFETY AUTHORITIES</p></div> <p><p>  If you have our Xfinity Voice service, Comcast will disclose your name and contact information to public safety authorities such as 911/E911 and related emergency services.</p></p> <p><p>  DIRECTORY SERVICES, ASSISTANCE, AND CALLER ID</p></p> <p><p>  Your name, address, and telephone number may be sent to publishers to be printed in directories and posted in online directories. Once that information is printed or posted online, it is outside of our control and may be sorted or repackaged and made available again in different formats by anyone, including data aggregators, for a variety of purposes, including marketing. For a fee, you can choose to have a nonpublished number, which means that Comcast will not provide your name, address, and telephone number for publishing in the phone book and online directories. You can also choose to have a published number, but choose the "omit address feature," which means we will not provide your street address for publishing in the phone book and online directories. If initiating service online, select "non-published" option, otherwise call <a href="tel:18009346489" target="_blank"> 1-800-XFINITY </a> to sign up.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also make your number, name, and address available to directory assistance (411) providers. If you have a nonpublished number, Comcast will not make your number available through directory assistance. Comcast may still share your name and address with the 411 provider when specified by law (but the provider is not authorized to share your (non-published number).</p></p> <p><p>  Please note: While the non-published feature will keep your name, address, and telephone number out of printed and online directories over which Comcast exercises control, even a non-published phone number may exist in databases not controlled by Comcast - if, for example, your present telephone number or address was previously published under your name, or if you provided this information to businesses or government agencies. One way to help protect your privacy may be to request assignment of a new telephone number (with which your name has not previously been associated). You may also want to activate Caller ID Blocking or select the do-not-call option.</p></p> <p><p>  Caller ID provides your name and telephone number to the person you are calling - even if you have a non-published number. Per Line Caller ID Blocking will automatically block Caller ID for all calls you make from your registered telephone number and can be activated by calling <a href="tel:18009346489" target="_blank"> 1-800-XFINITY </a>. Per Call Caller ID Blocking will block name and number on a per-call basis and can be activated by dialing *86 before each call you want to block.</p></p> <div><p>  POTENTIAL PURCHASERS OF OUR BUSINESS</p><p>  If we enter into a potential or actual merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, then information about you and your subscription will, in most cases, be shared or transferred as part of the transaction. This includes information that personally identifies you. If this Policy will be changed as a result of such a transaction, you should refer below under "<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/privacy/policy#changes" target="_blank"> Changes to the Privacy Policy. </a>"</p></div> <div><p>  GOVERNMENT AND OTHER ENTITIES WHEN REQUIRED BY LAW OR TO PROTECT COMCAST AND OTHERS</p><p>  There are times when we may be required by law to disclose information about you to third parties. This may happen with or without your consent, and with or without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.</p><p>  If you subscribe to our Xfinity Video service, Comcast may be required to disclose information that personally identifies you to a governmental entity in response to a court order. In this case, the Cable Act requires that you be given the opportunity to appear in a court proceeding to contest any claims made in support of the court order, and the governmental entity must offer clear and convincing evidence that you are reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case. For more information, see <a href="#your-rights" target="_blank"> "Your Rights and Our Limitations Under Federal Laws." </a></p></div> <p><p>  If you subscribe to the Xfinity Internet, Voice, Mobile, or Home security and automation Services, Comcast may be required to disclose information that personally identifies you to a governmental entity in response to a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, depending on the type of information sought. We may be prohibited from notifying you of any such disclosures by the terms of the legal process.</p></p> <p><p>  A non-governmental entity, such as a civil litigant, can seek information that personally identifies you or your use of the Xfinity Video, Internet, or Voice Services only pursuant to a court order, and we are required by the Cable Act to notify you of such court order. If Comcast is required to give information that personally identifies you to a private third party in response to a civil court order for these or other Services, we will notify you prior to making such disclosure unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also disclose information that personally identifies you as permitted by law and without your consent when it is necessary to protect our customers, employees, or property; in emergency situations; or to enforce our rights under our terms of service and policies.</p></p> <div><h2>  How we protect your information</h2><p>  We follow industry-standard practices to secure the information we collect to prevent the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of any personal information we collect and maintain. These security practices include technical, administrative, and physical safeguards, which may vary, depending on the type and sensitivity of the information. Although we take the responsibility of safeguarding your personal information seriously, no security measures are 100% effective and we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information. Comcast also takes additional steps to increase the security and reliability of customer communications. We do not read your outgoing or incoming email, file attachments, video mail, private chat, or instant messages. However, we (along with our service providers) use software and hardware tools to help prevent and block "spam" emails, viruses, spyware, and other harmful or unwanted communications and programs from being sent and received over Comcast.net email and the Comcast Services. To help protect you and the Services against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs, these tools may automatically scan your emails, video mails, instant messages, file attachments, and other files and communications. We do not use these tools for marketing or advertising.</p></div> <div><h2>  How long we keep your information</h2><p>  We keep your personal information for different lengths of time depending on the type of information and the business and legal requirements. For example, if you are a customer, we keep information that personally identifies you as long as you subscribe to one or more of our Services. If you no longer subscribe to a Service, we still may need that information for business and legal requirements, such as to protect against fraud, calculate taxes, or respond to legal requests. Other information is deleted automatically after a set period of time, often set by law, unless we are legally required to hold it longer, such as for pending litigation. We destroy, de-identify, or anonymize the information when it is no longer needed in identifiable form.</p></div> <div><h2>  The choices you have to control our use of personal information</h2><p>  You have many choices about how we communicate with you and how we use or share your information. You can manage these settings in the <a href="/privacy/manage-preference" target="_blank"> Xfinity Privacy Preferences Center. </a> If you change your mind, you can update your preferences any time.</p><p>  Learn more about your privacy choices</p><p>  <strong> For your convenience, we have created the Xfinity Privacy Preferences Center  </strong><strong> where you can manage: </strong></p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>how we process personal information linked to your account for certain uses associated with audience measurement, analytics, and personalized advertising for third-party products and services based on your interests</li><li>whether we use your sensitive personal information for personalized recommendations, advertising, and marketing</li><li>your preferences regarding which cookies are stored by our website in your browser when you visit </li><li>

If you change your mind, you can return any time to update it. Some of the choices are limited to our use of certain customer information and may require you to sign in to your account.</p></p> <p><p>  If you subscribe to Xfinity voice service, when you are interacting with one of our customer service representatives, such as on a call, in our offices, or during an online chat session, we may ask you for your oral consent to the use of your customer proprietary network information or “CPNI” for the purpose of reviewing your account and providing you with an offer for other products and services. If you provide consent, Comcast may use your CPNI only for the duration of that telephone call or discussion in order to offer you additional services.

The Cable Act permits Comcast to use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information about you. Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you specifically; it does not include de-identified, anonymous, aggregate, or other data that does not identify you. We may collect personally identifiable information when it is necessary to render cable services or other services to you and to detect unauthorized reception or use of the services. We may use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information about you for additional purposes with your prior written or electronic consent. The Cable Act also permits Comcast to disclose personally identifiable information if the disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, the cable service or other services provided to you; required by law or legal process; or limited to your name and address, subject to your opt-out consent. The frequency of any disclosure of personally identifiable information varies in accordance with our business needs and activities as described in this Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  If you believe that you have been aggrieved by any act of ours in violation of the Cable Act or other applicable laws, we encourage you to contact us directly at <a href="mailto:Comcast_Privacy@comcast.com" target="_blank"> Comcast_Privacy@comcast.com </a> in order to resolve your question or concern. You may also enforce the limitations imposed on us by the Cable Act as applicable with respect to your personally identifiable information through a civil lawsuit seeking damages, attorneys' fees, and litigation costs. Other rights and remedies may be available to you under federal or other applicable laws as well.</p></p> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy neither supersedes, enhances, nor modifies any arbitration agreement to which you may be bound as a subscriber to one or more of the Services.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> The Communications Act and CPNI </strong></p><p>  Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"), provides additional privacy protections for information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of your use of telecommunications services, including Xfinity Voice and Mobile Services, and the information about those services contained on your bills for those Services. This information is known as customer proprietary network information or "CPNI". CPNI does not include your name, address, or telephone number, which is defined by the Communications Act as "subscriber list information". However, that information is otherwise considered personally identifiable information.</p></div> <p><p>  If you are a customer of Xfinity Voice or Mobile Service, or another Service that is subject to these requirements, you have the right, and Comcast has a duty, under the Communications Act and other applicable laws, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. In addition, the FCC's rules provide additional privacy protections and choices regarding use and sharing that are specific to our Voice and Mobile service that we describe in this Policy.</p></p> <div><h2>  Additional information regarding other laws and individual rights</h2><p>  Your privacy may be impacted differently depending on where you live.
