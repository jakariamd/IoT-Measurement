<div><h1>  Privacy Policy</h1><p>  This privacy notice applies to AdGlare. ("AdGlare", "we", "our", "us").</p><p>  The privacy of your data - and it is your data, not ours! - is a big deal to us. To be crystal clear - AdGlare does not and will not ever sell your data (nor your users' data) to third parties. We'll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or squash a software bug.</p></div> <div><h2>  Identity & Access</h2><p>  
      When you sign up for AdGlare, we ask for your name, company name, and email address. That's just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties.
    </p><p>  
      When you pay for AdGlare, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn't ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for account history, invoicing, and billing support.
    </p></div> <p><p>  
      When you write AdGlare with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep a transcript of that correspondence and your email address for future reference.
