			A security problem relates to how files and programs are sent and received between web sites and a computer. The Internet works by sending information from computer to computer until the information reaches its destination. So when data is sent from point A to point B, every computer in between has an opportunity to look at what's being sent. Also, with no security protection, a user could run or download files and programs from the Internet that can damage the computer and the information stored on it.
