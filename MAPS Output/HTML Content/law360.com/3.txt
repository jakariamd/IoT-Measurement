</p></p> <div><small>  ADVERTISEMENT</small><small>  ADVERTISEMENT</small></div> <div><h4>  Expert Analysis</h4><p>  Attorneys at Ropes & Gray explore potential prohibitions, notification requirements and covered transactions under President Joe Biden's recent executive order, which marks an unprecedented expansion of U.S. regulation of investment activity.
</p><p>  As lawmakers nationwide grapple with how to protect children's activities online, tension has emerged between the need to protect their privacy and the need to confirm their age, as age verification often requires children to provide personal information, which can pose a serious threat, says Paula Bruening at Achieved Compliance Solutions.
</p></div> <p><p>  Although the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General's final information blocking enforcement rule is a step toward regulating conduct, there is still no rule for appropriate disincentives for provider-actors, leaving a significant enforcement gap, say attorneys at Sheppard Mullin.
</p></p> <p><p>  The president’s recent executive order on outbound investment describes prohibited transactions and a notification process, but the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s actions suggest upcoming regulations will leave investors with the risky determination of whether investments are prohibited or require notification, say attorneys at Morgan Lewis.
</p></p> <p><p>  A new rule from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission aims to increase cybersecurity resiliency, but may only force regulated entities — particularly those in the health care space — to face a far more complicated environment with increased strategic and litigation risks, say Bess Hinson and Angad Chopra at Holland & Knight. 
</p></p> <p><p>  The Chinese cybersecurity regulator’s recently imposed restrictions on Micron and newly effective enforcement procedures mark a new era of privacy regulation in the country, so multinational companies with operations there should ensure their compliance programs are updated accordingly, say Lorna Chen and Jieni Ji at Shearman.
</p></p> <p><p>  As the battle for top talent continues post-pandemic, many firms are attempting to attract employees with progressive hybrid working environments — and supporting caregivers before, during and after an extended leave is a critically important way to retain top talent, says Manar Morales at The Diversity & Flexibility Alliance.
</p></p> <p><p>  The speed at which artificial intelligence is developing will likely outpace the legislative response, and two recently filed class actions naming OpenAI as a defendant raise the question of whether existing laws may be used to place some meaningful guardrails on the development of AI, says Thomas Carey at Sunstein.
</p></p> <p><p>  Financial institutions should understand the conceptions and misconceptions about artificial intelligence likely to influence regulators, and proactively study potential adverse impacts and establish use case strategies and other guardrails for deploying AI, say attorneys at Jones Day.
</p></p> <p><p>  A recent ruling from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, as well as past rulings across the country, indicates that the judicial privilege is applicable to alleged violations of wiretapping laws, so attorneys presented with audio evidence beneficial to their case should not fear being sued, says David Scott at Kang Haggerty.
</p></p> <p><p>  As the EU's groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence Act moves to the final stage of adoption, its proposed language provides valuable insight into the substantial compliance hurdles that companies across all jurisdictions will face in using generative AI, so U.S. organizations should consider what they can be doing now, say Vivien Peaden and Alexander Koskey at Baker Donelson.
</p></p> <p><p>  When drafting guidelines on generative artificial intelligence use for organizations that have a heightened need to safeguard their intellectual property, in-house counsel will need to address some gray areas that have become difficult to navigate in order to set their company up for success, say Enrique Abarca and Tanner Jarrell at Nabors Corporate.
</p></p> <p><p>  Amid increasing scrutiny and litigation over uses of online tracking technology, it's critical for companies under the purview of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to carefully navigate website cookies' collection of protected health information, which may happen without website operators' knowledge, says Richard Sheinis at Hall Booth.
</p></p> <p><p>  In light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent, and final, cybersecurity disclosure requirements, company leaders should undertake four factual assessments now to prepare their companies to respond quickly and agilely to the seemingly inevitable cyberattack, says Jennie Wang VonCannon at Crowell & Moring.
</p></p> <p><p>  Before federal contractors adopt AI tools to simplify their proposal writing, they should ask questions about how a given AI tool’s model was developed, and consider the procedures they will need to avoid cookie-cutter submissions and ensure accuracy, privacy and security, among other practical and legal considerations, say attorneys at Wiley.
