Our products and services operate on a global scale and as such we continuously monitor the dynamic global privacy landscape and adapt accordingly to ensure complete compliance with privacy laws including the European Union's GDPR and California's CCPA. If you are a resident of California, we refer you to our CCPA Privacy Notice, found at the end of this policy.</p></div> <p><p>  This Privacy Policy addresses both users who actively choose to use our services, as described below and also to individuals whose personal data we may process as part of our operation.</p></p> <p><p>  Please feel free to read on for a detailed breakdown of our privacy policy or contact us with any questions regarding our policy or data legislation compliance.</p></p> <p><p>  Bright Data ("<b> Bright Data </b>", "<b> we </b>", or "<b> us </b>") is the owner of the website brightdata.com ("<b> the Site </b>"), the Bright Data software ("<b> the Software </b>"), the Bright Data SDK ("<b> the SDK </b>") and any accompanying services, features, content, and applications offered by us (collectively referred herein as "<b> the Services </b>"). We are concerned about your privacy and have designed this Privacy Policy in order to help you decide whether to use the Services and to provide all required information about our privacy practices. If applicable to you, by accessing and using the Services, or providing information to us in other formats, you agree and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time and consent to the collection and use of information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy carefully and to periodically refer to it so that you understand it and any subsequent changes made to it.

This is information that is un-identified and non-identifiable, which is generated by a user's activity. Such non-personal information may include the following information - browser type, web pages you visit, time spent on those pages, access times and dates.</li><li>Personal Information. Personal information is information that identifies you or may identify you. The Personal Information we collect and retain includes your IP address, your name and email address, identifying documents (driver license/ID/passport), office/home address, screen name, payment and billing information or other information we may ask from time to time as will be required for the on-boarding process and services provisioning. In some cases, we may record audio or video calls with you, in order to comply with User compliance evaluation requirements we are subject to and our internal guidelines. When you create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using your credentials with a designated third party website or service ("<b> Third Party Account </b>") such as Gmail®. Doing so will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your Third Party Account, such as user-name, email address, profile picture, birthday, gender and preferences. Any Anonymous Information that is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is treated by us as Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Registering through social network account: When you register or sign-in to the Services via your social network account (e.g., Facebook, Google+), we will have access to basic information from your social network account, such as your full name, home address, email address, birthdate, profile picture, friends list, personal description, as well as any other information you made publicly available on such account or agreed to share with us. At all times, we will abide by the terms, conditions and restrictions of the social network platform.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If we combine non-personal information with personal information we will treat the combined information as personal information.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also collect publicly posted personal data from various online sources. Such information will include, in most cases, basic contact information, such as name, email and job title ("<b> Public Data </b>").</p></p> <p><p>  Processing of User Data is necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations towards you and providing you with our services, to protect our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations.</p></p> <p><p>  Processing of Public Data is done in accordance with our legitimate interest, as long as such interest does not override your fundamental rights and freedom.</p></p> <p><p>  We use User Data in order to provide you with the Service and to comply with our legal requirements and internal guidelines. This means that we will use the information to set up your account, provide you with support regarding the Service, communicate with you for updates, marketing offers or concerns you may have and conduct statistical and analytical research to improve the Service.

However, when other customers (e.g. other peers in the network) access the web using your IP address, the IP address may be visible to them, for example by way of looking up their current IP address.</p></p> <p><p>  We may also share your Personal Information and other information in special cases if we have good reason to believe that it is necessary to: (1) comply with law, regulation, subpoena or court order; (2) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security, violation of our policies or technical issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any other agreements between you and us, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (4) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our partners, our affiliates, users, or the public.</p></p> <p><p>  Note that we are based in Israel and some of the data recipients listed above may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

Our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations. We use measures and procedures that substantially reduce the risks of data misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe. If you become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately. We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.</p></p> <p><p>  We strive to give you ways to update your information quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.

Retention periods shall be determined taking into account the type of information collected and the purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy outdated, unused information at the earliest reasonable time.</p></p> <p><p>  We may rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at any time and at our own discretion.</p></p> <p><p>  Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we are not responsible for the accuracy, correctness, and security of any of the information we gather, store, and disclose to you or to anyone else.</p></p> <p><p>  Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent you disclose your information to other parties or sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party that you choose to disclose information to.</p></p> <p><p>  In the event of a change of ownership or control of all or a part of Bright Data, including without limitation through acquisition, merger, or sale, we reserve the right to transfer all or part of the User Data and Public Data we store in our systems.
