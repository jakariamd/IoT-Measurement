</span><span>  Dispute Resolution</span><p>  You agree that these Terms
and any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, issue or request for relief
between you and</p><span>   HIKVISION arising out
of or relating to these Terms or HIKVISION Services (collectively, “Disputes”)
will be governed by</span><span>   and construed
in accordance with the laws of the People’s Republic of China, without giving
effect to any conflict of laws</span><span>   principles
that may provide the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</span></div> <p><p>  If a Dispute arises between
you and HIKVISION, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns. You
agree that you</p></p> <div><span>   will</span><span>   notify</span><span>   HIKVISION</span><span>   about</span><span>   any</span><span>   Dispute</span><span>

or</span><span>   HIKVISION Services by
contacting HIKVISION at </span><span>  support@hikvision.com.

submit to binding arbitration all disputes and claims arising out of or
relating, in any way, to</p><span>   these Terms
or any of HIKVISION Services, on an individual and purely bilateral, non-class/non-representative
bases.</span><span>   Arbitration on an individual
basis is the exclusive remedy for any claims which might otherwise be brought
on a class,</span><span>   collective or
representative basis between you and HIKVISION. These Terms will be governed by
the laws of the People’s</span></div> <div><span>   Republic</span><span>   of</span><span>   China</span><span>   and</span><span>   shall</span><span>   be</span><span>   submitted</span><span>   exclusively</span><span>   to</span><span>   the</span><span>   China</span><span>   International</span><span>   Economic</span><span>

rules. Unless otherwise precluded by law, you and</span><span>   HIKVISION shall each separately pay your or its own attorneys’
fees and costs. You agree that if any provision of this</span></div> <span><span>   arbitration agreement is held by an arbitrator or a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, that</span></span> <span><span>   provision shall be struck from the
agreement to arbitrate, and the remainder of the arbitration agreement shall
remain in full</span></span> <span><span>   force and effect
consistent with applicable law. However, the entire agreement to arbitrate
shall be void if the provisions</span></span> <span><span>   above
waiving or precluding class arbitration proceedings are found to be invalid,
unenforceable, or void for any reason.</span></span> <div><h1>  23.</h1><span>   
</span><span>  Limitation on Claims</span><p>  Regardless of any statute or
law to the contrary, any dispute arising out of or related to your use of

the use of</p><span>   HIKVISION Services, and
these terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written
understandings or agreements</span><span>   between
HIKVISION and you regarding HIKVISION Services. HIKVISION’s failure to enforce
any right or provision in</span></div> <span><span>   these Terms
will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or of any other rights
or provisions in these Terms. If a</span></span> <span><span>   court
or tribunal should find that one or more rights or provisions set forth in these
Terms are invalid, you agree that the</span></span> <div><span>   remainder
of the Terms will remain in full force and effect and that the invalid
provision will be enforceable to the fullest</span><span>
