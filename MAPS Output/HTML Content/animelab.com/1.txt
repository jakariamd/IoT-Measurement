If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Content or by the Third-Party Service that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Content (<em> e.g. </em>, by using a hashtag associated with SPE or Sony group companies in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Content or otherwise by SPE and Sony group companies.
