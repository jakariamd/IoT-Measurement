For further information regarding data protection in a specific country and/or region, please refer to the privacy policy tailored for that specific country and/or region via <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/en/choose-your-location/" target="_blank"> https://www.tp-link.com/en/choose-your-location/ </a>. You may consult the respective privacy policy for your residing country/region for your data protection.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> What Products and Services does this policy cover </strong></p><p>  (1) TP-Link branded hardware, firmware, and software products (“Products”);</p><p>  (2) website(s) that may be accessed at https://www.tp-link.com, https://www.kasasmart.com, and https://www.vigi.com (“Sites”);</p><p>  (3) services, including on and through the Products, and technical support and services accessible through the Site(s) (“Web Apps”);</p><p>  (4) software that may be downloaded to your smartphone or tablet to access services (“Mobile Apps”); </p></div> <p><p>  (5) subscription services, including services that can be accessed using Web Apps and Mobile Apps (“Subscription Services”).

YOUR INFORMATION WE COLLECT </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We collect and use different types of data from and about you, including:</p></p> <p><p>  1.1 Personal Information You Provide to Us:</p></p> <div><p>  You provide information to us when you：</p><ul>  <li>search for products or services on our website；</li><li>place order in our stores;</li><li>download, stream, view, or use content on a device (camera usually), or through a service or application on a device;</li><li>provide information in Your Account (and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address or mobile number when you register and use our Products and Services) or Your Profile;</li><li>configure your settings on, provide data access permissions for, or interact with a TP-Link device or service;</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>communicate with us by phone, e-mail, livechat, or otherwise;</li><li>complete a questionnaire, a contest entry form, or beta testing application;</li><li>upload or stream images, videos, or other files to the cloud Services;</li><li>post new topics on the TP-Link Community forum.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  As a result of those actions, you might supply us with information such as:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>identifying information such as your name, address, and phone numbers;</li><li>payment information;</li><li>your location information;</li><li>people, addresses, and phone numbers listed in your Addresses;</li><li>email address;</li><li>content of livechats, posts, and emails to us;</li><li>personal description and photograph in Your Profile;</li><li>images and videos collected by cameras or stored in connection with subscribed cloud services;</li><li>device log files and configurations, including Wi-Fi credentials, if you choose to automatically synchronize them with your other devices or third-party accounts.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  1.2 Automatic Information</p></p> <p><p>  We automatically collect information about you when you access or use our Products and Services. For example, when you connect hardware devices or third-party services to your account, those hardware devices may report usage information to the Services, and the Services may read, process, and store this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Such information is usually associated with the usage of the particular hardware device or third-party service, such as when a motion sensor senses motion. The Services will receive information about the device activation, as well as the information that you have chosen to associate with the Product or Service such as device name, group name, and location name. The type of the Product or Service from which information is received will change the types and quantities of information that is received.</p></p> <p><p>  We also collect the information about how you interact with our Site and Services, which may include the pages accessed and links clicked on our site, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, MAC address, access times, location, mobile device information, operating system, browser type, certain demographic information, application information, and other information associated with how you interact with the Site and Services. We will collect a device’s browser history and access time when the device is under the control of the Parental Controls feature, such as the Parental Controls feature on Deco Products, in order to better monitor the device which is under control. We will record and analyze a device's attempted URL connections and block access to malicious websites (such as phishing / fraud / fake websites) only when the device has the Real-Time Protection feature enabled. Data will no longer be collected after you turn off this feature.</p></p> <p><p>  1.3 Information from Other Sources</p></p> <p><p>  We may receive data from other sources including, but not limited to, third-party service providers which you have integrated into our Products and Services and/or voluntarily have provided with data and/or from our authorized partners, or others that we use to fulfill our obligations to you as a customer. You should carefully and diligently review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third-party products and services, and we will consider your decision to use those third-party products and services with our Products and Services to be a representation to us that you have consented to the third parties’ terms and practices.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.

In the event that we elect to terminate your account, we will try to provide advance notice to you prior to termination so that you are able to retrieve any important User Content stored in your account.

If we charged your credit card or other accounts prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. Additional Terms may apply. If a product you purchased from TP-Link is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Security </strong></p><p>  Any usernames and passwords used for the Services are for individual use only.

TP-Link may suspend any users whose conduct or postings are under investigation and may remove such material from its servers as it deems appropriate and without notice. If TP-Link believes, in its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms has occurred, it may edit or modify any submission, posting or emails, remove the material permanently, cancel postings, warn users, suspend users and passwords, terminate accounts, or take other corrective action it deems appropriate. TP-Link will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing TP-Link to disclose the identity of anyone posting any emails, or publishing or otherwise making available any materials that are believed to violate these Terms.
