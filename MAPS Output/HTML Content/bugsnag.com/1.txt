Privacy Shield Framework</h2><p>  In accordance with the Court of Justice of the European Union’s (CJEU) invalidation of the Privacy Shield Framework as a valid transfer mechanism, we no longer rely on the EU–US Privacy Shield Framework as a legal mechanism for transfers of personal data of its EU and/or UK based users to the US. However, to demonstrate our commitment to privacy, we maintain our adherence to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, recourse, enforcement and liability (the “Privacy Shield Principals”). We remain subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern, but this does not limit any more protective rights you may have under applicable laws. In the context of an onward transfer, we have responsibility for the processing of personal data we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party acting on our behalf. We shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if this third party processes such personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the alleged damage. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles in each of the Privacy Shield Frameworks.
