</span><p>  As further described below, under this Policy we may collect or derive the following categories of information (which may be considered personal information or sensitive personal information under certain laws):</p><ul>  <li>personal and online identifiers,</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity,</li><li>general geolocation information (inferred from IP address), or precise geolocation information,</li><li>inferences drawn from information listed in this Policy about your predicted characteristics and preferences, and</li><li>other information about you that is linked to personal information.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We may collect information about you or your household from third parties as well. For details about our practices, please read this entire Policy.</p></p> <div><span>  What information is collected and why
</span><p>  <strong> Information you provide to ScorecardResearch. </strong></p><p>  We may collect personal information that you choose to provide to us. For example, if you contact us through our Website, we may collect personal identifiers (e.g., your name and contact information) as well as any other information that you voluntarily provide to us in order to respond to your inquiry or verify your identity, where necessary.</p><p>  <strong> Information collected automatically when you visit our Website. </strong></p></div> <p><p>  Our Website automatically creates logs regarding your activity on our Website. These logs may identify the features that you use, the actions that you take, and the information that you access while on our Website.</p></p> <p><p>  The personal information collected from you may include online identifiers (e.g., IP address) and Internet or other electronic network activity including information about your browsing history, operating system, browser type, website preferences, your use of our Website (e.g., time accessed, duration of visit, etc.). We generally use this information in statistical and aggregate formats to assess the effectiveness of our Website and to better understand your priorities and interests.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Information collected using ScorecardResearch cookies or similar technologies ("Tags"). </strong></p></p> <div><p>  ScorecardResearch Tags collect the following information:</p><ul>  <li>online identifiers (e.g., cookie identifiers, other hardware or device identifiers, and IP addresses),</li><li>geolocation inferred from the IP address, and</li><li>Internet or other electronic network activity including information about your browsing history, operating system, browser type, website preferences, your use of website or application (e.g., time accessed, duration of visit, etc.).</li></ul><p>  The information collected may be processed by us to draw inferences about your predicted characteristics and preferences.</p></div> <p><p>  ScorecardResearch Tags are used by participating websites and applications, including applications on gaming devices, over-the-top devices; and applications that enable users to stream video or perform other functions (collectively “Publishers”) to collect information about your use of those services. Examples of information we collect include the content that you view on the websites you visit, the applications you use, and the advertisements that are served to you through these websites and applications.</p></p> <p><p>  Publishers use the ScorecardResearch Tags by deploying the tags on their websites, in the advertisements served on their websites or other websites or incorporating similar technology into their applications. These ScorecardResearch Tags send a message to the ScorecardResearch service that causes a ScorecardResearch cookie to be set or an online identifier to be collected along with information related to the usage of the services provided by the Publisher.</p></p> <p><p>  For example, if you visit a site that uses ScorecardResearch Tags, the tag will set a cookie on your browser which enables ScorecardResearch to receive a cookie identifier and the website usage information. Comscore, on behalf of ScorecardResearch, combines that information with information from other Publishers and may provide reporting about the demographic composition of the website, unique visitors, or reach of a particular ad campaign.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Other information collected by third parties. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  In addition to collecting information directly, we may also collect categories of personal information listed <a href="#sec0" target="_blank"> above </a> about you from third parties and service providers and combine that data with other data that we collect from or about you.</p></p> <p><p>  These third parties include the following categories of sources, for example: website and application operators, social media platforms, consumer preference reporting companies, credit reporting agencies, information resellers, search engines, email/Internet service providers, television and mobile communication service providers, advertising networks, data analytics providers, and affiliates not under the Comscore brand.</p></p> <p><p>  For a list of some of our specific partners please click <a href="https://www.comscore.com/About/Privacy/Partners" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Third parties may set a cookie on your computer or device when you visit a participating website, use a participating application, or view an advertisement on participating websites or in participating applications. It may also involve a third party collecting online identifiers associated with your device (e.g., cookie identifiers, other hardware or device identifiers, and IP addresses).</p></p> <p><p>  We may associate any information obtained from the categories of third parties listed above with information collected by third-party cookies on your computer or device, or any other information we have collected from or about you, using confidential matching procedures. The information that we obtain from other sources may include information about your:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>online web browsing activities and advertising exposure,</li><li>television viewing behavior (such as programs that you watch and record, your usage of your set-top box, your consumption of on-demand programming and over-the-top content, and your usage of interactive television applications)</li><li>interests, and</li><li>usage of applications, social media platforms, and your usage of your device(s).</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We use the information that we collect directly from you, through your use of our Website, through ScorecardResearch Tags, and from third parties to operate and improve our business including to produce reports, research and information products that we share with clients. These reports help our clients meet their business goals by providing them with a better understanding of digital consumption behavior, trends and consumer preferences. The information we collect about your Web browsing and your usage of applications may be collected over time and across digital properties, and we may process that information to create possible relationships among different browsers and devices.

</span><p>  <strong> What is interest-based advertising? </strong></p></div> <p><p>  Interest-based advertising, also known as online behavioral advertising or targeted advertising, allows advertisers to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.</p></p> <p><p>  We may use third parties and service providers, as discussed in the <a href="#sec1" target="_blank"> What information is collected and why </a> section, to collect information for interest-based advertising. This process may involve third parties and services providers using tagging technology, such as a cookie, on your device. These tags may collect data about your Web browsing over time and across digital properties, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices. We adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Principles in connection to all interest-based advertising activities.</p></p> <p><p>  The information collected from ScorecardResearch Tags is used for interest-based advertising purposes, where appropriate. ScorecardResearch does not use information collected in the European Union (“EU”) for interest-based advertising services.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> How do I manage my preferences for interest-based advertising? </strong></p><p>  You may visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank"> www.aboutads.info/choices </a> to learn more about interest-based advertising, to opt out of our collection and transfer of Web browsing information for interest-based advertising purposes, and to opt out of the collection and use of information for this purpose by other companies that participate in industry self-regulation. Additionally, to opt out of our collection and transfer of application usage information for third parties to use for their own interest-based advertising purposes, you can use any controls that are provided for this purpose by the operating system on your mobile device. Please note that opting out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or in the applications you use. It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests. You may also continue to receive interest-based advertising from other companies.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> What is market research? </strong></p><p>  Market research is an organized effort to gather information about markets and customers. With the use of ScorecardResearch Tags and surveys, Comscore’s market research group collects and analyzes information to provide products and services to companies around the world. This information helps companies better understand and meet the needs of consumers.</p><p>  <strong> How do I manage my preferences for market research? </strong></p><p>  To control your level of participation in our market research programs or opt out, click <a href="http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx" target="_blank"> here </a>. By opting out of our market research program, ScorecardResearch Tags will only be able to count your visit to a particular site but not identify your device beyond that count. Additionally, if your mobile device platform offers settings to limit data collection for interest-based advertising, you can use these settings to opt out of participating in our market research programs.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> What does opting out of market research on your browser do? </strong></p><p>  The browser opt-out mechanisms linked above are cookie based (i.e., a cookie must be on your computer to tell our systems that you have opted out). The cookie-based method does not prevent us from identifying certain events (e.g., when a user visits a website). The method, however, prevents us from associating that event with your browser or otherwise identifying you beyond us merely counting your visit. If you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, this opt-out may not be effective. Additionally, because different computers and different Internet browsers require their own version of the opt-out cookie, you may need to perform this opt-out process on any computers and browsers that you want to be opted-out.</p></div> <div><span>  Other important information about your personal information
</span><p>  <strong> Security. </strong> We use organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your personal information.

Subject to the next paragraph below, please be aware that the United States, and other countries in which your data may be maintained, may have data protection laws that are different from the laws in your country.</p></div> <p><p>  We take measures to help protect your personal information when it is transferred from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom to other countries. We may rely on European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable (see <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target="_blank"> here </a>). Where applicable, we rely on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission (see <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank"> here </a>) in our contracts with third parties that receive information outside the EEA and United Kingdom, or we transfer information on the basis of permissible statutory derogations.</p></p> <p><p>  For individuals based in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland, Comscore B.V., Herikerbergweg 280, 1101 CT Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is the controller for personal data collected and processed from website visitors and application users, unless otherwise stated in an application-specific privacy policy.
