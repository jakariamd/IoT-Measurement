<div><h1>  <b> Privacy Policy </b></h1><p>  <em> Updated June 14, 2022 </em></p><p>  Hydreon Corporation, owner of the Lifeboat Network, takes your privacy very seriously. We live by the Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” We want our private information kept private, therefore, we promise to keep your information private and used only for it’s intended purpose.</p></div> <div><h5>  <strong> SECTION 1 – Introduction </strong></h5><p>  The purpose of this privacy policy is to explain the type of information we collect or receive and how we use it. When you use our games, access our website and other services, or make a purchase, you agree to our use of your data as laid out in this privacy policy.</p></div> <div><h5>  <strong> SECTION 2 – What personal data we collect, or receive, and why we collect it </strong></h5><p>  We collect, store, and use your personal information only when necessary. All personal information is kept for only as long as it is necessary to provide the services you use or request. The following are places where we may collect your information.</p><p>  <em> IN-GAME </em>
Since all registration, sign in, and purchases are done with your Xbox network account, we store a very limited amount of information. For privacy information relating to the Minecraft Game, MineCoins, and Xbox network please refer to the <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank"> Microsoft Privacy Policy </a>.</p></div> <p><p>  When you play on our servers, we collect your Xbox network username, Lifeboat username(if there is one available), rank, and purchases made.</p></p> <p><p>  When you make a purchase on the Lifeboat Store in the Minecraft App using Minecoins, we are given your username via Microsoft so we may add the appropriate purchase.</p></p> <p><p>  If you previously registered an account on our server network prior to Xbox network usage, the only personal information that was required and collected was your username and email address. We have since removed all email addresses from our database, therefore, the only information still retained is your username. Due to this, we are unable to delete accounts as we have no way of verifying account ownership. We periodically remove inactive accounts, so the account will eventually be deleted. Rest assured, there is no other personally identifiable information retained.</p></p> <p><p>  <em> WEBSITE </em>

We use this information to bill the credit card, ship the item to the address given, and keep you updated on the status of the order.</p></p> <p><p>  If you enter and win a contest for a physical item we collect the personal information you give us such as your username, name, physical address, and email address. We use this information to ship the item to the address you provide and keep you updated on the status of the order.</p></p> <p><p>  When you browse our website, we automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address to help us learn about your browser and operating system.

This is includes <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank"> Microsoft </a>, <a href="https://www.ultracart.com/legal/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank"> Ultracart </a> (our shopping cart software for physical purchases), and <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/" target="_blank"> Quickbooks Merchant Services </a> (our credit card payment processor).</p></div> <p><p>  For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So, if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider, or its facilities, are located.</p></p> <p><p>  Once you leave our website, or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy, though the information we have retained from you is still subject to this policy.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Cookies </strong></p><p>  By using this website and having cookies enabled in your browser settings, you are accepting our privacy policy and cookies.
