</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>to help us personalise the services and communications you receive (including programme and other recommendations and tailored advertising), which means that, in turn, (i) we are able to maximise the revenue that we generate from advertising to help us to cover the costs of the free services which we provide to you and (ii) bring you relevant adverts on third party services. Personalisation is automated and may be based on various factors such as your age, postcode or gender, your device details or your inferred interests (which may come from the programmes you watch, preferred channels or time of viewing or other information which we learn about you from other sources). We will enable our advertising partners to display more tailored advertising to you. By interacting with, or viewing, an advert, you should be aware that that third party may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advert. 
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  (iii) <strong> Consent: </strong> We will ask you for your consent to collect or process your personal information on certain occasions, in particular:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>In order to send you information about the latest UKTV news, and / or the digital products and services offered by UKTV.
