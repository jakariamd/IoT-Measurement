</li><li><strong> SessionID </strong>: Helps to authenticate you when you sign into your account.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Certain third parties may also set cookies on your computer or device when you visit our Sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired a third party to provide services on our behalf, such as payment processing for credit card billing. In other cases, it is because our web pages may contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content, or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third-parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties set and read their cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.

Where personal data originating in Europe is (i) directly transferred to Mixpanel by its customers, (ii) transferred by Mixpanel on an intragroup basis between Mixpanel group entities, or (iii) transferred by Mixpanel to external (sub-)processors, Mixpanel enters into Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) with such parties. Additionally, Mixpanel has in place technical and organizational safeguards to comply with its legal obligations to protect personal data.</p></div> <p><p>  In the future, Mixpanel may rely on alternative transfer tools, but only to the extent such transfer tools are recognized as providing appropriate safeguards necessary to meet the requirements of applicable data protections laws.</p></p> <p><p>  Nonetheless, Mixpanel continues to participate in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework for its collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.

If third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield Framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. Mixpanel complies with the Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p></p> <p><p>  With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to each Privacy Shield Framework, Mixpanel is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
