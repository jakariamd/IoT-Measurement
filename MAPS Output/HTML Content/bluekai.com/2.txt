This new offering delivers privacy-friendly targeting segments based on the evolving content consumption patterns of people-based cohorts. Oracle’s best-in-class <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cx/advertising/contextual-intelligence/" target="_blank"> Contextual Intelligence </a> engine analyzes what a given audience views online to build a profile of the content types they’re most likely to engage with and what they tend to steer away from. The result is a powerful combination, leveraging cohort insights from audience data to find your target customer across a broad array of content.</p></p> <p><p>  Leveraging Oracle’s sophisticated deep learning algorithms and statistical semantic natural language processing, the segments place your ads in front of buyers meeting specific behaviors or a range of demographic attributes based on audience data without the need for identity for ad delivery.</p></p> <div><h2>  An example of Content Affinity Targeting in practice</h2><p>  Let us imagine we’re a bicycle brand looking to drive awareness for our new model road bike .</p><p>  <b> Step 1:  </b>Oracle calls upon itscomprehensive list of proprietary audiences or those from participating. branded data providers, to form the foundational cohort insights. These audiences are grouped into behavioral, buyer or demographic cohorts. In this case we’re looking at the group; cycling enthusiasts</p><p>  <b> Step 2:  </b>We collect the content ingestion patterns of this cohort and disconnect the identity people-based seed from the specific content consumption.We analyse the online content consumed by this audience and compare with the ‘average’ content consumption of a broader audience – this exposes the highly correlated and specific pages for our ideal cohort. For our cycling enthusiasts , these pages could include topics such as green economics and luxury short-haul travel – these would be just two of a multitude of corelated themes.  </p></div> <p><p>  <b> Step 3:  </b>Now that we have our highly correlated pages (and topics), we utilize deep learning algorithms to identify additional content aligned to our cycling enthusiasts , creating a Content Affinity Targeting segment that finds potential customers wherever they might be.</p></p> <p><p>  These segments, just like human behavior, will evolve and this why we re-map and recreate these segments every single day to ensure they are continually changing with audience content consumption.</p></p> <p><p>  Content Affinity segment are available today across both MediaMath and TheTradeDesk where they can be activated immediately.
