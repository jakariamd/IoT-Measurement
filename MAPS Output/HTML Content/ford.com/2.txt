See the <a href="#connectedvehicleprivacynotice" target="_blank"> Connected Vehicle Privacy </a> section below for details and data category definitions.</p></div> <p><p>  In limited situations, we may collect <strong> Vehicle Location </strong>, regardless of location settings.

 </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We may combine personal information we collect from any of the above sources.</p></p> <div><p>  <u> COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES </u></p><p>  Our websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.</p></div> <p><p>  Cookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, help authenticate your Ford account and enable you to sign in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  Our websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.</p></p> <p><p>  Our websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party vendors. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.</p></p> <p><p>  For example, our online Products use third-party tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity.</p></p> <p><p>  You can find out how Google Analytics uses data <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank"> here </a> and how to opt out of Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank"> here </a>.

We may also disclose such information we have collected to Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford Products, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) websites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or “online behavioral advertising”.</p></div> <p><p>  You can opt out of certain cookies and other technologies by clicking on the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our websites. You can also learn more by visiting our <a href="/help/privacy/ccpa.html" target="_blank"> Your Privacy Choices Page </a> and the additional information below.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Industry-wide opt-outs </u>. Many advertising and analytics providers are members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Mobile advertising ID controls </u>. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Browser controls </u>. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Do Not Track </u>. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Email web beacons </u>. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op controls </u>. Ford participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This Co-op allows Adobe to better understand how websites and apps are used by linking various devices that appear to be used by the same person. In turn, it helps companies who are members of the Co-op, including Ford, create websites, apps and ads customized for you, across all your devices. You can learn more about the Co-op, how it works, and how to opt-out <a href="https://cross-device-privacy.adobe.com/" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <div><p>  <u> OUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </u></p><p>  We use the personal information we collect for purposes described in this Notice or otherwise disclosed to you.

In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different sources to give you a more seamless, consistent, personalized, and relevant experience.

The modem allows the vehicle to connect to wireless networks, much like a mobile device with a subscriber identity module (SIM). Like other vehicle parts, the modem is installed at the factory.</li></ul><p>                      - Periodically, the modem sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider to enable Connected Services. The messages could include information that identifies the vehicle, the SIM, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect modem. At delivery, select model year 2020 and later vehicles are sharing <strong> Vehicle Data </strong> with us (e.g., diagnostics).</p></div> <p><p>                      - The cellular network provider may also associate the modem’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the modem is deactivated, the modem will communicate with the cellular network provider.</p></p> <p><p>                      - You may be able to customize your preferences in the in-vehicle connectivity settings menu. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information. When connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app), you may be able to access additional features.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li><strong> Ford Connectivity Devices (if equipped) </strong>:</li></ul><p>                      - Connectivity Devices (either installed in the vehicle at the factory, installed in the vehicle by a dealer, or plugged into the OBD port in compatible vehicles) enable access to Connectivity Services. Connectivity Devices allow connected vehicles to connect to a wireless network (much like a mobile device with a SIM).</p><p>                      - Periodically, the Connectivity Device sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider. These messages contain a unique number which identifies the Connectivity Device’s SIM, the vehicle's VIN, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the Connectivity Device.</p></div> <p><p>                      - The cellular network provider may also associate the Connectivity Device’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the Connectivity Device is deactivated, the Connectivity Device will communicate with the cellular network provider. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information.</p></p> <p><p>                      - When connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app), you may be able to access additional features. Some features require an active FordPass / Lincoln Way account.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Wi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped) </strong>: Certain vehicles equipped with FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect can sign-up with AT&T for Wi-Fi Hotspot service in the vehicle. To enable the activation of the Wi-Fi Hotspot, certain information, including the vehicle's VIN and the SIM identifier, is provided to AT&T, who manages the subscription and will use that information according to its own privacy notice, which you can find <a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"> here </a>. AT&T will inform us when certain data usage thresholds are met. If you have paired FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect to the FordPass or Lincoln Way app, you can view approximate data plan usage amounts within the app and in your vehicle. For more information about the vehicle Wi-Fi hotspot, please visit the following websites:</li></ul></ul> <p><p>                      - <a href="https://www.ford.com/support/category/fordpass/fordpass-connect-wifi-hotspot/" target="_blank"> Ford Vehicles </a></p></p> <p><p>                      - <a href="https://owner.lincoln.com/tools/account/lincoln-connect-with-wifi-hotspot.html" target="_blank"> Lincoln Vehicles </a></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Note </strong>: If you’re planning to sell your Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, remember to remove the vehicle from your AT&T account before you sell the vehicle. And, if you purchase or lease a used Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, you’ll need to contact AT&T to add the new vehicle to your AT&T account.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> SYNC Wi-Fi (if equipped) </strong>: To enhance the SYNC experience, when connected to Wi-Fi (data charges may apply), Vehicle Analytics is shared with us and we periodically release software updates so the vehicle has the latest compatible SYNC version. You can choose to enable Share Media Analytics, Send Failed Voice Commands, and/or Submit Feedback regarding SYNC in the in-vehicle settings menu.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Note:  </strong>Please make sure you connect the vehicle to trusted Wi-Fi networks.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> AppLink (if equipped) </strong>: You may be able to use AppLink, to connect your mobile apps with SYNC 3/SYNC 4 (SYNC). Your mobile device provides the data connection (so data charges may apply) and SYNC provides the infotainment integration, including voice controls.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>                      - To enable mobile apps, SYNC requires user consent to send and receive app authorization information and updates, using the data plan associated with the connected device. The connected device sends encrypted data (such as the VIN, SYNC module serial number or other component identifier, odometer, enabled apps, usage statistics and debugging information) to us. SYNC organizes app permissions into groups. When not driving, you may be able to use the settings menu to grant these group permissions individually, change a permission group status, and see the data included in each group, if equipped. When you launch an app using SYNC, the system may ask you to grant certain permissions, for example, information about the vehicle, such as Vehicle Data, Driving Data, Vehicle Location, Convenience Controls, and/or Push Notifications. Please be aware that the permission selections available to you may vary based on which version of SYNC is equipped in your vehicle. You can enable all groups or none of them during the initial app permissions prompts. Please see the owner’s manual for more information. Please note that you are only prompted to grant permissions the first time you use an app with SYNC. We recommend you review the terms and conditions and privacy notices for any third-party app or service to which you subscribe and/or use. We take no responsibility for apps or services provided by any third party, including their use of any data. If you choose to share information about your vehicle through your use of third-party apps or services, once you have shared the information, the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy notices (and not this Notice) apply to the shared information.</p></p> <p><p>  If you change your mind about sharing vehicle information with a mobile app or want to stop using it with SYNC, you can change your preferences in SYNC’s Mobile App settings in the vehicle.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> 911 Assist (if equipped) </strong>: 911 Assist (if equipped and active) may, through any paired and connected cellular phone, disclose to emergency services that the vehicle has been in a crash involving the deployment of an airbag or, in certain vehicles, the activation of the fuel pump shut-off. Certain versions or updates to 911 Assist may also be capable of being used to electronically or verbally provide the vehicle location (such as latitude and longitude) and/or other details about the vehicle or crash, change in velocity, and possible detection of fastened seatbelts, or personal information about the occupants to 911 operators to assist them in providing the most appropriate emergency services. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not activate the 911 Assist feature. If any user sets 911 Assist to on or off, that setting applies for all paired phones. To switch 911 Assist on and off or for more information, please see your owner’s manual (SYNC and Settings).</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Note:  </strong>Vehicles equipped with the MyKey feature may be capable of overriding the 911 Assist settings and turning 911 Assist On, even if it was previously set to Off. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not enable MyKey.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location and Global Positioning System (GPS) (if equipped) </strong>: Some vehicles contain global positioning system (GPS) capability or, in some instances, may utilize the GPS in connected wireless devices. GPS may be used to determine the vehicle’s physical location, travel direction, and speed, and to record this information over time to provide location-based services.</li><li><strong> Ford Apps </strong>: If a vehicle is equipped with connectivity technology, you may be able to connect to the vehicle using the FordPass/Lincoln Way apps. If you associate a vehicle to your FordPass/Lincoln Way account, the vehicle may send Connected Vehicle Information, including location information, to us. To turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass/Lincoln Way account, you must perform a <strong> MASTER RESET </strong> on the vehicle or remove the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. Deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing.

</span><p>  If a FordPass / Lincoln Way account has been associated with the vehicle, this icon indicates that Vehicle Data and/or Driving Data are being shared (based on your sharing settings).
</p></div> <p><p>  These icons may be hidden temporarily while you navigate in menus or use certain features and services (such as Android Auto or Apple CarPlay).</p></p> <p><p>  You may be able to check the status bar on the screen of the in-vehicle infotainment system, if equipped, for alerts and notifications, including strength of nearby Wi-Fi networks or the strength of the connection coming from your mobile device.</p></p> <p><p>  Vehicles equipped with Connectivity Devices include a window etching (or sticker) with an image similar to below, indicating the Connectivity Device may be sharing Connected Vehicle Information, for example vehicle data and location.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Note </strong>: To stop the Connectivity Device from sharing this information, see your Connectivity Settings through the FordPass / Lincoln Way app. You may also remove the vehicle from your FordPass / Lincoln Way account.</p></p> <p><p>  For other vehicle models, please see the owner’s manual, check the in-vehicle settings (if equipped) or contact your dealer for more information about what connectivity equipment is installed in the vehicle, and how to tell if the vehicle is sharing data. You can also find out how to deactivate vehicle connectivity in the owner’s manual.</p></p> <div><p>  <u> Sharing a Vehicle or Driving a Shared Vehicle </u></p><p>  If you share a vehicle with others, please tell them about the connectivity and privacy settings for the vehicle. For example, inform passengers within the vehicle and other drivers of the vehicle that Connected Vehicle Information is being shared with us and our vendors. And, let them know where they can find the information needed to connect to the vehicle's Wi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped and activated) and where they can turn off vehicle location and other connected vehicle data sharing settings, if equipped.</p></div> <p><p>  Multiple accounts can be created on the FordPass / Lincoln Way apps, and more than one account can be connected to a single vehicle. If you drive a vehicle with more than one account connected to it, the user(s) of each account will have access to:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The vehicle's location;</li><li>Services that allow the vehicle to be remotely started, locked and unlocked; and</li><li>Services that show information about the vehicle's status (for example, its fuel level).</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Similarly, if you drive a vehicle with the FordPass / Lincoln Way app connected to it, the user(s) of the app will have access to the information and services outlined above.</p></p> <p><p>  If you want to connect an account on the FordPass / Lincoln Way app to a vehicle that has already been connected to another account, your name and the fact that you have requested this connection will be shared, via the FordPass / Lincoln Way app, with current user(s) who connected to the vehicle before you. The current user or users have the opportunity to allow or refuse your connection to the vehicle.</p></p> <p><p>  Additionally, you can turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass / Lincoln Way account by performing a <strong> MASTER RESET </strong> or by removing the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. To learn how to perform a <strong> MASTER RESET </strong>, please see your owner’s manual. <strong> Simply deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing </strong>. See Connected Vehicle Controls (above) for more information.</p></p> <p><p>  Some vehicles have in-vehicle pop-up notifications to alert drivers and passengers of Connected Vehicle Information sharing settings (see “How to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data” above). Drivers with an unrecognized mobile device may see a pop-up displayed in-vehicle informing them of the current vehicle data and/or location sharing settings. A mobile device is “recognized” if it has been paired with an infotainment system, like SYNC. This way if someone is new to the vehicle, or not driving it enough to pair their mobile device, the system will inform them of the vehicle’s current data and/or location sharing settings.</p></p> <div><h2>  California Privacy Disclosures</h2><span>  Print</span><p>  <strong> CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND INFORMATION </strong></p><p>  Effective Date: July 1, 2023</p><p>  <strong> California Consumer Privacy Act Policy and Notice at Collection </strong></p><p>  This California Consumer Privacy Act Policy and Notice at Collection (the “California Notice”) describes how we Collect and use Personal Information (“PI”) and the rights that the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (the “CCPA”), provides to California residents.</p></div> <p><p>  To learn more about the Personal Information we collect and how we use it, you can click <a href="#whatinfo" target="_blank"> here </a> to view our Information Practices.
