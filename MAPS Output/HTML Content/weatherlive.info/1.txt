Do Not Track Disclosures</h4><p>  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.

Information for Residents of California: Your California Privacy Rights</h4><p>  If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") may provide you with rights that are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy regarding our use of your personal information. The CCPA Notice applies to "Consumers" as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights. See <a href="#a" target="_blank"> Sections 1 - 4 </a> above to learn what information we collect from you and how it is collected, used and shared.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Access to Information and Data Portability Rights </strong></p><p>  You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:</p><ul>  <li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</li><li>The categories of sources from which we collected your personal information.</li><li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your personal information.</li><li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.</li><li>The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li><li>A list of the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>A list of the categories of personal information sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred.  If we sold your personal information, we will explain:
                    • The categories of your personal information we have sold.
                    • The categories of third parties to which we sold personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third party.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Data Deletion Rights </strong></p><p>  Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.  Note also that we are not required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.</p><p>  <strong> Exercising Your Rights </strong></p><p>  To make a request for access, portability or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/982b0a23-3053-4df0-9089-7ce3acd59c8d/517a4e08-5f18-4429-a4b9-f0d90dde4045.html" target="_blank"> here </a> or mail your request for the attention of the Privacy / Legal Department to Apalon, LLC., 555 West 18th Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10011. California Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process ("Verifiable Consumer Request").</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> The Verifiable Consumer Request must: </strong></p><ul>  <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</li><li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li></ul><p>  Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests. If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.</p></div> <p><p>  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.  We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Opt-Out </strong></p><p>  There is not yet a consensus as to whether third party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites and mobile apps may constitute a "sale" of your PI as defined by the CCPA. To make a request to opt-out of sale under CCPA, click <a href="https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/982b0a23-3053-4df0-9089-7ce3acd59c8d/41a5ae49-ae43-45d0-9073-7802f4c33f4f" target="_blank"> here </a>. See <a href="#i" target="_blank"> Section 9 </a>: Online Privacy Choices and Rights to learn how you can exercise your rights regarding interest-based advertising.</p></div> <p><p>  We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.  However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.   In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale and retention and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.  The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.  We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.</p></p> <p><p>  California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if we share Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes you will be able to elect for us not to do so by submitting your request <a href="mailto:support@Apalon.com" target="_blank"> here </a> (please include your name, mailing address, and email address).</p></p> <p><p>  To find out more about our "do not track" practices under Cal.

The legal basis for collecting and using the information depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it. During your use of some features, we will collect your personal information after obtaining your consent. Unless the provision of such information is required by applicable laws and regulations, refusing to provide such information will only result in your inability to use the related features, and will not affect your use of other features.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Sensitive Personal Information </strong></p><p>  Access to sensitive personal information, such as contacts, exact location, camera, microphone and album, is disabled by default, and will only be enabled upon your express authorization. It is important to note that obtaining your authorization to access sensitive personal information is a necessary but not sufficient condition for us to collect certain information. Our acquisition of your authorization to access sensitive personal information does not mean that we will definitely collect your relevant information. We will only collect your sensitive personal information when there is a specified purpose and sufficient necessity and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For the collection and processing of sensitive personal information, specific consent shall be obtained from you.</p></div> <p><p>  We place great value on the protection of minors’ personal information. As required by applicable laws and regulations, any user under the age of 14 shall obtain the written consent of his/her parent or statutory guardian prior to providing sensitive personal information to us.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Information Shared with a Third Party </strong></p><p>  We will share your personal information with third parties only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unless explicitly authorized by you, we will not share any information that can be used to identify your identity (such as your name or email address).

We will direct all such third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and not to use your information for any purpose other than that have been authorized by you.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Data Retention </strong></p><p>  We may retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. We may retain personal information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, which includes retention that may be required for regulatory purposes. </p><p>  If we discontinue providing our Services, we will notify you of such change by sending a notification, posting an announcement, or other means, and delete or anonymize your sensitive personal information within a reasonable period. “Anonymization” refers to the irreversible erasure or removal of sensitive personal information that leads to the information owner being identified. Any anonymized information shall not be considered as personal information. </p></div> <p><p>  Your personal information collected from Mainland China will be stored in a location within Mainland China in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If it is necessary to change the location where your personal information is stored from Mainland China to another location outside Mainland China, the information transfer will be conducted in strict compliance with applicable laws.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Right to Delete Information </strong></p><p>  We will delete, and you have the right to request the deletion of, your personal information if:</p><ul>  <li>the purpose of processing such personal information has been achieved or is unable to be achieved, or the personal information is no longer necessary for achieving such purpose;</li><li>we cease the provision of the Service, or the required information retention period has expired;</li><li>relevant authorization or consent is withdrawn by you;</li><li>the processing of personal information by us is in violation of any applicable law, regulations or agreement; or</li><li>any other circumstances as provided by applicable laws or regulations.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  If the information retention period prescribed by law has not expired, or it is technically difficult to delete the personal information, we will cease the processing of such personal information, except for storage and any necessary measure taken for security protection purpose.</p></p> <div><h4>  10.

By using our services and providing personal information, you consent to such transfer, storage and processing.

Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, including use of Cross-device Data for serving ads, visit <u> http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ </u>, and <u> http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices </u> for information on the DAA's opt-out program specifically for mobile apps (including use of precise location for third party ads). Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <u> http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ </u>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.  Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
