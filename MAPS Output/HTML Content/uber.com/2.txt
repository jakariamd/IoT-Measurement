This includes encryption and the use of pseudonymized data to help protect users' full identity against unauthorized disclosure.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For your convenience, the exercise of your data protection rights can be directed to Uber via any of the designated channels mentioned above, and will be handled centrally on behalf of the relevant controller. Questions, comments, and complaints about Uber’s data practices can be submitted <u> here </u>.

This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber’s behalf.</li><li><strong> Identity verification photos:  </strong>This includes photos of users (such as, selfies) and/or their government issued identifications (such as, driver’s license or passports). Such photos may be used to verify a user’s identity, such as through facial verification technologies. Please see the section titled “<strong> How we use personal data </strong>” for more information regarding how user photos are used for safety and security purposes, including identity verification.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Demographic data:  </strong>We may collect demographic data about users, such as birth date/age, gender or occupation, when required for certain Uber services or programs, such as Uber Cash, alcohol deliveries or safety features that allow women users to set a preference to provide or receive services to/from other women (“Women Rider Preference”). We may also collect demographic data, such as age group and household composition, through user surveys, and use this information to offer Uber products and services that are likely to be of interest to you. We may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, we may infer a user’s gender based on their first name to enable safety features, such as the Women Rider Preference, or to display personalized ads for third party products or services. See the section titled “<strong> How we use personal data </strong>” below for more information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> User content: </strong> We collect the data submitted by users when they contact Uber customer support (including at Uber Greenlight Hubs or via phone chat or video conferencing tools), provide ratings or feedback for other users, restaurants or merchants, or otherwise contact Uber. This may include photographs, or audio or video recordings submitted by users in connection with a customer support request. This also includes metadata relating to the method you use to communicate with Uber. The contents of photos and recordings submitted by users are subject to <u> Uber’s Community Guidelines </u> (except that such guidelines do not apply to users in Switzerland and Belgium).In certain jurisdictions, users can record the audio and/or video of their trips through an in-app feature or using a dashcam. In app recordings are encrypted and stored on users’ devices, and are only shared with Uber if submitted by the users in connection with safety incidents. Please see <u> here </u> for more information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Travel information:  </strong>We collect travel itinerary information, including times and dates of upcoming flight, lodging or car rental reservations, from users of our <u> Uber Travel </u> feature. We collect such information: (i) when users manually input their information into their Uber Travel itinerary; or (2) if authorized by users to access their email account, from travel-related email confirmations. If so authorized, Uber will only access users’ email accounts to collect travel itinerary information to enable the Uber Travel feature, and will adhere to the applicable email provider policies, including <u> Google’s API Services User Data Policy </u>,  which impose certain limitations on the use of data collected from users’ email accounts. Users may remove Uber’s access to their email accounts at any time either in-app or through their email service provider settings. Detailed information on how to remove email account access is available <u> here </u>.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong>  2.  Data created during use of our services.  </strong>This includes: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location data (driver and delivery person): </strong> We collect precise or approximate location data from drivers’ and delivery persons’ mobile devices when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen).</li><li><strong> Location data (riders and order recipients) </strong>. We collect precise or approximate location information from riders’ and order recipients’ mobile devices if they enable us to do so via their device settings. Uber collects such data from the time a ride or order is requested until it is finished, and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen). See “<strong> Choice and transparency </strong>” below for information on how riders and order recipients can enable precise location data collection. Riders and order recipients may use the Uber apps without enabling collection of location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect certain features in the Uber apps. For example, a rider who has not enabled precise location data will have to manually enter their pickup address.In addition, precise location data collected from a driver’s device during a trip is linked to the rider’s account, even if the rider has not enabled precise location data to be collected from their device. This data is used for purposes such as receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Transaction information:  </strong>We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided; trip or order details (such as date and time, requested pick-up and drop off addresses, distance traveled and items ordered); and payment transaction information (such as a restaurant’s or merchant's name and location, amount charged, and payment method). We also associate a user’s name with that of anyone who uses their promotion code.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Usage data: </strong> We collect data about how users interact with our services.

This includes:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>verifying users' identity and eligibility to provide transportation or deliveries, including through reviews of background checks, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe drivers and/or riders.In certain regions, this includes Uber’s <u> Real-Time ID Check </u> feature, which prompts drivers and delivery persons to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the driver or delivery person using the app matches the Uber account we have on file. We may also use this feature for other verification purposes such as verifying change of bank account information or regaining account access.In addition, we may use facial recognition technology to process user profile photographs, identification photographs, or other user-submitted photographs to prevent identity-borrowing or use of our services by unauthorized drivers or delivery people.We may also use selfies to verify that users are wearing masks, helmets or other safety gear through the use of object verification technology.In some countries, riders may be required to verify their identity to use cash and certain other payment methods. In such cases, Uber allows riders to provide their ID number and/or a photo of their identification card to complete such verifications. Please see <u> here </u> for more information about rider identity verification.Similarly, order recipients may be required to provide their age and an image of their government issued identification to verify their eligibility to order and receive alcohol deliveries. Please see <u> here </u> for more information about order recipient identity verification.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>using data from drivers’ or delivery persons’ devices to detect unsafe driving behavior such as speeding or harsh braking and acceleration, and to inform them of safer driving practices. We also use data from delivery persons’ devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries.</li><li>using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee.
