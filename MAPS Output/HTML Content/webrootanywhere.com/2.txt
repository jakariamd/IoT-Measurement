Your employer, as a customer or partner of OpenText, may provide your contact information as required to provide OpenText products or services. We also collect personal information where you or your employer is a customer of a business we may acquire.

For more information, refer to our <a href="/about/cookie-policy" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Do Not Track (DNT) </strong>: Your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to websites and online services that you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what DNT means in this context, and some browsers automatically apply DNT signals by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors' choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests. As a result, like many websites, we do not respond to a DNT signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about DNT, please visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank"> http://allaboutdnt.com </a>. However, you may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web browser or opting out of the OpenText cookies. Please note that if you do not accept certain cookies, you may not be able to use all functions and features of our Website(s). Consent for use of cookies varies depending on the jurisdiction.

For example, OpenText may collect and receive personal information about you from companies that distribute OpenText products by way of co-branded or private-labeled websites. Companies with which OpenText partners to market, resell and distribute its products and services, which may include the payment gateways we work with, also may supply us with personal information in order to help us fulfil orders and provide services. We may also collect your personal information from public sources or from data brokers (for example, LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, Dun & Bradstreet) to the extent the local regulations allow. Personal information collected through such sources may include your name, email address, mailing address, business phone and job title. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Website or other sources.</p></p> <div><h4>  How We Share Your Data</h4><p>  OpenText may share personal information with its affiliates, business partners (including those who resell or distribute our products and services), service providers (including website, software, infrastructure and application providers), payment gateways, customer service, event/campaign management, cloud hosting providers, credit reference agencies, debt agencies, professional advisors, marketing agencies (including event or promotion partners or sponsors), third-party networks and websites, database providers, backup and disaster recovery specialists, analytics and email providers) and agents working on our behalf.</p></div> <p><p>  We may be required to share personal information with a third party or body where such disclosure is required to satisfy applicable law or other legal or regulatory requirement, or to protect the rights or property of OpenText or others. This can include in response to lawful requests from a competent authority or body and to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p></p> <p><p>  If all or any part of our business is re-organized or sold to or there is a joint venture with another organization, we may need to provide your information to that organization. We may also be the recipient of personal information when we acquire another organization or a part of their business or enter into a joint venture with them.</p></p> <p><p>  Where third parties are performing processing on our behalf, OpenText will require these organizations to adopt adequate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal information and to ensure the processing of personal information is only performed as instructed by OpenText and for no other purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  Personal information may be processed outside the country of your residence by our affiliates, partners or service providers and agents working on our behalf. The transfer to other countries by OpenText and its affiliates shall be in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, which may include an adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information and ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p><p>  All our employees are subject to confidentiality agreements and undergo annual training on the proper handling of personal information.</p><p>  OpenText is committed to protect all personal information and is cognizant of its obligations under applicable data protection laws.

If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy notice of any website you visit.</p></p> <div><h4>  How Long We Store Your Data</h4><p>  OpenText will retain personal information for as long as needed to provide the relevant products or services or to fulfil the purposes for which the personal information was collected or as per the specific contractual terms. OpenText may also retain and use this information for a longer period as permitted or required by law, to comply with our legal, tax or regulatory obligations (e.g., audit and accounting requirements), handle disputes, to exercise or defend claims and enforce our agreements. We ensure that personal information we dispose of is de-identified or destroyed in a secure manner.</p></div> <div><h4>  Your Privacy Rights</h4><p>  Your local applicable law may provide certain rights regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. You may request from OpenText access to, correction of, updating of and/or deletion of your personal information, or object to our use of your personal information in certain circumstances, in line with applicable data protection law.

The rights available to you depend on your juridiction and our reason for processing your information:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Your right of access </strong>You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. This right always applies. There are some exemptions, which means you may not always receive all the information we process.</li><li><strong> Your right to rectification </strong>You have the right to ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. This right always applies.</li><li><strong> Your right to erasure </strong>You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Your right to restriction of processing </strong>You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information in certain circumstances.</li><li><strong> Your right to object to processing </strong>You have the right to object to processing if we are able to process your information because the process forms part of our public tasks or is in our legitimate interests.</li><li><strong> Your right to data portability </strong>This only applies to information you have given us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one organization to another or give it to you. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering into a contract and the processing is automated.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If we are processing your information for criminal law enforcement purposes, your rights are slightly different. Please see the relevant section of this notice.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Exercise Your Privacy Rights: </strong> To exercise your privacy rights, please fill out the <a href="https://privacyportal-de.onetrust.com/webform/b22adc29-a371-4aaa-a82b-043f0024fdb4/74f036d5-7b9a-4b4a-a84e-9d3f4b82d565" target="_blank"> Data Subject Request form </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Please direct any complaints or questions you may have with regard to our privacy practices to <a href="#Contact-Information" target="_blank"> OpenText’s Data Protection Officer </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  You may also have the right to complain to the competent supervisory authority.

OpenText does not sell personal information. OpenText may share personal information with third parties or allow them to collect personal information from our Website, products or services in certain situations, such as where they are our authorized service providers or business partners and have a contract with us, where you consent to or direct us to disclose the personal data to those parties, if you use our Websites or services to interact with those third parties or we are otherwise permitted or required to do so by law. We may also share personal information with or allow third parties to collect personal information from our Websites and apps (for example, through the use of cookies or similar technologies) to help us deliver advertising to you and to make it more relevant to you. This activity may be considered a sale under the CCPA. See our Cookie Policy for information on how to manage these.
