It also includes powerful controls to limit viewing, replying and forwarding of emails. In addition, the service can employ legally binding signatures for critical transactions.</p></div> <div><h2>  Why is Email Message Privacy important?</h2><p>  Organizations are increasingly reliant on sharing large files, which are not supported by many email platforms. When companies turn to public cloud sharing, they introduce significant security and compliance risks.</p><p>  Hybrid work coupled with a shift to the cloud have accelerated the reliance on electronic messages. Organizations need granular control and management of these messages – and their content – to maintain security, privacy and compliance.</p></div> <div><h3>  Benefits</h3><p>  Simple integration into existing email and other communication channels</p><p>  Efficiently delivers large files securely, despite email server limitations.</p><p>  Ensures compliance with easy and secure message exchange plus file sharing</p><p>  Purpose built for MSPs and SMBs</p><p>  Intuitive management controls and comprehensive support</p></div> <div><h2>  Features</h2></div> <div><h5>  No infrastructure investment needed</h5></div> <div><h5>  Full mobile functionality support</h5></div> <div><h5>  Integrates with Single Sign-On (SSO) environments</h5></div> <div><h5>  Custom branding available</h5></div> <div><h5>  Only pay for professional users, guest users are free</h5></div> <div><h3>  Resources</h3><p>  Datasheet</p></div> <div><h5>  For MSPs: Email Message Privacy</h5><p>  Datasheet</p></div> <div><h5>  For SMBs: Email Message Privacy</h5></div> <div><h3>  Have one of our experts demonstrate the value of Email Message Privacy for your business.</h3></div> <div><h5>  Request a Demo</h5><label>  First Name</label><label>  Last Name</label><label>  Job Title</label><label>  Company Name</label><label>  Email Address</label><label>  Phone Number</label><label>  Num of Employees</label><label>  Country:</label><p>  385 Interlocken Crescent
