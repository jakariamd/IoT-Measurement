Adding Publishers into the Network</h2></div> <div><h4>  1.1 Adding Publishers into the network</h4><p>  Strict policies are in place to ensure that only high-quality sites are selected for VDX.tv’s network.

VDX.tv’s ad server references this approved list to learn where it is and is not allowed, to serve an impression</li><li>If a non-approved domain calls our ad server for an ad, the ad server rejects the request and will NOT serve that domain an ad</li></ul></div> <div><ul>  <li>This process and proprietary technology prevents publishers from accidentally or intentionally retrafficking our ads to questionable sites</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  1.2 Publisher Code of Conduct Overview</h4><ul>  <li>The VDX.tv <a href="https://exponential.com/documents/publisher-code-of-conduct/" target="_blank"> Publisher Code of Conduct </a> defines types of prohibited content (i.e. pornography, copyright infringement, spam, fraud, pyramid schemes, etc…) and types of prohibited actions (i.e. tag re-trafficking, altering ad creative, pay for clicks/impressions, timed rotations/auto-refresh, etc…)</li><li>Publisher domains are approved at VDX.tv’s discretion (i.e. no publishers with downloadable software, no publishers that may be harmful to the business reputation of VDX.tv)</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  1.3 Inventory acquired through RTB</h4><ul>  <li>We supplement our on-network activity with inventory acquired off-network.</li><li>We typically use TAG-certified (<a href="https://www.tagtoday.net/registry" target="_blank"> https://www.tagtoday.net/registry </a>) exchange partners, where feasible.</li><li>We always run activity via a pre-vetted domain Accept list, unless otherwise agreed with the client.</li><li><a href="https://vdx-staging.webflow.io/company/partnerships" target="_blank"> Our list of partners </a> is available for review, although please note, this is subject to change.</li></ul></div> <div><h4>  1.4 Ads.txt</h4><ul>  <li>We support ads.txt and have done so since its launch in 2017.</li><li>We continue to work with publishers who have an ads.txt file enabled and enter us as an approved seller of their inventory.</li><li>Any inventory acquired through RTB is also ads.txt compliant.</li><li>We are committed to our role in creating a cleaner, more transparent advertising ecosystem for everyone.</li></ul></div> <div><h2>  2. Brand Safety</h2><p>  The following section outlines the various roles that both proprietary and 3rd party technology plays in ensuring delivery to the audience intended by the agency/brand.</p><p>  <strong> 2.1 PageGuard™ </strong></p><p>  PageGuard™ is VDX.tv’s proprietary answer to ensuring that all campaigns are delivered to safe environments. It uses a 3 step processes to provide a comprehensive and proactive solution to prevent the possibility of ads appearing on inappropriate content:</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Site acceptance  </strong>(covered in section 1.1)</li><li><strong> Domain Verification  </strong>(covered in section 1.1)</li><li><strong> Page Level Contextualization: </strong> Pages are scanned daily according to traffic priority. Our proprietary page-level contextualization technology then categorizes these pages, assessing the safety of the content. In the event a page is deemed to be an unsafe brand environment, VDX.tv will not serve an ad.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 2.2 3rd Party Content Verification </strong></p></p> <p><p>  In addition to PageGuard, we can also layer on 3<sup> rd </sup> party verification via one of our <a href="https://vdx-staging.webflow.io/company/partnerships" target="_blank"> integrated partners </a>, or via a vendor of the client’s choice. This works as follows:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>An agency/brand decides they want to run a 3rd party verification tool </li><li>Agency either works directly with the verification provider to create verification specifications OR allows VDX.tv to pick a preferred vendor</li><li>Agency sends the specifications to VDX.tv – specs might include an Accept/Block list, intended or violating website categorizations, violating keywords, intended geo targeting, etc…</li><li>VDX.tv targets the campaign in our ad server per the agency’s specifications</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Campaign is set live after applying the verification code in either the agency’s ad server or VDX.tv’s ad server</li><li>VDX.tv starts to receive reporting from the agency ad server AND the verification tool</li><li>If no violations are seen, continue to run campaign</li><li>If violations are seen, adjust campaign targeting until the violations go below the predetermined threshold or disappear altogether</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> **Due to occasionally inaccurate categorizations by the 3rd party vendors, VDX.tv account managers are trained to vet the site categorization from the vendors against their own personal categorization. If the AM categorization vastly disagrees with the vendor’s categorization engine, the AM may pursue the agency to add the site to a whitelist OR the verification vendor to re-categorize the site. </em></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.3 Take Down Policy </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If violations are seen, we adjust the campaign targeting until the violations go below the predetermined threshold or disappear altogether. Correction of flagged violations will occur within 48 hours, but best endeavors will be made to rectify immediately. The contractual consequences of not responding appropriately to a takedown request in the specified time frame will be subject to the terms of individual IOs.</p></p> <div><h2>  3. Geo Targeting</h2><p>  We utilize the leading databases for effective geo-targeting. Please note that there may be minor discrepancies as a result of different vendors using different databases. </p></div> <div><h2>  4. Malware</h2><p>  VDX.tv uses The Media Trust as its 3rd party malware detection service. </p><p>  4.1 Media Trust Integration</p><p>  We have an API integration with the Media Trust that allows them to programmatically scan our ad tags looking for malware. If malware is detected on a tag, this is immediately flagged for internal review and where necessary, the campaign paused and client notified. </p></div> <div><h2>  5. Fraud</h2><p>  VDX.tv has a number of safeguards in place to help keep our network clean and free of invalid traffic: PageGuard, click fraud algorithms, impression fraud algorithms, and a proprietary ad server that allows us to monitor and adjust accordingly.</p><p>  <strong> 5.1 Impression Fraud </strong></p><p>  We do not serve any campaigns to robotic impressions</p><ul>  <li>For every impression, we compare the user agent with a list of known user agents and if found, we mark the request origination from a robot</li><li>Apart from the above static list, we maintain a count of ads served to a user over a certain amount of time. If that gets too high, we flag the activity as potentially invalid and any subsequent impressions for the remaining browsing session will not be counted. That flag can be removed if the activity returns to normal behavior for a sufficient period of time.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Bots are detected and blocked in the future both by means of built-in logic inside our ad server and offline processes.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 5.2 Click Fraud </strong></p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The ad server first checks the combination of creative id (via the mediadata_id), user_id (the unique id associated with a cookie) and timestamp. If we’ve seen the combination before, disregard the click request (it’s a duplicate). The ad server has a strong algorithm to detect all duplicate clicks and disregard those duplicate requests.</li><li>Next, check the IP address and user agent requesting the click against our list of known robots. If either is found, the click request will not be honored.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>If a user has clicked more than a certain number in a preset amount of time, it will be treated as ROBOT for all subsequent views/clicks</li><li>Bots are detected and blocked in the future both by means of built-in logic inside our ad server and having offline processes.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 5.3 Manual Monitoring </strong></p></p> <div><p>  We look for suspicious patterns in the data that may indicate bots or purchased traffic</p><ul>  <li><em> Pre-launch monitoring: </em> Prior to approval, a domain is manually vetted using a combination of licensed tools and proprietary methodology to help determine the likelihood that the domain engages in nefarious behavior</li><li><em> Post-launch monitoring: </em> After domain approval and traffic starts flowing, pubs are monitored on certain distributions of inventory types, as well as fluctuations of various metrics</li><li><em> Consultative technology monitoring: </em> various services are leveraged as an additional safeguard</li></ul></div> <p><p>  VDX.tv’s dedicated publisher team manually monitors this publisher activity on an ongoing basis. If irregularities are noticed, we will either:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Remove the publisher immediately, OR</li><li>Start a conversation regarding the infraction(s). If the publisher is forthcoming with information, we will entertain a second chance. If not, they will be removed</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  6.

information for any of the following reasons:</p><ul>  <li><em> et seq </em></li></ul><p>  <em> Verifiable Consumer Requests </em></p><p>  The CCPA considers the right to know and the right to delete

about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to

are not required to delete your personal information for any of the following reasons:</p><p>  If we deny your request, we will (unless otherwise prohibited by law):</p><p>  If we are unable to verify

know or a request to delete via an Authorized Agent, your Authorized Agent must provide us with written and signed permission from you to submit the request(s).  “Signed” means that the written attestation, declaration, or permission has either been physically signed or provided electronically per the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, Civil Code section 1633.7 <em> et seq.  </em></p></p> <p><p>  Next, contact us (as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above) so we may verify your identity and confirm that you provided the requesting Authorized Agent permission to submit the request(s).</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Fees </strong></p><p>  We will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive.  If we reasonably determine that the request requires a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and give you a cost estimate in writing before completing your request.</p><p>  <strong> Shine The Light Law </strong></p><p>  Separate from the CCPA, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, as amended, also known as the “Shine The Light” law gives California residents the right to request and obtain what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  We do not disclose your personal information to third parties for such third parties to directly market their services to you.  If you have any questions about our Shine The Light Law practices, please contact us as outlined in Section 7 (Contact Information) above.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Do Not Track </strong></p><p>  California law requires us to tell you how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.  DNT allows users a way to inform websites and services that they do

browsers.</p><p>  <strong> Disclosure of Consumer Requests </strong></p><p>  As required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), <a href="https://vdx.tv/" target="_blank"> VDX.tv </a> handled the following types of consumer requests during the year 2020:</p></div> <p><p>  Note, these are global numbers, not only from California residents.</p></p> <p><p>  In terms of the data we use, “opt-out” is the same as “delete”. “Data Removal” in the table above means that if we receive a request regarding data on one of our partner publisher websites, over which we have no editorial control, we will forward the request to the partner publisher for further action.</p></p> <div><h2>  European Privacy Rights</h2><p>  This Section 10 applies to European Residents only.  A “European
