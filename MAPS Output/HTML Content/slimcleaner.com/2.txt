We do this by providing a clear notice in the form of a cookie banner that tells you what cookies are used for, as well as providing you with useful information about the technologies we use and a link to this policy. You'll need to indicate your acceptance of our use of cookies. On a mobile device this might be by swiping a banner or pressing a button. You are able to opt-out of the use of cookies. For more information, see Cookie Control below.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Using information collected from cookies: </strong> where we want to use the information that cookies and similar technologies collect, we either obtain your consent or we maintain a legitimate interest in doing so.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> What Cookies Do We Use and Why? </strong></p><ul>  <li><strong> Strictly Necessary Cookies and Similar Technologies: </strong> these are vital for the running of our Services. Without the use of these cookies, parts of our Services would not function.</li><li><strong> Analytics Cookies and Similar Technologies: </strong> these collect information about your use of our Services, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our websites. They help us record how you interact with our Services, such as how you navigate around pages and from page to page, identifying improvements we can make to the customer journey. They also help identify any difficulties you have accessing our services, so we can fix any problems. Additionally, these cookies allow us to see overall patterns of usage at an aggregated level.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Functional/Preference Cookies and Similar Technologies: </strong> these cookies collect information about your choices and preferences, and allow us to remember things like language, text size, and location, so we can show you relevant content to where you are. They allow us to customise the services you have accessed. We also use these cookies to provide you with services such as video clips.</li><li><strong> Tracking, Advertising Cookies and Similar Technologies: </strong> we use these types of technologies to provide advertisements that we think may be more relevant to your interests. This can be done by delivering online adverts based on your previous web browsing activity, known as "online behavioural advertising" (“OBA”). Cookies are placed on your browser which will remember the websites you have visited. Adverts based on what you have been looking at are then displayed to you when you visit websites which use the same advertising networks.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We may also use cookies and similar technologies to provide you with adverts based on your location, offers you click on, and other similar interactions with our websites and apps. To help us deliver relevant advertising using cookies, we use Google products including Google Marketing Platform. You can find out more here.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Web Beacons and Tracking Pixels: </strong> these are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website or webpage and can also allow us to see if a cookie has been activated. Web beacons are also used to verify any clicks through to links or advertisements. We may use this information to inform advertisers how many customers have clicked on their adverts (the information shared with advertisers is aggregated and does not identify you individually).</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Tracking URLs: </strong> tracking URLs are a special web link that allows us to measure when a link is clicked on. They are used to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> How We Use Cookies And Similar Technologies </strong></p><ul>  <li><strong> Protect our networks: </strong> cookies and similar technologies help us identify and prevent threats to our sites. They are necessary to protect your information and our business from outside threats.</li><li><strong> Allow you to access our services: </strong> cookies and similar technologies permit your connection to our websites: our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, other software or hardware information, and your geographic location.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Access usage of services: </strong> we use information about your usage of our services and websites, such as the pages you have visited and content you have viewed to assess how our services are used.</li><li><strong> Provide ecommerce functionality: </strong> cookies and similar technologies help us provide functionality that you need to navigate our sites, select products and services and purchase them.</li><li><strong> Provide relevant content: </strong> the content for Services may be adjusted depending on what we know about the content, products and services that you like. This means we can highlight content we believe will be of interest to you. We provide personalisation by using cookies, IP addresses, web beacons, URL tracking and mobile app settings.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Selling third party advertising: </strong> we sell space on our websites and apps to advertisers. The adverts they display on our websites will often contain cookies. Our advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertisements that they believe are relevant. They may use browsing data obtained to restrict the number of times you see particular adverts (frequency capping). You may also see adverts from these advertisers on other websites you visit.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Third parties that support our Services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as allowing you to share content or tracking aggregate service usage, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect information relevant to the provision of those services. We do not control third party cookies or other technologies. Their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. You should make sure you are aware of how third parties will use cookies by checking the third party's cookie policy.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Cookie Controls </strong></p><p>  When you visit our sites for the first time you will see notices about the use of cookies by us and our partners. You'll be able to learn more about the specific cookies in use and how to control them. We will remember your preferences and may ask you periodically to confirm these. You are able to change your preferences at any time by scrolling to the bottom of the website page you are visiting and clicking on ‘Manage Privacy’.</p><p>  Most modern browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser.</p></div> <p><p>  In addition to being able to control cookies by changing the settings in your browser on your computer, or on your mobile device's settings, you can also control which companies can set cookies and similar technologies on your devices, by visiting the following links (you'll need to turn any cookie or ad blockers off for the control pages to show which companies you can opt-out of):</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Your Online Choices (<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank"> http://www.youronlinechoices.com </a>)</li><li>Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank"> http://www.networkadvertising.org/ </a>)</li><li>Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank"> http://www.aboutads.info/choices </a>)</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Importantly, these ad networks set cookies to remember that you have chosen to opt-out. If you clear your cache the opt-outs will not be applied and you would need to opt-out again.</p></p> <p><p>  You can prevent web beacons from tracking your activity, although you won't be able to decline receiving them in emails. For information about managing your cookie options, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org. </p></p> <p><p>  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features, content, or personalisation available on our websites.</p></p> <div><h4>  D.

For users based in the EEA, we may rely on the “Model Clauses” a standard document created by the European Commission to facilitate data transfers while ensuring that safeguards are put in place for personal information.

INFORMATION FOR RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA: YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4><p>  If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. The CCPA Notice applies to “Consumers” as defined by the law. This section describes your CCPA rights as a California Consumer and explains how to exercise those rights.</p><p>  <strong> Access to Information and Data Portability Rights </strong></p></div> <p><p>  You have the right to send us a request, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, for any of the following for the period that is twelve months prior to the request date:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</li><li>The categories of sources from which we collected your personal information.</li><li>The business or commercial purposes for our collecting or selling your personal information.</li><li>The categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.</li><li>The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</li><li>A list of the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose in the prior 12 months, or that no disclosure occurred.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>A list of the categories of personal information sold about you in the prior 12 months, or that no sale occurred.  If we sold your personal information, we will explain:
                    </li><li>The categories of your personal information we have sold.</li><li>The categories of third parties to which we sold personal information, by categories of personal information sold for each third party.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  You have the right to make or obtain a transportable copy, no more than twice in a twelve-month period, of your personal information that we have collected in the period that is 12 months prior to the request date and are maintaining.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Data Deletion Rights </strong></p><p>  Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete your personal information that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining.  Note also that we are not required to delete your personal information that we did not collect directly from you.  </p><p>  <strong> Exercising Your Rights </strong></p><p>  To make a request for access, portability or deletion according to your rights under CCPA, click <a href="https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/982b0a23-3053-4df0-9089-7ce3acd59c8d/1ced431a-163b-4a9c-bbc1-e605e085ae29.html" target="_blank"> here </a> or mail your request for the attention of the Privacy / Legal Department to Slimware Utilities Holdings, Inc., 555 West 18th Street, New York, NY 10011. California Consumers may exercise these rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the CCPA.  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Any request you submit to us is subject to an identification and residency verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”).</p></div> <div><p>  The Verifiable Consumer Request must:</p><ul>  <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</li><li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li></ul><p>  Some personal information we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough personal information about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).  As required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests.  If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.</p></div> <p><p>  We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer privacy rights requests.  We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not “sell” personal information that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of “sell” in the CCPA and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a do not sell request.  There is not yet a consensus as to whether third-party cookies and tracking devices associated with our websites may constitute a “sale” of your personal information as defined by the CCPA.  You can exercise control over browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser.</p></p> <p><p>  We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.  However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of good or service, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.</p></p> <p><p>  California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To find out more about our “do not track” practices under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 22575, see the “Do Not Track Disclosures” section of this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <div><h4>  N. YOUR NEVADA RIGHTS</h4><p>  Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the “sale” of certain “covered information” (as defined under Nevada law) collected by operators of websites or online services.   We currently do not sell covered information, as “sale” is defined by Nevada law, and we do not have plans to sell this information.  However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the Act, please contact us <a href="info@help.slimware.com" target="_blank"> here </a>. You are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes.
