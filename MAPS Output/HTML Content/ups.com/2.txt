This includes, for example, data identifying the actual location of a physical address using information such as GPS data, geocodes, latitude and longitude information, and images of the various locations.</p></p> <p><p>  In addition, when you visit our websites, use our apps, or interact with UPS-related tools, widgets or plug-ins, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken, and dates and times of activity. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages or apps to web servers and may be used to transmit information back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain and store “clickstream” data to tell us usage patterns. We may link certain data elements we have collected through automated means, such as your browser information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you. We also use third-party analytics tools that collect information about visitor traffic on our websites or apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all the features of our websites or apps. Both we and others (such as our advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities, over time and across third-party websites, when using our websites and apps.</p></p> <p><p>  We collect session analytics information, including browsing behavior, click patterns, keystrokes, and pages visited, when you visit our websites and applications. This information helps us understand our customers’ online activities, determine usage patterns, provide customer service and support, and improve and impair website functionality. This information is also helpful to our experience teams so they can design better experiences for you.</p></p> <p><p>  The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our websites and apps, such as Facebook “Like” button, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers.</p></p> <div><h3>  How We Use The Information We Obtain</h3><p>  We may use the information we obtain to:</p><ul>  <li>Pick up, deliver and track shipments</li><li>Provide products and services you request (such as logistics, supply chain management, customs clearance and brokerage services, and financial services)</li><li>Process and collect payments</li><li>Provide customer support and respond to and communicate with you about your requests, questions and comments</li><li>Send you tracking updates (from UPS and/or our business partners) and help you select convenient delivery options</li><li>Establish and manage your UPS account (including your online account on UPS.com and its various features, such as the address book and the UPS Billing Center)</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Offer you products and services we believe may interest you</li><li>Communicate about, and administer your participation in, special events, programmers, surveys, contests, prize draws and other offers or promotions</li><li>Enable you to post on our blogs and interact with UPS through social media</li><li>Send information to your contacts if you ask us to do so</li><li>Process claims we receive in connection with our services</li><li>Operate, evaluate and improve our business (including developing new products and services; managing our communications; determining the effectiveness of our sales, marketing and advertising; analyzing and enhancing our products, services, websites and apps; ensuring the security of our networks and information systems; performing accounting, auditing, invoicing, reconciliation and collection activities; and improving and maintaining the quality of our customer services)</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Perform data analyses (including market and consumer search and analytics, trend analysis and profiling, financial analysis and anonymization of personal information)</li><li>Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activity, claims and other liabilities</li><li>Comply with applicable legal requirements and our policies</li><li>Establish, exercise and defend legal claims</li><li>Monitor and report compliance issues</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  In addition, we use information collected online through cookies, web beacons and other automated means for purposes such as (i) customizing our users' visits to our websites and apps, (ii) delivering content (including advertising) tailored to our users' interests and the manner in which our users browse our websites and apps, (iii) improving website functionality and user experience, (iv) debugging, identifying, and repairing errors that impair the intended functionality of our websites, (v) providing customer service and support, and (vi) managing our business.
