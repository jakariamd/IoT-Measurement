</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Certain portions of this Section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Flurry agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. You or Flurry may elect to have any controversy, allegation or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Services or the User Data, including but not limited to claims for indemnification, contribution, or cross-claims in a pending action involving one or more third parties (collectively, a “Dispute”) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator under the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York; but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, Flurry must have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. You and Flurry will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Flurry to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then Flurry will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT (I) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; AND (III) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OTHER PERSONS. YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR FLURRY WANTS TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR FLURRY MUST COMMENCE IT WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>In the event either you or Flurry elects arbitration, for any Dispute where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 USD, the party requesting relief may further elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration must be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the specific manner must be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator is final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
