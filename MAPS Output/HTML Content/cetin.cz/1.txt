Data generated by networks in the provision of electronic communications services beyond operational and location data are necessary for maintaining and improving the quality of networks and services provided, solving any technical problems, complaints about the quality of the service, etc. </p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Data from communication with customers </li></ul><p>  These data are generated during communication related to the provision of services between CETIN and the customer. These are records of personal communication with the customer in direct contact, written and electronic communication and records of telephone calls, chat and other similar communications, etc. </p><ul>  <li>Processing data with your consent </li></ul><p>  The processing of such data is not necessary for the performance of the contract, CETIN’s legal obligations or the protection of its legitimate interests. However, it makes it possible to improve services and meet the interests and needs of customers in line with the development of IT technologies. These data are processed only if consent is given and may be processed for as long as the consent is valid. They include: </p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>data obtained from market research (processed based on consent to the processing of personal data for marketing and business purposes)</li><li>data on the use of services, products, benefits and bonuses and type behaviour when using the services (also processed with consent)</li><li>contact information for someone who is not a CETIN customer (processed based on consent to being contacted for marketing purposes)</li><li>records of behaviour on the CETIN website obtained from cookies when they are enabled in a web browser (they are processed to improve the operation of the CETIN website, internet advertising, and when consenting to the processing of personal data for marketing and business purposes, these data are processed together with other personal information for the relevant purpose). </li></ul></ul> <div><h5>  B. Purposes, legal reasons and duration of the processing of personal data</h5><p>  The extent of the processed data depends on the purpose of the processing. In CETIN terms, it is possible to process data for some purposes without the consent of the data subject, in particular based on a contract, for fulfilling CETIN’s legal obligations or if necessary for the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party; for other purposes processing is possible with the consent of the data subject.</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Processing for the performance of the contract, the fulfilment of legal obligations and for legitimate reasons </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Providing personal data necessary for the performance of the contract, the fulfilment of CETIN’s legal obligations and the protection of legitimate interests is mandatory. Without the provision of personal data for these purposes, it would not be possible to provide services. CETIN does not need the data subject’s consent for the processing of personal data for these purposes. Processing due to the performance of the contract and the fulfilment of legal obligations cannot be refused. </p></p> <div><p>  This applies mainly to the following basic purposes: </p><ul>  <li>ensuring the operation and protection of electronic communications networks (contract performance)</li><li>providing electronic communications services, payment transactions, providing other services (contract performance)</li><li>billing for services (contract performance)</li><li>information on requests for statements on the existence of networks, opinions on project documentation under discussion, questions on the issued statements on the existence of networks (fulfilment of legal obligations)</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>compliance with statutory tax obligations (fulfilment of legal obligations)</li><li>purposes stipulated by special laws for the purpose of criminal proceedings and for fulfilling the duty of cooperation with the Czech Police and other state authorities (fulfilment of legal obligations)</li><li>data exchange between network operators and providers of electronic communications services to ensure interconnection and access to the network, for mutual billing (contract performance)</li><li>operation of CCTV and monitoring systems on CETIN premises for the purpose of damage prevention (CETIN’s legitimate interest)</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>evaluating the customer’s behaviour in using the services and his/her payment discipline for the purpose of preventing debts occurring, which may influence CETIN’s decision on the conditions of concluding further contracts with the customer, where the decision on whether or not to conclude another contract is not automated (CETIN’s legitimate interest)</li><li>recovery of outstanding debts from the customer and other customer disputes (legitimate interest)</li><li>recording and monitoring calls to the customer line (contract performance)</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>customer identification processes (contract performance)</li><li>providing evidence to assert CETIN rights (legitimate interest)</li><li>records of debtors (legitimate interest)</li><li>records of misuse of the electronic communications network and services (legitimate interest)</li><li>CETIN commercial communication (legitimate interest)</li><li>ensuring the possibility of auditing the entry of individual persons into an operationally important building in order to protect the property of the data centre administrator and customers (legitimate interest)</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>records of persons authorised to enter an operationally important building by means of a bloodstream scan.
