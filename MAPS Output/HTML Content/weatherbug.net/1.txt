<b> Information Collection </b>
We collect the following types of information:

<b> Personal information </b> refers to information that identifies
specifically who you are, such as your name, e-mail address, or mailing
address. We may also ask you for demographic information or other information
such as ZIP Code, gender, date of birth and your interests. In many cases we
need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you
have requested. You may provide us with this personal information if you
register with WeatherBug, for a personalized service, submit pictures, video or
other user generated content, or participate in a promotion or sweepstakes. We
or our affiliates may also derive physical address information and infer other
general or precise location-related information from the information collected
from mobile devices, such as the stores and other places the device frequents,
or usage information for differentiating and/or associating multiple device
users as well as associating devices or users with locations such as a
household or workplace.

<b> Usage information </b> refers to information that we collect about
browsers, wireless networks and devices that access our Services. For instance,
we may collect information about how many users come to our Services, what
types of browsers and devices accessed the Services, IP address, browser type,
Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our
site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp,
clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site,
device platform ad ID, date and time of visit, web viewing and app use data,
wireless network performance, usage and identifiers, and precise location data.

information we collect as described above or derive through analytical
techniques, including combining personal and usage information together.

When you have installed or use a WeatherBug service, such as one of our mobile
applications, we may collect information about your device's precise location,
including your location relative to and within third party merchant locations
(in-store beacons). We may also collect data from cellular towers or WiFi
networks near a device to infer the location of a device. Our affiliates
including GroundTruth may also share location related-information with us. We
may collect or receive location-related information even if you are not logged
into or using the application.

<b> Digital Advertising & Your Choices </b>
We may partner with GroundTruth and with various third parties that engage in
interest-based advertising ("IBA"). This type of advertising involves
the collection of web viewing, location-related information and mobile
application use data from our Services and other non-affiliated websites and
mobile applications over time and across associated devices. This data is used
to infer interests and deliver relevant advertising back to a browser or
device, and to browsers and devices that are associated with each other.
Browser Choice: For more information about IBA, and to learn how you can
exercise choice regarding the practice on your browser for companies that
participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") WebChoices
tool, you can visit </span></span> <span><span>  http://www.aboutads.info/choices</span></span> <div><span>   or
TrustArc (</span><span>  click
here</span><span>  ).
App Choice: You may also download an application on your iOS or Android device
in order to exercise choice regarding the collection of mobile application use
activity for IBA on this device by companies that participate in those choice
tools. Links to those applications are below:
</span><span>  DAA
AppChoices iOS</span><p>  DAA
AppChoices Android</p><p>  TRUSTe
mobile app iOS</p><p>  TRUSTe
mobile app Android</p><span>  

Location Data Choice: The DAA's AppChoices tool can also be used to exercise
choice regarding the collection and use of precise location data by GroundTruth
for IBA purposes. To limit the collection of precise location data by other
parties through our application for a particular device, you can turn location
services off through your device's settings.

Note that electing to opt out from IBA will not stop advertising from appearing
in your browser or applications. It may make the ads you see less relevant to
your interests. In addition, note that if you use a different browser or
device, erase cookies from your browser, or reset your platform ad identifier,
you may need to renew your opt-out choice. In addition, companies may still
collect data in browsers or apps for non-IBA purposes such as for analytics and
reporting purposes, operations, improving our or their Services, and frequency
capping.

for uses other than the provision of our services or advertising
purposes, </span></div> <div><span>  click here</span><span>  .

We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you

receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device

certain information about your device for example the operating system type or
