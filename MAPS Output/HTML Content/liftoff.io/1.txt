These tracking technologies enable us to personalize the Services to Customers.</p></div> <p><p>  When you provide us with personal information about your contacts we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided in order to reach out to the individual nominated as a mobile hero. If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at support@liftoff.io.</p></p> <p><p>  B. Information We Collect and Use About Targeted End Users When They Interact With Our Customers’ Mobile Applications</p></p> <p><p>  If you are a Targeted End User, we collect certain device information provided by our advertising exchange Partners or our Customers which we process it for the following purposes (based on the following legal basis if you are located in the UK / EEA):</p></p> <div><td>  Personal Information</td><td>  Purpose</td><td>  Legal Basis</td><td>  Generic geographic location consisting of IP address and explicit geographical categorization such as country or zip code and then granular latitude and longitude coordinates (please note that this is subject to the capability of the advertising exchange that we use, and so this data is not always collected by us);</td><td>  Carrier;</td><td>  Device make, manufacturer, operating system and language settings;</td><td>  Name of application interactive with Liftoff Services;</td></div> <div><td>  Internet Protocol Address;</td><td>  Device ID;</td><td>  Browser type;</td><td>  Internet service provider (ISP);</td><td>  Android ID or Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA);</td><td>  Connection speed;</td><td>  App usage data;</td><td>  Referring / exit pages;</td><td>  Files viewed on our Site (e.g. HTML pages, graphic, etc.);</td><td>  Date / time stamp;</td><td>  Clickstream data</td><td>  To serve targeted ads to you</td><td>  Legitimate interests (providing Services to our Customers and to run, grow and develop our business);</td></div> <div><td>  Consent (where you have given it)</td><td>  To measure performance of and optimize our Customers’ marketing campaigns to you</td><td>  Legitimate interests (providing Services to our Customers and to run, grow and develop our business);</td><td>  Consent (where you have given it)</td><td>  To analyze trends in aggregated data and to analyze data to identify the demographic and interests of Targeted End Users across the app ecosystem</td><td>  Legitimate interests (providing Services to our Customers and to run, grow and develop our business);</td></div> <div><td>  Consent (where you have given it)</td><td>  Preserving and sharing information with others including law enforcement, responding to legal requests and establishing, exercising or defending our legal rights</td><td>  Legitimate interests (protecting our rights, personnel, property or products, or those of others); </td><td>  Compliance with legal obligations</td><td>  To follow applicable laws and regulations</td><td>  Compliance with legal obligations</td><p>  Our Privacy Principles for the use of data about Targeted End Users</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Liftoff’s systems aggregate events/data at granularities that cover many users, as opposed to a specific user, unless the user consents. For instance: users with iPhone X’s in San Francisco have clicked on ads in app A 100 times and installed app B 50 times.</li><li>Liftoff does not tie together events/data across apps in a user-specific way, without the user’s consent. For instance: we do not track that a person did X in app A and also Y in app B from a different publisher, if the person opts-out of interest-based advertising.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Instead, Liftoff only ties events/data from a given specific user within the context of a given app. E.g. user with app-local ID 123 installed app A, then finished the tutorial, then made a purchase.</li><li>This allows Liftoff to understand the conversion rates from one event to another within an app, but not track the activities of a user across different apps.</li><li>Liftoff does not record or store personal information that the user cannot easily revoke, such as email address, physical address, photographs or phone number to personalize our advertising. Liftoff relies upon device IDs to uniquely identify a user, and Liftoff solely relies upon the user’s consent in allowing Liftoff to access this information.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Liftoff does not export per-user data outside of Liftoff, except for validation purposes to a company that already has access to that data</li><li>Details of how to opt-out of interest based advertising from us can be found at: </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  C.
