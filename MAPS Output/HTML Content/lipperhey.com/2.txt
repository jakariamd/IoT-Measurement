We use cookies on our websites</h2><p>  Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your computer, tablet or mobile phone when you visit our website. There are several different types of cookies. We always place necessary cookies. These ensure the proper functioning of our website. For any other cookies (such as tracking cookies), we will inform you first on how to disable these. If you continue to surf our website, these cookies will be placed. The data we collect via these cookies are used to send you offers and show you suitable adverts. You can read more about this in our <strong> cookie policy </strong>, which you can find later in this document.</p></div> <div><h2>  15. External links</h2><p>  This website may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of these other websites. You can read these in the privacy statements on these websites.</p></div> <div><h2>  16. Updates to our privacy statement</h2><p>  Dataprovider has the right to change this privacy. This may happen, for example, in the case of new developments, business activities, online services, or if there are changes in the law or case law. We therefore advise you to check this privacy statement on a regular basis. This privacy statement was last amended on November 15, 2018.</p></div> <div><h1>  Cookie Policy</h1><p>  When you visit our website, we collect data to ensure that the connection runs smoothly. If you request a web page, the web server needs to know where to send the page and that is when we use your IP address. Your IP address is a number sequence that your internet provider assigns to your computer automatically every time you log on to the internet. It is used to identify your computer.</p><p>  Dataprovider.com may store personal data when you visit our website, such as the IP address. We will treat this information confidentially in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. We only use this information to reply to your questions and to analyze visitor behavior on the website for strategic purposes.</p></div> <div><h2>  1. What is a cookie?</h2><p>  Our website uses cookies. Cookies are small files which are saved to your computer's hard drive. They hold a small amount of data that is specific to a website and to you as a user. Because the cookies can be accessed by the web server, the server can deliver a page tailored to each visitor. This makes websites as user-friendly and interesting as possible for every unique visitor.</p><p>  Cookies are a convenient way to carry information from one session on a website to another, without having to burden a server machine with massive amounts of data storage. For example, the first time a user visits a site they may choose a username which is stored in the cookie. When the user provides data, such as password, preferred font size, page layout, etc. - this information is stored in the database using the username as a key. When the site is revisited, the server will read the cookie to find the username, and then retrieve all the user's information from the database without it having to be re-entered.</p></div> <p><p>  Cookies do not in themselves present a threat to privacy since they can only be used to store information that the user has volunteered or that the web server already has. No personal contact information, such as a telephone number or an e-mail address, can be derived from cookies. Cookies can not be used for marketing campaigns.</p></p> <div><h2>  2. Session cookies</h2><p>  Webpages have no memories. When a user is surfing between pages, the website would treat them as a completely new visitor each time. By using session cookies our website can keep track of your movement on our website so you don't get asked for information you have already provided to the web server. This also allows us to adjust our services to the search behavior and preferences of our visitors.</p></div> <div><h2>  3. Google Analytics and Adwords</h2><p>  The American company Google LLC places cookies with the users of our website as part of the 'Adwords' and 'Analytics' service. We use the Adwords service to track click behaviour. We use the Analytics service to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of our service, as well as tailor our website to the search and navigation preferences of our users. Google LLC may supply this data to a third party if it is legally required to do so or if another party processes that data on their behalf. This is something we do not control. The use of Google Analytics is regulated by and accepted under the General Data Protection Regulation.</p></div> <div><h2>  4. Hotjar</h2><p>  We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users' needs with the purpose to optimize our website and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users' experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don't like, etc.) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback.</p><p>  Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users' behaviour and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), operating system, browser type, geographic location (country only), the preferred language used to display our website, mouse events (movements, locations, clicks), keypresses, referring URL and domains, pages visited, date and time when our pages were visited. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf. For further details, please see the 'about Hotjar' section of Hotjar's support site.</p></div> <div><h2>  5. LinkedIn Insights</h2><p>  The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a piece of lightweight JavaScript code that we added to our website to enable campaign reporting and unlock insights about our website visitors, such as sector, education and city, to track conversions and retarget website visitors who landed via LinkedIn.</p></div> <div><h2>  6. HubSpot tracking code</h2><p>  The HubSpot tracking code is unique to each HubSpot account and allows HubSpot to monitor your website traffic. The tracking code is automatically included on HubSpot blog posts, landing pages, and website pages.</p></div> <div><h2>  7.
