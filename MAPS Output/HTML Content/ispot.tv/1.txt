</li></ul><p>  Our Company uses a two-step process to complete any online Right to Delete request (but not for any other type of verifiable request). If you submit an online Right to Delete request, we will contact you to confirm that you would like your personal information deleted.
</p></div> <div><ul>  <li>
Requests to Know
</li></ul><p>  You have the right to request, up to two times per year, that we disclose the following information to you about our collection and use of your personal information:

</li><li>
Verifying Requests to Delete, Correct, or Know
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  We may not grant your request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. We will attempt to verify your request with the information you provide and the information that we already have about you. For this reason, your request must both:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</li><li>describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you have a password-protected account with our Company, we may require you to verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for the account. As an additional security measure, we shall also require you to re-authenticate yourself before deleting, correcting, or disclosing your personal information.
</p></p> <p><p>  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. Only you, or your properly authorized agent, may make a request related to your personal information. To be certain that anyone claiming to make a request on your behalf has been properly authorized by you, we may require additional information, including:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>proof that you gave the agent the signed authorization to submit the request </li><li>require you to verify your own identity directly with us.</li><li>otherwise directly confirm with us that you have provided your authorized agent permission to submit the request.
