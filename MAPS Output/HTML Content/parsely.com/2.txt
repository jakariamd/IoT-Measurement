We also have a dedicated data privacy team. </p></div> <div><p>  Learn more about our data privacy best practices:</p><p>  Outside of data privacy standards, Parse.ly tops Google Analytics when it comes to providing valuable tools and insights for content teams. <a href="https://blog.parse.ly/parse-ly-and-google-analytics/" target="_blank"> Learn how we’re different </a>.</p></div> <div><h2>  Parse.ly makes data easy for editorial teams, giving them the insights they need to grow audiences, improve loyalty, and drive monetization.</h2></div> <div><h3>  Make data easy and actionable for everyone, not just analysts</h3><p>  Clunky web analytics and BI tools create a high barrier-to-entry for editorial teams.
