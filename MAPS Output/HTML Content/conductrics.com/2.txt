<div><h3>  Data Privacy & Integrity</h3><p>  Rather than a strategy of proactively watching and recording everything your visitors do, Conductrics was designed from the ground up to store as little information needed to run your A/B tests and other projects.</p><p>  For Testing and Predictions, we keep only the minimum information required to provide the aggregated counts and other statistics we provide in our reporting. No IPs or Customer IDs need be exposed to or stored by Conductrics.</p><p>  For surveys, you can provide your own database to store the individual survey responses. This places the records directly under your control, where you can apply your internal data governance practices directly.</p></div> <div><span>  Control over rollouts</span></div> <div><h3>  Deploy With Confidence</h3><p>  Testing and market research only works if everyone trusts the implementation. Conductrics provides tools to carry out experiments and surveys correctly and safely.</p><span>  Confidence during implementation</span></div> <div><h3>  QA and Preview</h3><p>  Tools to verify that your tests and surveys are just right before launching.</p><span>  Condidence Through Awareness</span></div> <div><h3>  Notifications and Alerts</h3><p>  To keep on top of your Conductrics implementation and day-to-day operations.</p></div> <div><h3>  Team-Based Organization</h3><p>  Simple management tools to assign team responsibilities appropriately.</p><p>  Keep users, tests, and optimization projects organized with teams. Use roles to grant the right access levels.</p><p>  Let all your users view reports, while letting only certain users set up tests, and others the ability to push to production.</p><p>  Protect your account with Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP 2FA/MFA). Optionally require 2FA again to deploy to production. SSO via SAML also supported.</p></div> <div><span>  Conductrics</span><span>  Platform</span><span>  Company</span><span>  Docs</span><p>  Â© 2022 Conductrics.
