<div><h1>  Best Buy Privacy Hub</h1></div> <div><h2>  A privacy resource for our customers.</h2></div> <div><h2>  Protecting privacy on your devices.</h2></div> <div><h2>  Learn how to protect your privacy.</h2><span>  Best Buy cares about your privacy, and we want to ensure you have the information you need to protect your personal information. Read about how to spot and avoid online scams and access links for additional fraud-prevention resources.</span></div> <div><h2>  Privacy Policy — Here are the highlights.</h2><span>  As a general rule, privacy policies are written by lawyers for lawyers. We hope you find these highlights to instead be a clear and transparent summary of our Privacy Policy, but please keep in mind that the full legalese of our Privacy Policy is below. California, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia residents can also find additional information consistent with applicable state law on our <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/privacy-policy/state-privacy-rights/pcmcat204400050063.c?id=pcmcat204400050063" target="_blank"> State Privacy Rights page </a>.</span></div> <p><p>  With those disclaimers out of the way, here’s our most important highlight:   </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Best Buy’s purpose is to enrich lives through technology. We will only collect, use or share your personally identifiable information for that purpose. And we don’t sell (as “sell” is traditionally defined) your personally identifiable information to anyone else.</li></ul></ul> <div><h3>  Personally identifiable information.
</h3></div> <div><h3>  Collection.</h3><p>  We may collect information relevant to you in three ways. First, we may collect information directly from you. This could be as part of your interactions with Best Buy personnel, such as at our retail stores or during in-home visits, or when you provide information via our digital properties such as websites or mobile apps.</p><p>  Second, we will collect such information by observing behavior — either in the “real world” or through our digital properties like websites and mobile apps. Examples include security cameras at a retail store, our websites tracking visitor activities on our sites, or our digital properties collecting the characteristics of the visiting devices.    </p></div> <p><p>  Finally, we may obtain such information from independent third parties, independent of you. </p></p> <div><h3>  Use.</h3><p>  We will use your information to meet your expectations and give you a great experience with Best Buy. For example, that could be to fulfill a purchase, provide a service, make our digital properties run better, or maintain our My Best Buy® program.</p><p>  You’ve probably seen in the news that the world (especially the internet) has too many fraudsters, hackers and criminals. We use information we collect to protect our customers, Best Buy, and others from such bad actors.</p></div> <p><p>  And remember when we said above that our purpose is to enrich lives through technology? In order to do that, we'll want to tell you about technology and other products and services that we think you’ll find useful. That means we’ll use information to try figure out what will be useful (or just fun and interesting) to you and others, or develop new or different products and services. And if we think we’ve found something you might like, we’ll use information to send or place marketing messages to you, on our own behalf or on behalf of others, and monitor your response to that message.
</p></p> <div><h3>  Sharing.</h3></div> <div><h3>  Have any questions about our privacy practices?  Just ask! 
</h3><p>  Whew! Even the “highlights” get a bit long. And the full Privacy Policy follows (California, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia residents, there’s also <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/privacy-policy/state-privacy-rights/pcmcat204400050063.c?id=pcmcat204400050063" target="_blank"> specific language and definitions </a> consistent with applicable law), but we thought you’d appreciate our summary above. If you still have questions, here are a few ways you can contact us:</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Phone </strong></p><p>  1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289)</p><p>  <strong> Email </strong></p><p>  <strong> Address </strong></p><p>  Best Buy Corporate Campus</p><p>  Attn: Customer Care/Privacy</p><p>  7601 Penn Avenue South</p><p>  Richfield, MN 55423-3645</p></div> <div><h2>  Best Buy Privacy Policy.</h2><ul>  <li>This Privacy Policy applies to Best Buy and Pacific Sales retail stores, other locations and events under the Best Buy name, and digital properties owned or operated by Best Buy Co, Inc. and any of our subsidiaries, unless that digital property or subsidiary has its own privacy policy (which would instead apply).</li><li>Our <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/privacy-policy/state-privacy-rights/pcmcat204400050063.c?id=pcmcat204400050063" target="_blank"> State Privacy Rights page </a> includes definitions and content consistent with state-specific laws. </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Some products and services that Best Buy offers may have supplemental details about information collection, use, and sharing relating to those products and services.

Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.</p></p> <p><p>  We may permit third-party service providers to collect and process some information from our digital properties. We may share personal information with those providers and may have similar arrangements with interest-based advertisers. We provide more information about interest-based ads below. Our digital properties are not designed to respond to “do not track” requests from browsers.</p></p> <div><h3>  Location information. </h3><p>  Some of our digital properties may collect your location to, for example, help you search for one of our stores, use special mobile features within some of our stores, or provide you with helpful messaging in our mobile app. We also may use this information to determine whether to provide you with content, information, and notices that may be required by law based on your location.</p><p>  Mobile devices often provide users with the ability to adjust settings related to location. If you do not want us to collect specific location information, you may modify the location services on your mobile device’s settings. Best Buy has no control over your device’s settings. And adjusting these settings does not completely eliminate the ability of others to develop location information about your device.  </p></div> <div><h3>  Store cameras. </h3></div> <div><h3>  Reviews and other content you provide.</h3></div> <div><h2>  How we use the information we collect: </h2><ul>  <li>Customizing your digital experience</li><li>Fulfilling orders and requests for products, services, or information</li><li>Processing refunds, returns, and exchanges</li><li>Tracking and confirming online orders</li><li>Delivering and installing products</li><li>Maintaining or administering Best Buy memberships or protection programs</li><li>Marketing and advertising products and services</li><li>Conducting research and analysis</li><li>Managing our My Best Buy Credit Card program, including taking applications and actions to enhance card usage and service</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Preventing and identifying fraud and other illegal activity</li><li>Engaging in internal uses such as data analytics with the purpose of enhancing existing and creating new products and services</li><li>Complying with and enforcing applicable legal requirements, contractual obligations (including our contractual obligations with you, such as through our My Best Buy program, if applicable, or digital properties’ terms of use), relevant industry standards, and our policies</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  How we share your information.
