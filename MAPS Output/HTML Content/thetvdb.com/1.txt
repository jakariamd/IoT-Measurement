</li></ul><p>  The Site collects information from You when You use it. Some of this information may be considered “personal information” under various applicable laws. We consider information that identifies You as a specific, identified individual to be personal information (such as Your name and email address), and we treat additional information, including IP addresses and cookie identifiers, as “personal information” where required by applicable law. Note that we may de-identify personal information so that it is non-personal, such as by aggregating it or converting it to a code (“hash”). We will treat de-identified information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law. 
</p></div> <p><p>  We collect information when You visit or interact with the Site, including:
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Information You Submit. </strong> The information You submit to us will depend on how You engage with us.  For instance, if You create an account with us, You will need to provide Your contact information (Your name and email address) and a password; if you are using the Site to share information publicly such as your custom lists, or to identify your favorite series or movies, you will need to provide information about those preferences and interests and if You are subscribing to receive the TVDB API, You will need to provide payment information. You may also upload entertainment related and other content to the Site, and we may ask for additional information either through the Site or through surveys, such as demographic data, Your experience with the Site, or information about Your opinions, interests and preferences.

Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system You are using, the URL or advertisement that referred You to the webpage You are visiting, all of the areas within the Site that You visit, Your time zone, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. In addition, we automatically collect Your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device You use to access our Site.

                </li></ul></ul> <div><p>  The methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:
</p><p>  <strong> Cookies and Local Storage </strong>small text files stored locally on Your device that help store user preferences. These technologies are able to store a unique identifier for a device to us to recognize the device whenever the device is used to visit the Site. These technologies may be used for many purposes by us, our service providers, and our third-party business partners, such as automatically collecting Usage Information, enabling features, serving advertisements to You on our Site, and remembering Your preferences. We may use cookies and other technologies to study traffic patterns on the Site, to study the effectiveness of our customer communications, and to personalize Your experience through the Site, such as to recognize You when You return to them. The information we store includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. If You do not want to accept cookies, You can block them by adjusting the settings on Your Internet browser.

</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Web beacons (also known as clear GIFs and pixel tags) </strong> are small pieces of code used to collect usage analytics. They help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When You ask us to send You information or a promotion or a newsletter, we will use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.
</p></p> <p><p>  We use similar tools to collect such information from mobile devices. In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>
<strong> Social Media Platforms </strong>. TheTVDB.com permits You to interact with social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.

You may also choose to participate in a way that connects that third-party service with our Site, such as posting to one of our pages on a social media site.

</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>How We Respond to "Do Not Track" Signals
</li></ul><p>  Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals offered by some web browsers are settings that request that a web application disable its tracking of an individual user. When You choose to turn on the DNT setting in Your browser, Your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services You encounter while browsing to stop tracking Your activity. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context.  Like many websites and online services, we may not alter our practices when our systems receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser, except as specifically required by law. You can learn more about Do Not Track at <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank"> www.allaboutdnt.com </a>.

</li><li><strong> Other California Rights for Non-Business Users </strong>
</li></ul></div> <p><p>  California residents who provide companies conducting business in California with information primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, have the right to request certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as WNI does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. WNI will provide You choice prior to sharing Your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If You do not opt-in or if You choose to opt-out at the time WNI offers that choice, we will not share Your personal information with that third party for its direct marketing purposes.
