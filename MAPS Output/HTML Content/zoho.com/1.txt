Some of Zoho's own technologies and applications may be hosted in a domain that is a third-party to the domain that you may be visiting. However, our commitment extends to these domains (cdn.pagesense.io, js.zohocdn.com, *.zohopublic.com, zoho.in, zoho.com.au, zoho.com) equally.</p><p>  However, Zoho does not allow third-party tracking companies to set cookies or other trackers on our website as part of our commitment to protect the privacy of our users with the utmost care. When we embed content that is hosted on a third-party's platform on our website, the third-party may set cookies on your browser which are usually for the purposes of providing the service as intended (such as for bandwidth management, to store your preference of language, tracking consent and for collecting anonymous statistics such as the number of times a video has been streamed). Wherever possible, we choose the most privacy friendly options such as Privacy Mode, Anonymous Statistics Only, to ensure we guarantee you privacy. However, some of the properties of such embeds may not be fully under our control such as our ability to control cookies that are set by these third-parties unilaterally when the webpage embedded with such content loads.</p></div> <p><p>  Here is the list of the cookies set by such third-party company embeds on our website.</p></p> <div><td>  PREF</td><td>  This cookie stores your preferences and other information, in particular preferred language, how many search results you wish to be shown on your page, and whether or not you wish to have Google’s SafeSearch filter turned on.</td><td>  8 months</td><td>  YouTube</td><td>  YSC</td><td>  Registers a unique ID to keep statistics of what videos from YouTube the visitor has seen.</td><td>  Session</td><td>  YouTube</td><td>  VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE</td><td>  Measures your bandwidth to determine whether you get the new player interface or the old.</td></div> <div><td>  8 months</td><td>  YouTube</td><td>  use_hitbox</td><td>  Increments the views counter on the YouTube video</td><td>  8 months</td><td>  YouTubes</td><td>  sc_anonymous_id</td><td>  To implement, measure and improve their embedded content/service on the website - The collection of data also includes visitors’ interaction with embedded content/service.</td><td>  3650 days</td><td>  SoundCloud</td></div> <div><h3>  How you can manage cookies?</h3></div> <div><h4>  Cookie preference manager</h4><p>  You can manage your cookie preference anytime by clicking on `Manage Cookie Preference` at the top of this page or via the Cookie icon that appears at the left bottom most corner of the webpages (if you visit from the EU, UK, Brazil, Japan or California regions).</p></div> <div><h4>  Browser settings</h4><p>  Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences.
