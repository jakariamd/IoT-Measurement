To find out when a product will be back in stock, submit your email address on the product page and we will send you a notification the moment your product is available. Or, contact one of our helpful customer service agents for an expected shipping date. Backorders are a top priority and we do our best to get our products back in stock and out to our customers as quickly as possible. Most items are in stock within the week if they show backordered online. If a product does not show as backordered online, it should be in stock and ready to ship. Coming Soon Products that are marked "Coming Soon" should be available for sale on our site shortly. Availability dates vary from product from product. Please contact our customer service team to get an estimated date of availability for a particular product. Discontinued Unfortunately, if a product shows as "discontinued" on our website, it is no longer for sale. All cartridges have a lifespan.

Compatible cartridges can be a brand new cartridge or a remanufactured cartridge, depending on what's available for your printer model. Usually if a cartridge is a new compatible or remanufactured, the supplier will mention it in the their product description. No matter what you get, both cartridge types work equally well and should match the quality of the genuine product. Compatible ink and toner: A brand new compatible cartridge is built by a third party manufacturer and is designed to fit and function in your specific printer, it's like buying the generic version of the genuine brand. In order to avoid infringement on a patented design, some compatibles might have slight design differences from the original. Despite any structural difference you may notice, the cartridge will still fit and print a full yield, just like the original brand. Remanufactured ink and toner: Remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use. After use, the cartridge is recycled, acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process. During the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled, thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality. It's then carefully refilled, tested again and brought back to life! Remanufactured cartridges are great for the environment. Every remanufactured cartridge you buy is one less cartridge ending up in a landfill.

First is to utilize any page count your printer has. Refer the user's manual for instructions. The other way is to count reams or boxes of paper you have used with each cartridge. Both of these methods will tell you how many pages per cartridge you are using. Please keep in mind that although both methods provide you with an approximation, your cartridge's yield will ultimately depend on your printing practices. You should also take into consideration the typical print coverage on the pages that you are producing. For instance, if you only print short memos you will reach - or, come close to - the manufacturer's stated page yield. In contrast, if you write full page letters or print graphics, your page yield will be considerably less. A cartridge with a 4000 page yield, for example, will run out of ink or toner at around 800 pages when used to print full pages of text and graphics with a high percentage of ink or toner coverage. To find out how many pages your cartridge will print, scroll down to the specifications table on one of our product pages.

The best way to determine the average cost per page is to take the price of the cartridge and divide it by the page yield. For example, a genuine HP62XL high yield black ink cartridge costs $36.99 and has a page yield of 600. After doing a little math, the cost is around 6 cents per page. On the flip side, you can purchase a genuine Brother LC107 high yield black cartridge for $29.99 with a page yield of 1,200. The cost for the Brother cartridge would be around 2.5 cents per page.

Page yield is the approximate number of pages that can be printed with a particular cartridge. Since everyone's printing habits are different, actual page yield can vary from user to user. In order to hold manufacturers accountable to the same standards, every ink cartridge is subjected to page yield testing based on ISO/IEC 24711 specifications. This test helps determine what the page yield of an ink cartridge will be, giving customers a reliable way to compare competing products. The manufacturer's cited page yield for ink and toner cartridges is given at 5% coverage. This means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only 5% of the page has been imprinted with ink. This comes out to be a small amount of imprinted ink - roughly one quarter of the page. For example, a short memo has approximately 5% coverage. If you are printing letters, using legal size paper, printing photos, web pages or any type of graphics, your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly.

Printers that use the HP 902 cartridge can use any of these cartridge sizes. HP ink cartridges usually only come in standard and high yield sizes with the high yield version having "XL" at the end of the cartridge number Standard Yield: HP 902, prints 300 pages High Yield: HP 902XL, prints 825 Pages Extra High Yield: HP 906XL, prints 1,500 pages HP toner cartridges: HP toner cartridge sizes are named a bit differently. A standard HP toner cartridge is signified by an "A" at the end of the cartridge number, the high yield version is signified by an "X" at the end of the cartridge number, and many extra high yield versions have a "Y" at the end of the cartridge number. Below are some examples: Standard Yield: HP 37A, prints 11,000 pages High Yield: HP 37X, prints 25,000 Pages Extra High Yield: HP 37Y, prints 41,000 pages How Canon names their cartridges: Canon follow the same format as HP inkjet cartridges with XL indicating a high yield cartridge and XXL for extra high yield cartridges. Let's look at the Canon PGI-250 ink cartridge an example: Standard Yield: Canon PGI-250, prints 300 pages High Yield: Canon PGI-250XL, prints 500 Pages Extra High Yield: Canon PGI-255XL, prints 800 pages Canon toner cartridges: Canon doesn't have the higher yield option for most of its toner cartridges but the ones that do have will either have "H" or a "II" at the end of the cartridge name. For example, the Canon 131 series names it's toner cartridges like this: Standard Yield: Canon 131, prints 1,400 pages High Yield: Canon 131 H, prints 2,400 pages How Brother names their cartridges: Brother ink cartridges are not as easy to pin down. Some follow a similar format to HP and Canon, with XL indicating a high yield cartridge and XXL for extra high yield cartridges. While others use slightly different part numbers to differentiate between cartridge sizes. To be absolutely sure, check your printer guide for compatibility. Let's take the Brother LC203XL ink cartridge an example: Standard Yield: Brother LC201 Black, prints 260 pages High Yield: Brother LC203XL Black, prints 550 Pages Brother toner cartridges: Brother toner cartridges also have different names for each cartridge size. The TN820/TN850/TN880 cartridge series is a great example. Double-check your printer's user guide for cartridge compatibility.

The yield corresponds to the number of prints you are expected to get from a given cartridge. A standard yield cartridge is the most common cartridge size on the market. It yields a smaller number of prints than the high yield or extra high yield, and is sold at a cheaper price. For customers that don't print very often, spending a bit less for a standard yield cartridge makes sense. If you know you aren't going to use very much ink, why pay more a higher capacity cartridge? A high yield cartridge holds more ink than the standard cartridge and as a result, offers considerably more prints. High yield cartridges are more expensive but are often worth the extra money for print heavy consumers. The extra high yield option isn't all that common, but as the name implies, it holds even more ink than the high yield. In a nutshell, there is a print capacity that fits everyone's needs. If you print regularly, paying a little bit more for a high yield cartridge is worth it in long run because you will usually get a lot more prints than your average standard yield cartridge. Because there is no standard naming convention for high yield cartridges, there are some variations on how printer manufacturers name their cartridges. How HP names their cartridges: For HP, let's take a look at the HP 902 ink cartridge. The 902 comes in three sizes: standard, high yield, and extra high yield.

The type of paper purchased should effectively represent the company's specific business needs, as well as its overall corporate image. Whether the printer paper is used for printing high definition images, daily office correspondence or binding contracts, selecting the right paper will ensure the final product comes out looking crisp and professional. There are three main attributes to consider when choosing copy paper: paper weight, brightness, and whiteness. Simplify the paper buying process by familiarizing yourself with each attribute and start stocking up! Paper Weight Simply put, when choosing the correct paper weight keep in mind the function you want the paper to serve. As a general rule of thumb, heavy paper is effective for professional documents, while lighter paper is ideal for everyday use. In more specific terms, regular copy paper is often referred to as a "20 lb. bond" or "50 lb. text weight". On the other end of the spectrum, a sturdy stock is listed as "Index" or "Cover" followed by a specific weight. "Index" or "Cover" paper is frequently used to make postcards, menus, index dividers, brochures and more. Brightness Color contrast is a key factor in producing good looking documents. The brighter the paper, the brighter and lighter the output. Although the official definition of brightness is quite technical, in layman's terms the brightness scale is used to indicate the amount of light refected from the surface of a paper. Paper brightness is numerically ranked from one to a hundred; the higher number indicating a greater level of brightness. On the brightness scale, standard copy paper has a rating between 80 and 100. When producing images keep in mind that on less bright paper images often come out much darker. These general rules can vary based on the model of printer used and whether the paper is inkjet photo paper, matte finish or glazed finish. Whiteness The term whiteness refers to the quality of light, or in this instance the specific shade of the paper. Generally speaking, the whiteness index is devised so that the higher the whiteness, the whiter the paper material. In order to differentiate between brightness and whiteness think of the following: brightness is equivalent to wattage, while whiteness indicates shade. Whiteness is a particularly important attribute to consider when buying paper for color printing. Overall, the delicate balance between ink/toner and paper shade will dictate the final result.

Shopping for a printer can be overwhelming if you don't know where to start. Before you make your purchase, think about what your printer's primary purpose will be. Where do you plan to use the printer? What type of documents will you need to print? How much money do you want to spend on ink? With so many printers on the market, taking the time to map out your options is the best way to ensure you find the perfect fit. This guide should give you a good idea of where to begin your search, starting with the basics of print technology. Inkjet or Laser? There are two main print technologies to consider: inkjet and laser. Inkjet printers are a great choice if you are a casual home user or photographer. They are typically equipped with either two ink cartridges or four, depending on the machine you own. A two cartridge set up includes a black ink cartridge and tri-color ink cartridge, while the four cartridge set up includes black, cyan, magenta and yellow ink. Inkjets offer a variety of print solutions for a reasonable price and many are compatible with a wide range of media types. Most retailers sell either a multi-function or single function option. Multi-function machines are much more popular due to their versatility and their ability to seamlessly switch between print, scan and fax functions. If all you do is print, a single function machine is your best bet. Single function printers are a lot easier to operate and require far less maintenance. Inkjet printers are not for everyone however. Genuine brand ink costs can add up quickly and if you regularly print in high volumes, your print time will take much longer compared to a laser jet. Laser printers are a nice option for home office or small business consumers. Instead of using ink to print, they use a cartridge that is filled with toner powder. Since toner powder is dry, cartridges can last for several months in a machine. A longer shelf life means you can go on vacation and still have a working printer when you get back! Many companies like laser printers for their speed and ability to print precise, crisp text at a high capacity. The majority of laser printers are monochrome, or print solely in black and white. For a business that prints a lot of color graphs or pamphlets, color laser printers are another option. They won't produce the same vivid photos that an inkjet printer will, but they are perfect for offices that like to incorporate a bit of color into their monthly reports. Toner cartridges are more expensive than inkjets, but their high toner capacity make them a worthy investment. If you do a lot of text heavy printing and a lot of photo printing, it might be worth your time to invest in both types of machines. You will save quite a bit on cost in the long run and get the exact sort of quality you need whenever you need it. Print Speed If you print at a high volume and have multiple people using the same machine, then printer speed is definitely an important factor to consider. Printer companies call a printer's speed PPM, or pages per minute, and the quality of a print can vary depending on how quickly you are churning out pages. For example, printing in draft mode may be faster but the end result isn't going to look as good compared to a print in optimal mode. Laser printers tend to be much faster than an inkjet and are the preferred machine for a business that has a need for speed. Duty Cycle A printer's duty cycle is the number of pages a printer can print within a given month without any issues. Duty cycle can vary across machines and if you do a lot of heavy duty printing, it is something worth paying attention to. Heavy users should also take note of their monthly print volume, or the number of pages you typically print each month. Duty cycle and average print volume statistics are included in the specs of each machine. If you usually print 6,000 pages a month, it wouldn't make sense to invest in a printer that only handles 3,000. For users that only print a handful of copies each month, duty cycle probably won't be a concern. Total Cost of Ownership Owning a printer is expensive over time. Most consumers own an inkjet machine for at least five years, and a good laser printer can last considerably longer if it's well taken care of. However, the cost of consumables can add up quickly. These are just a few potential costs that can quickly drain your wallet if you're not careful: Page Yield - A printer's page yield is the approximate number of pages that can be printed with a particular cartridge. Page yield varies from machine to machine. It's important to compare cartridge price and page yield across machines to make sure you are getting the best bang for your buck. Cost of ink - Ink cartridges are pricey. Before you settle on a printer that seems like a great deal, take the time to do the math. The cost of ink is calculated by dividing a printer's page yield by the cost of the ink cartridge. For example, the price of a genuine HP® 63XL black ink cartridge is $40.99* and its page yield is 480 pages. After a bit of division, the cost is 8.5 cents per page. Comparatively, you can buy a genuine black Canon® PGI-280XXL cartridge for $34.99, which offers a page yield of 600. The cost per page for the Canon is only 5 cents a page, giving you more ink for a cheaper price. This is why cartridge price and page yield really play a crucial role in determining what printer you should buy. Switch to a reputable aftermarket cartridge and the cost difference is even more remarkable. If you were to buy a LD brand remanufactured HP 63XL black cartridge at $29.99, your cost would only be 6.2 cents per page. A LD brand compatible PGI-280XXL is priced at $11.99. With a cost of 1.20 cents a page, the savings are significant. Replacement Parts Printer parts do not need to be replaced that often but if want your machine to last, proper upkeep is essential. Print heads, drums, fuser assemblies or transfer belts all have a limited life cycle. Your printer's user guide should provide some wear and tear guidelines and most office supply stores sell replacements. Be aware, some printer parts can be just as expensive as the printer and it might be cheaper to get an entirely new machine if a part goes bad. When buying a printer, pay attention to the cost of all of the consumables, not just the cartridges. You probably won't be thinking about the cost of a new drum at purchase time but you'll be glad you checked the price knowing that you will have to replace it further down the road. Wireless and Smartphone Printing Wireless printing comes standard with most new machines, meaning you no longer have to be tethered to a computer in order to print. Apps like HP® ePrint® or Apple® Airprint® make printing from a smart phone or tablet incredibly convenient. Wireless printing isn't always perfect, so make sure you have a USB cable on hand just in case your connection gets spotty. Warranty A 1 year warranty is standard for most printers and it typically just covers factory defects. Damages caused by the improper cartridge installation or physical damage is often not covered, so if you tend to be a bit heavy-handed with your machine, an extended warranty might be worth a look. Extended warranties cost extra but cover maintenance parts like drums and transfer belts. Contact your manufacturer for specifics on your printer model. Reviews Don't forget to read reviews! Reading the specs on a printer only tells part of the story. Be sure to read actual customer reviews to make sure other customers are satisfied too. Amazon is a good place to start, but you can also find reputable feedback on CNET or PCMag. With new printer models coming out every couple of months, there are a lot of options out there. But if you've got a good understanding of you are looking for, making a smart buy should be a breeze. Don't jump on a printer solely based on the sticker price. Owning a printer is a long term investment. Whatever you choose, make sure it fits your needs and your budget! Need new ink cartridges?

To figure out which type your printer uses, you will need to do a bit of research on the cartridge series that is compatible with your machine. You can find the ink type of your cartridges on the cartridge page of your printer manufacturer's website. Both cartridge types offer high quality text and color prints, but you may prefer one over the other, depending on your printing needs. Why choose dye-based ink cartridges? Most inkjet printers on the market traditionally include dye-based inks. They are more economical than pigment based ink cartridges and are appreciated for their ability to produce vibrant, true to life color prints and photos. Dye-based inks are not waterproof and can be susceptible to smudging, with many prints tending to fade after 25 years. Why choose pigment-based ink cartridges? Pigmented-based ink offers a crisper finish and a quicker dry-time than dye-based ink. It is valued by professional photographers and graphic designers for its ability to print archival quality images and text. Pigment ink tends to resist water and UV light better than dye-based ink, and is able to resist fading for up to 200 years. It is often more expensive, and lacks dye ink's brightness and broad color range.

Once installed on your computer, drivers covert the information that different programs make into printable formats for your printer. Without drivers, printers wouldn't know how to resize and reorganize information from webpages to fit onto whatever size of paper that you use in your printer. Printer drivers are basically there to tell your printer how to make what you end up seeing on the page look as close as possible to what you see on your screen. When you are installing your printer for the first time or trying to resolve a printer issue, your printer may ask you to download the printer driver. You can find the printer driver download on your printer manufacturer's website.

Almost all new printers are AirPrint compatible, which means they can print wirelessly with your Mac, iPad or iPhone. Connecting with AirPrint is the easiest and fastest way to get your Mac working with your printer. You can check your printer's user guide to confirm if your printer works with AirPrint. How to add a printer using Airprint As long as your printer and your Mac are on the same wireless network, your printer should automatically be able to print through Apple AirPrint. To check if AirPrint is working, turn on the printer, open up a document or photo, then select File>Print on your Mac to print. Your printer name should appear under the "Printer" pop up. If it prints, AirPrint is working and you don't have to set anything up. If it doesn't print you may need to manually add your printer to AirPrint. Under the "Printer" dropdown menu, select "Add Printer" and then select your printer from the list of printers that are available on your Mac. That's it, now you can print with AirPrint! If AirPrint is not working or you would prefer having a direct connection to your printer via a USB cable, try one of these alternative installation methods. How to Add a Printer with a USB cable A USB cable provides a direct connection from your printer to your Mac. If your printer did not come with a USB cable, you can try connecting your Mac wirelessly through Airprint, or you can buy a USB cable. Older printers used to include a USB cable along with the printer but as wireless printing has become the norm, most new models no longer come with a cable. This is frustrating for anyone that wants to directly connect to their printer or wants to avoid dealing with the hassle of wireless printing, but inexpensive generic USB cables are available and they are compatible with almost every printer model. For more information on printer USB cables, check out this article. Connect your printer USB cable and turn on your printer. Your printer may ask you to download the latest software to continue with the set up. Download this software to proceed with the installation. If your printer doesn't ask you to download anything, your printer is already up to date and you can continue to the next step. Follow the steps to complete the set up, then try printing out a test page to see if the installation worked. Open up a document or photo, then select File>Print on your Mac to print. If your printer still is not printing, follow the steps below to manually add a printer to your Mac. How to manually add a printer to a Mac Connect your printer USB cable and turn on your printer. Select "System Preferences" under the Apple menu, then select the "Printers & Scanners" icon Your new printer should be listed on the left side of the "Printers & Scanners" menu. If it is not listed, click the (+) button to add a new printer. Click "Default" in the "Add" window Click the printer name and your computer will auto-populate other printer details like the name, location and printer driver. If your computer cannot find the correct driver, you may need to manually populate that field. The printer driver is software that comes with your printer. Once installed on your Mac, drivers convert the information that different programs make into printable formats for your printer. If you select the wrong driver or an outdated driver, your printer will not function. Click on "Select Software" in the drop-down menu to locate the most recent driver for your printer model, then click "Add" to install. If you are not able to find an appropriate driver, you can download one from the printer manufacturer's website.

Here are a few simple tips for Windows 10 users that will help you get your printer back online so you can continue printing. Check the offline status of your printer 1. First, make sure that your printer and your computer are on the same wireless network. You can check what wireless network your printer is on by accessing the wireless network settings on your printer's display screen. Check your printer manual for specific instructions on how to pull up your wireless information. 2. Double check that your printer hasn't been switched to "Offline" mode. To do this, go to Start>Settings>Devices>Printers & Scanners. Then select your printer and go to "Open Queue". Under "Printer", make sure "Use Printer Offline" is not checked off. Set your printer to default 1. Go to Start and search for "Control Panel". Under the "Control Panel" menu, select "Devices and Printers". Right click on the printer you'd like to set as default, then select "set as default". If you see a message that says, "Windows will stop managing your default printer for you," select "OK", then try printing again. Reset the printer spooler In search bar, type "Services". Then, in the "Services" menu scroll down until you find the "Print Spooler" service. Right-click and select "Restart". The printer spooler helps your printer organize what documents needs to printed and in what order. If one document in the print queue is producing an error, it can hold up any other documents that are also in the print queue and prevent your printer from printing. Restart Your Computer It may be obvious, but sometimes a simple restart is all you need to get your printer up and running again. Reboot your computer and try printing again, it might be just what the printer doctor ordered! Reset Your Printer Another simple but often overlooked fix is a printer hard reset. To reset your printer, power it down and unplug it from the wall for about 30 seconds. Then plug it back in, power it back on and try printing again.

This cleaning function cleans the printhead inside your printer, which works with your printer cartridges to create a print. Running the cleaning function on a PIXMA printer is easy and you can do it right on your printer's display screen! 1. Make sure the printer is turned on and paper is in the paper tray 2. Select the set up icon on the display screen 3. Then, select "Maintenance" 4. Select "Cleaning" and then select "Yes". The printer will run through the cleaning process for 1-2 minutes. 5. After the cleaning process is complete, your printer will ask if you want to print the nozzle check pattern. Select "yes" and the printer will print out a nozzle check or print diagnostics page. 6. If the nozzle check patterns appear full, the cleaning worked and you can continue to use your printer. If the pattern is faint or broken, you may need to run the cleaning function again. Sample of a good print quality diagnostics page Sample print quality diagnostics report with the black cartridge streaking Sample print quality diagnostics report with the magenta color missing We recommend running the cleaning cycle 1-2 times if you aren't getting the print quality you want. Some Canon PIXMA printers also have a "Deep Cleaning" option that you can also try. Keep in mind, cleaning the printhead does deplete some of the ink in your cartridges.

Although installation for most printers is fairly simple, certain printers can be somewhat tricky. If you don't have the guide that is included with the printer, you can find a free downloadable PDF version on the printer manufacturer's website. Just search for your "printer model name + user guide" on Google and you should be able to pull up the guide instantly. There are a few different ways to install your printer… Automatically installing your printer with a USB cable Many printers include a USB cable that connects the printer directly to your computer or laptop. When you connect the cable and turn on the printer, most computers recognize that you are trying to install a new printer right away and automatically download the appropriate printer driver for your machine. The printer driver is the software that the printer uses to communicate directly with your computer. Without it, the printer will not be able to function. If your computer does not detect the software automatically, you can manually download the printer driver (more on that below). If your printer does not come with a USB cable, you will need to buy a cable or use the cable from your previous printer if you want to use your printer via USB. Some printer manufacturers have stopped including USB cables with newer printer models as most users prefer to set up the printer over Wi-Fi and do not use the USB cable, but it is still nice to have one around to instantly set up a printer for the first time. Manually downloading the driver software You can also install your printer using the driver software on support page of the printer manufacturer's website. To find the correct driver software, search for your "printer model + driver software" on Google. Or, search for your printer directly on one of the printer manufacturer support pages listed below. After you download the software, the printer will take you through the installation process. HP Printer Support Canon Printer Support Epson Printer Support Brother Printer Support Installing your printer with a CD If you are not able to locate a downloadable version of your printer driver, you can also use the installation CD that is included with the printer. Installing the driver with a CD is the same process as downloading the driver on the manufacturer's website, however, during the process you may be prompted to update the printer driver software to ensure you have the latest driver software installed.

Some printers even accept extra high yield cartridges. Standard yield cartridges are filled with less ink, and therefore are less expensive than a high yield cartridge. Higher yield cartridges are filled with more ink, offering more prints at a generally better value. Installing a high yield cartridge is no different from how you install a standard cartridge. Both will fit in the same cartridge slot in your printer. If your printer's user guide lists both a standard yield cartridge and a high yield cartridge as compatible with the machine, the high yield cartridge should fit, the only difference between the two cartridges is the amount of ink that is in the cartridge.

Depending on what printer you own, you can check your printer cartridge ink levels on your printer's LCD display or on your computer. Consult your printer manual to determine the appropriate steps for your printer. Most ink cartridge level displays can be found under the "maintenance" section of your printer menu. Run a print diagnostic test. The print diagnostic test is a printed report that breaks down the health of each ink cartridge. The test prints a color sample of each cartridge and with that, you can tell which cartridge is performing poorly. Run a printhead cleaning, then try printing again. If you haven't printed in a while, your printer cartridges may just need to be primed. A printhead cleaning will usually do the trick. Check your printer manual for specific instructions on how to run the cleaning function on your machine. The cleaning process will take a couple of minutes. Once it is completed, print the diagnostic test again. If the test pattern is crisp, you are ready to print! If the quality is still poor, let the printer sit for about 10 minutes before running a second cleaning, this allows the ink to soak on the printhead. We walk you through the process below using an Epson WorkForce WF-3820, but the steps are similar no matter which printer you are using. Just consult you printer's user guide for your machine's specific steps. Try another cartridge. If the printhead cleaning did not work, it is likely time to replace your printer cartridge. Printer cartridges only have about a 2 year shelf life in their sealed package, and a far shorter lifespan if they are sitting idle in your printer. To get the most out of your printer cartridges, make sure you print regularly. We recommend printing at least once every couple of weeks to keep your cartridges in top condition.

To figure out how much you'll save, you can compare genuine brand cartridge cost versus the compatible cartridge cost, all you need to do is calculate the cost per page. The cost per page is one of the most important factors that contribute to the total cost of owning your printer. You will acquire an ongoing cost per page for as long as you own the printer, and the higher the cost, the more expensive the cost of operating your printer can be. Cost per page can vary widely depending on what cartridge your printer uses and the page yield that it offers. To determine the cost per page of a cartridge, you divide the price of the cartridge by it's page yield. For example, an original HP63XL high yield black ink cartridge costs $39.99* and has a page yield of 480. After doing a little math, the cost is around 8 cents per page. On the flipside, an LD-brand compatible HP 63XL cartridge is significantly cheaper at $29.99, offering a comparable page yield. After doing the same math, the cost per page is just 6 cents cents per page! *Savings based on price comparison between compatible cartridge prices and printer brand (OEM) cartridge prices effective as of October 29, 2020 on www.LDProducts.com and Staples.com.

The actual print speed depends on what you are printing (text or images) what cartridges you are using (black or color) the quality of the print and the paper type. Text documents on a "grayscale" printer setting are going to print much faster than a full color photo that is formatted to print at a high resolution. If you look at the specs of your printer you will notice that print speed is either measured in ppm or ipm. Ppm stands for "pages per minute" and ipm stands for "images per minute". While both sound similar, their calculation is slightly different. Ppm measures the print speed of a normal page of text - graphics and complex images are not included in the calculation. Images per minute is considered to be a more accurate way to gauge print speed because it uses the same standard set of Word, Excel and Adobe test pages in its calculation. Whether your printer uses ppm or ipm to calculate print speed all depends on the printer model. For example, the Brother MFC-J995DW specs feature a print speed of 12 ppm in black and 10 ppm in color. Comparatively, the Canon Pixma TR8520 printer specs feature a print speed of 15 ipm in black and 10 ipm in color. Need new ink cartridges?

Restoring to default is also a great way to prevent personal information like passwords and security settings from being accessed by a third party if you are sending your printer in for repair, or plan to give it away or recycle it. For troubleshooting and printer error problems, we recommend trying a hard reset first. A hard reset also resets your printer but it doesn't restore it to factory default settings. This is a better first option if you've already customized your printer settings or set up your wireless connection, that way you won't have to start back at square one. How to do a hard reset on your printer With the cartridges still installed, power down the printer and then unplug the power cord from the wall. Wait for a minute, then plug the printer back in and power it back up. Wait for the cartridges to center and then try printing again. Restoring the factory-set defaults returns most of the settings to the factory defaults. With HP printers, it won't reset the page count, tray size, or language. Consult your printer's user guide for specific reset instructions for your machine. If you don't have your printer user guide handy, you can usually find a digital PDF version on your printer manufacturer's website. We cover the instructions for a few popular printer models here.

A lot of cartridges look identical, cartridge part numbers can be confusing and even similar printer models can appear to take the same cartridges when in fact they don't! To top it off, certain printer manufacturers are better about telling you what cartridges their printers use than others. To help you make sure you're buying the correct cartridge, we've made a list of a few of our favorite cartridge confirming tips. 1. Check for the cartridge part number on the front of the machine. Some printers have a sticker on the front that tells you what the cartridges are. This Brother printer, for example, works with the TN-223 standard yield cartridges and the TN-227 high yield cartridges. Both of these cartridge series are the same size and fit in the printer the exact same way. The only difference is, the high yield includes more toner powder inside the cartridge, which gives you more prints per cartridge! 2. Check for the printer cartridge part number inside the printer. Some printers, like the HP Officejet Pro 9015 below, include the part number in the cartridge access area of the printer. The access area is usually found underneath the scanner of the printer. 3. The easiest way to confirm that you have the correct cartridges is to simply check inside the printer! If you have an existing set of cartridges already installed, open up the cartridge access area to confirm the cartridge part number. You may need to wait for the cartridge carriage to center before you can see what the cartridge part number is. 4. Some printers also let you look up the cartridge part number on the printer's display screen. The Canon printer below included the cartridge information under the "settings" section of the display menu. 5. If you can't find any cartridge information on your printer, you can always check your printer user guide. Every user guide includes information about which cartridges will work with your printer. Most often, you will find it in the cartridge installation section of the user guide. If you don't have a physical copy of your user guide, you can find a free digital PDF version on the printer support page of the printer manufacturer's website. 6. Another great place to check is the printer product page of your printer manufacturer's website, or the the printer product page on LD Products.com! Just search for your printer and you'll find a complete list of compatible cartridges. 7. Still not sure what cartridge to buy? Contact our knowledgeable customer service team!

If your printer uses a toner cartridge with a built-in drum and you are having printing issues, please go to this article. Poor prints are usually a pretty easy fix. Check out our tips below to get your drum unit clean in just a few simple steps! Check your printer settings First check to make sure that your printer settings are not set to "toner save" mode, which can create lighter prints because it uses less toner. Uncheck the box to remove the printer from "toner save" mode. Clean the corona wire If the printer settings look good and you are still getting a drum error message on your machine, you may need to clean the corona wire on the drum unit. To do this, slide the green or blue tab back and forth across the drum unit 6-8 times, then return the tab back to its original position and try printing again. Inspect and clean the drum roller After the corona wire is cleaned, check that the drum is clear of any toner buildup, scratches or damage. Toner buildup on the drum is a common reason for spotty or smudged prints. 1. If the toner and drum unit are connected together, you will need to remove the toner from the drum unit. To do this, push down on the green or blue lever on the drum unit to release the toner from the drum and set aside. Skip ahead to the 5 second mark on the video below to see how to remove the toner from the drum... 2. Turn over the now empty drum unit and locate the white gear on the back. 3. Move the gear with your thumb to rotate the drum roll, wiping away an excess toner particles as you rotate with a lint-free cloth or cotton swab. This roller is photosensitive, avoid touching it with your fingertips. Redistribute the Toner Powder Before you install the toner back into the drum, gently rock the toner cartridge over a trash can to redistribute the toner powder. Sometimes toner powder can escape from the cartridge during this process, so we recommend doing this over a trash can. After this is complete, reinstall the toner cartridge / drum and try printing again.

Just like the number of pages each toner cartridge can print is different, the same is true when it comes to drum units. Drum units generally can print at least 12,000 pages before needing replacement. Depending on how many pages your Brother cartridge prints, most drum units reach that 12,000 page mark after the use of 3-4 cartridges. To find the actual number of pages your drum unit can print before it needs to be replaced, it's best to refer to your printer's manual. For example, the Brother TN-760 toner cartridge prints 3,000 pages and the DR-730 drum unit has a yield of 12,000 pages, so after the use of around 4 TN-760 toner cartridges, it will be time for a new drum! When a drum reaches the predetermined rotation limit to the related page yield, a "drum life end soon" message will appear on your printer's display. If you are installing a new drum unit for the first time, you will need to reset the drum counter to restart the rotation count on your printer. Again, you will want to look at your specific printer manual for instructions on how to rest the counter since the steps are slightly different with each machine. If you've installed a new drum and the drum life is not at "100%" then the drum needs to be reset so it can start the drum count over again. Have a question about your specific Brother drum unit?

If your printer uses a toner cartridge with a built-in drum and you are having recognition issues, please go to this article. Drum Fitting Issues If you are getting an error message, first check to make sure that the toner cartridge and drum unit are properly installed. The toner cartridge should click securely into the drum unit and the two components should be connected together in piece before installation. Then, slide the secured components together into the printer to install them. Cleaning the Corona Wire If everything is installed correctly and you are still getting a drum error message on your machine, you may need to clean the corona wire on the drum unit. To clear this error, slide the green or blue tab back and forth across the drum unit 6-8 times, then return the tab back to its original position and try printing again. Resetting the drum Some drum units require a reset upon installation. Reset instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Consult your printer's user guide for the specific drum reset steps for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. We show you how to clear the "Replace Drum" message on a Brother MFC-L2700DW laser printer here. Still having trouble? Contact our customer service team so we can further assist you!

Cleaning the gold contact chip If your drum is not recognizing in the printer, there may be an issue with the gold chip on the end of the toner cartridge. This chip communicates with the printer to create a print and if it is not reading properly, the toner / drum unit will not work. Sometimes fingerprint oil or dust can cause this error. A hard reset usually gets the drum recognizing and working right away. Please follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the recognition issue: Remove the cartridge drum and turn the printer off. Then unplug the machine from the wall. Let it sit empty and unplugged for about a minute Take a soft, lint-free cloth and gently wipe the gold colored connection area on the cartridge drum to ensure a clean connection Plug the machine back in and turn it on Reinstall the cartridge and try printing a test page This should resolve the recognition issue right away and get the toner / drum working correctly.

Cartridge manufacturers include this clip to protect the cartridge while it is in transit. If your cartridge is not fitting properly in the printer, it may be because this clip is still on the cartridge. Depending on the cartridge, the clip may be black, orange, yellow or teal. You can recycle this clip after installation. If you plan on removing the printer cartridge from your printer for a period of time, we recommend holding on to the clip and putting it back on the cartridge for safe storing while it's outside the printer. Most printer cartridges with an integrated printhead will include a clip around the cartridge. Examples include the HP 62, HP 63, HP 64, Canon PG-245 / CLI-241 and Canon PG-260 / CLI-261. Some individual ink cartridges might include a clip too, like the HP 902 series and the HP 910 series. To remove the clip, hold one hand on the cartridge and gently pull the the clip off with your other hand. You may want to do this over a trash can, as some ink might escape from the cartridge during this process. Have a question about how to remove your cartridge clip?

If you are printing out a document like an email where print quality isn't an important factor, switch your printer to this setting! You can also tell your printer to print just in black by adjusting your printer settings to "grayscale" or "black ink only." Grayscale often uses some combination of both the black and color inks to produce black text in order to keep all of the cartridges primed, but the amount of color that gets used is nominal. How to adjust your printer settings in Windows: Pull up the printer menu, or hit "Control + P" on your keyboard Select printer properties The location of "draft mode" "economy mode" and "grayscale" varies depending on your printer. You may need to click around the printer settings menu to find it but it is typically located under the "Quality" or "Color Options" submenu.

Brother printers use printheads to create a print, which inevitably get clogged over time. The cleaning function is usually found in the "settings" or "maintenance" section on the printer display screen. Your Brother ink cartridges should be cleaned if you are experiencing spotty or light print outs or if your printer has been sitting idle for a while. After the cleaning is complete, you can try printing a test page to see if the print quality has improved. If the quality is still poor, run the cleaning a second time. Sometimes a second cleaning makes all the difference! We don't recommend running the cleaning any more than that. Every time you run the cleaning function you are using up some ink and if you run it multiple times, you can deplete your cartridges pretty quickly. We include step-by-step instructions for the Brother MFC-J775DW All-in-One printer below. The process should be similar with any other Brother inkjet printer but for specific instructions for your machine, we recommend consulting your user manual. You can find a PDF copy of the user manual on Brother's website. How to Clean a Brother MFC-J775DW Printer Press the "settings" button on the display screen Press the down or up arrows to navigate to "Ink / Maintenance" and press "OK" Select "Printhead Cleaning" and press "OK" Here, you can choose with to clean just the black ink cartridge, color ink cartridges or all four cartridges. Select "Black only" / "Color only" / "All" to clean your desired cartridges and press "OK" Next, you can decide how thorough you want the cleaning to be. Remember, the deeper the cleaning, the more ink gets used up. Select "Normal" / "Strong" / "Strongest" and press "OK" Press "Black Start" or "Color Start" to begin the cleaning To see if the cleaning improved the print quality, print out a test page and check the nozzle pattern. If the nozzle pattern is faded or spotty, you can run a second cleaning. How to Print a Print Quality Test Page with a Brother MFC-J775DW Printer Select "Settings" on your printer's display Press the down or up arrows to navigate to "Ink / Maintenance" and press "OK" Select "Impr. Print Quality" and press "OK" Select "Impr. Print Quality" again and press "OK" Select "Color Start" The display screen will ask about the print quality. If the lines appear clear, press the right arrow to select "No" and press "OK". Then press "Stop / Exit" to finish the quality check. If lines are missing in the printout, press the left arrow to select "Yes" and then press "OK" The display screen will ask you to confirm the print quality of each color. Use the arrows to select the pattern the matches your current print quality results and the press "OK" If a second cleaning is required, press "OK" If a cleaning is not required, press "Stop/Exit" on the maintenance screen to end the quality check. If you have run multiple cleanings and are still having quality issues, you many need to buy new cartridges. Have a question about cleaning your Brother printer?

This can be very frustrating with ink prices being what they are and some printer owners suspect that this cleaning is just a way Brother depletes their cartridges faster so you buy more ink. While it is true that this process does use a small amount of ink, it is a necessary function to maintain the health of your cartridges. These calibrations help keep your printer free of any ink build up or air that may have gotten in the printhead and without it, your printhead will dry out (which inevitably leads to buying more ink). Most Brother printers do a self-check every day to ensure that everything is operating smoothly. However, the printer isn't cleaning every time it makes a sudden noise. Sometimes it is just moving the printhead from the flushing box to the maintenance unit so the nozzles can be wiped. To keep your printer lasting longer and avoid frequent unwanted cleanings, we recommend printing regularly so your ink cartridges are always primed and ready to go. The longer you go in between prints, the more susceptible your cartridges are to drying out, so even if you print a simple test page or email every few days, you are doing your printer a favor. We also recommend keeping your Brother on at all times so your printer can do an automatic cleaning when necessary. If you turn your printer on and off frequently, it will want to do a more thorough cleaning when you turn it back on just to ensure your printheads are working properly. If your printer is left on, it can gradually maintain the printheads over time, which helps extend your printer life. Have a question about cleaning your Brother printer? Find us at LDProducts.com!

When you leave it on, you may hear the printer start up every once in a while and begin to calibrate. This is normal and is actually part of the printer's built-in maintenance routine. The printer needs to occasionally recalibrate to ensure the printhead and ink cartridges are primed and healthy. This process uses up a little bit of ink but it is necessary to keep your printer operating in top shape. Contrary to popular belief, leaving your printer on does not use up a lot of energy and most printers have a "sleep mode" function that kicks in after the printer has been idle for about 15 minutes, which helps conserve power. If you do need to turn your printer off, make sure to shut it down properly using the power button on the front of the machine. Clear out any pending print jobs from your printer queue and check that the cartridges have returned to their resting position inside the printer prior to shut down. If you unplug the printer from the wall and it hasn't been shut down properly, you could permanently damage your machine. Have a question about your specific printer? Find us at LDProducts.com!

You can often find this on the printer specs table on the printer manufacturer web page. Monthly duty cycle varies across printer models. If your office prints a lot, you will want to make sure you buy a printer with a generous monthly duty cycle (in the thousands of pages). If you don't print often, you probably will never reach your printer's monthly duty cycle, so it shouldn't be a concern. Going beyond your printer's monthly duty cycle may lead to worn out parts and eventually, shorten the lifespan of your printer. Before you buy, figure out the average number of prints your office goes through per month and be sure to that your proposed printer's monthly duty cycle exceeds those expectations.

If you are printing black text, your printer should only be using the black cartridge. If you are printing in gray, some color ink might be used to help you achieve the correct shading. Whenever the cartridges are primed or go through the cartridge cleaning process, black and color ink will be used to prime all of the cartridges, even if you are just printing with the black cartridge. To better preserve the ink in your black cartridge, check to see if a "black ink only" or "grayscale" setting is available for your printer. You can usually find this option under the "printer properties" menu of your printer. We show you how below!

Page yield is the approximate number of pages that can be printed with a particular cartridge. For the majority of our printer cartridges, you'll find the page yield listed in the cartridge specs table on the product page. This is a standardized value provided by the printer manufacturer that is based on the amount of ink inside the cartridge and ISO page yield testing (find out more on how page yield is calculated here). In some instances, the printer manufacturer may not provide the page yield and instead provide the cartridge ink capacity in milliliters (ml). When page yield is not available, we include the ink capacity in our specs table. This should be seen as a supplemental value as some printers can use the ink differently than others. If ink capacity is the only value available to measure the ink volume in your cartridge, we recommend printing with the cartridges to determine the approximate page yield for your printer use. Page yield and ink capacity are just two factors that help you determine how many printed pages you can expect to get out of a specific cartridge. Other factors like what you print, how often you print and whether you are printing in black, color, or a combination of both, also affect the number of printed pages, which can vary greatly from user to user.

Page Yield Page yield determines the approximate number of prints you can get out of a given cartridge. You can find the page yield for your printer cartridges on the side of the cartridge box or the printer manufacturer's website. Yield can be very different from cartridge to cartridge, which is important to keep in mind when you are shopping for a printer. If you recently purchased a new printer and you are not getting as many prints as your old printer, it is likely because the page yield of your new cartridges is considerably different. Even two printers with a comparable price point can have drastically different page yields. For example, the HP® Officejet 8710 is $119.99* and is compatible with the HP 952 cartridge series. The high yield black cartridge prints 2,000 pages and the color cartridges print 1,600 pages. A similar model, the Canon® PIXMA TS8220, is just a few more dollars at $126.77 and uses the PGI-280/CLI-281 ink cartridges. The high yield PGI-280XL cartridge only prints 400 pages and the CLI-281XL color cartridges print 515 pages. As you can see, page yield has a major effect on your printing efficiency, making it a very important printing factor. Infrequent Printer Use A seldom-used printer can quickly dry out your ink cartridges. Running a printer cleaning will often get your cartridges going again, but if you repeatedly leave your cartridges sitting idle in your machine, you will eventually need to get a new set of ink. We recommend removing the ink cartridges from your printer if you don't plan to use the printer for an extended period of time. Reapply the protective tape and cartridge clip that came with the cartridges and place them in an airtight plastic tub. Keep a damp paper towel in the tub with the cartridge and store it in a cool dark place. Alternatively, you could invest in a laser printer or ink tank printer if you are tired of dealing with dried out printer cartridges. Laser printers use toner cartridges, which won't dry out like an ink cartridge since the toner is made of a dry, powdery material. Ink tank printers like the Epson® Ecotank or Canon® Megatank rely on a refillable tank system and ink bottles to print, preserving the ink in a sealed tank until it is ready to be used. These are both solid printing options and worth looking into if you are considering a new printer and only print occasionally. Type of Documents Printed The type of documents you print can also influence your cartridge life. If you print in mostly black, your black cartridge will run out faster than the color cartridges. However, some printers will pull a bit of ink from the color cartridges when you are printing solely in black, just to keep them primed for future use. Color photos can also deplete your cartridges relatively quickly. Understanding your cartridge's page yield can give you a better estimate of just how many prints you can expect to get out of a cartridge. Page yield is based on 5% page coverage, or pages in which 5% of page is covered with ink. This is roughly the same as printing out a short email or paragraph. If you are printing something that uses more ink, like a photo or business proposal, your page coverage will be much larger and your page yield will drop considerably. Since everyone has different printing needs, the actual number of prints you get from a cartridge changes from user to user. Constant Printer Cleanings If you run a cleaning on your machine regularly, you may notice your cartridge ink levels slowly depleting. This is because the printer uses a small amount of ink every time you clean it, priming the cartridges for your next print in the process. Printer cleanings are a great way to help fix print quality, but if you've run a couple of cleanings without any improvement, it may be time to invest in a printer cartridge. Inefficient Printer Settings To get the most from your printer cartridges, you will want to make sure you are using the right printer setting for your print job. If you are printing strictly text, print in gray scale, the setting that only draws ink from your black printer cartridge. If you are printing out less important documents like a quick email or directions, print in draft mode, an economical printer setting that uses less ink to print out documents. For optimal color photos, switch your printer to the photo setting. Additional settings may be available depending on what printer you own. Need new ink cartridges?

In this example, we will show you how to locate the printer model name and serial number of the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-3730. The easiest way to find your printer model is by looking at the front of your printer. Depending on what printer you own, the model name could be on the corners or the center of the front-facing cover. If it is on the front of the machine, it is usually close to the control panel. The printer model number could also be located on the top of the machine in the corners or center. Here, we find the printer model name on the right front side of the printer to the right of the control panel. You can also find the printer model name on the set up / installation manual or installation CD included with your printer. Another way to figure out what printer you own is by looking for the printer serial number, which is unique to your specific printer. The serial number is on the sticker that is usually located on the back or the bottom of the printer. This number is important if your printer manufacturer needs further information on your printer. The sticker below was on the back of Epson WF-3730. You might also find the serial number on the inside of the printer too! When you lift open the cartridge door of the Epson WF-3730 to access the cartridges, the serial number is located on the left side of the machine near the cartridge access area.

Printers that use single color cartridges are often better at producing photos than tri-color cartridges since all three individual cartridges work together to create a print. They are also can be more cost-effective when it comes to replacement! You can replace each individual cartridge as needed, so if you are low on yellow, you just need to replace the yellow cartridge. Printers that use individual ink cartridges typically work with printers that have the printhead built into the machine. If you print frequently, this may need to be replaced eventually, so it's worth keeping in mind when considering the total operating cost of your printer. The HP 902 series and Epson 702 series are two individual ink cartridge examples. A tri-color printer cartridge contain all three colors (cyan, magenta and yellow) in the same cartridge. Tri-color cartridges have an integrated printhead built into the cartridge, so every time you replace the cartridge you are replacing the printhead. They are usually a bit cheaper than individual ink cartridges but will need to be replaced immediately if one particular color is running low, which can be inconvenient if you print a lot. HP and Canon are the two most common printer manufacturers that offer tri-color cartridges, like the HP 64XL series or Canon CLI-246XL series. Need new ink cartridges?

Most Brother printers include multifunction features, which means they can copy, print and scan D - automatic duplex printing (also known as automatic double-sided printing). This feature lets you automatically print on both sides of the page. DW - duplex and wireless printing CDW - color duplex wireless printing N- supports networking, or the ability to allow multiple computers to print to a single printer. T- includes dual paper trays. This is common with heavy duty office printers that need to support high volume workgroups. XL - these printers are part of the Brother extended printing line, which includes extra printer cartridges. Any printer that includes 2 sets of printer cartridges Brother labels as "XL". Many Brother Inkvestment printers and a handful of laser printers have an "XL" option. For every "XL" printer that is available, a cheaper, non XL version is also available that only includes one set of ink. The printers are identical, you are just paying more for extra ink when you upgrade to XL. For example, the Brother MFC-J995DW and Brother-MFCJ995DW XL are exactly the same printer, the only difference is the XL comes with twice the amount of ink.

Here, we provide a few easy ways to figure out which cartridges work with your machine so you can find the right ink, right away. Check the printer box Most printer manufacturers include the printer cartridge series directly on the printer box. In this example, HP included the cartridge name (HP 63 series) on the side and on the flap of the box. Check the inside of the printer Most printer manufacturers also include the printer cartridge name on the inside of the printer where you install the cartridges. This can be found in different areas of the machine depending on the design of the printer. If you have the cartridge bay open, the cartridge name should be labeled somewhere within that space. Consult your printer manual When in doubt, check the manual. A paper manual should have come along with the printer but if you don't have that, don't worry! You can find a free downloadable PDF copy on the printer manufacturer's website, just search for the "printer name" and "manual" on Google and you should be able to find it right away. Consult the printer manufacturer's website Another great place to confirm your cartridge part number is directly on the manufacturer's website. This option is a bit quicker than searching through your printer manual. Just look up your printer model and check for "supplies" or "related items" on the printer product page. To be extra sure, you can usually find the printer manual on this page too. Call an ink expert! Still having trouble finding your printer cartridges? Give LD Products a call!

Yield is uniformly determined across all printer cartridges by specifications laid out by the international standard for organization (ISO), an independent international body that develops industry standards for products. The ISO established page yield standards for the printing industry in the early 2000s as a way for consumers to reliably measure and compare cartridge page yield across printer manufacturers. With all major printer manufacturers held to the same testing and reliability standards, consumers can compare competing products and make an informed purchasing decision. Cartridge page yield is based on 5% page coverage, an ISO standard wherein 5% of the page is imprinted with ink. For example, a short email is roughly 5% page coverage, so if your toner cartridge offers a yield of 1,000 pages, your cartridge can print approximately 1,000 short emails. Since everyone's printing habits are different, the actual page yield can vary from user to user. Other factors, like the type of document you are printing and the print quality setting can affect the page yield. If you are printing a full page of text or color photos, your coverage will vary greatly and the cartridge page yield will be significantly less. ISO standards are similar to the miles per gallon (MPG) that is associated with your car. They are great for comparing the fuel efficiency across car models, but since driving habits are different from driver to driver, the actual mileage you'll get from your car can differ considerably. The same thinking can be applied to cartridge page yield and your printer! Need new printer cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

Test pages can also help you monitor print quality and printhead alignment by printing out blocks of text and color on to the page. If you notice any breaks in the print job or poor color quality, then some additional printer troubleshooting may be required. You can fix light or spotty prints with the cleaning feature that is included with your printer.

Canon labels their ink cartridges in this way to reference the ink type inside a particular printer cartridge. "PGI" stands for pigment based ink. Pigment based ink is ideal for printing documents; providing, rich, dark text and sharp output. Pigment ink tends to resist water and UV light better than dye-based ink, and is able to resist fading for up to 200 years. Some popular Canon "PGI" printer cartridges include the PGI-220, PGI-225, PGI-270 and PGI-280. "CLI" stands for ChromaLife, a term that Canon created for labeling it's dye-based ink cartridges. Dye-based ink prints bright, vibrant colors that are perfect for photo printing. They are more economical than pigment based ink cartridges but can be susceptible to smudging, with many prints tending to fade after 25 years. A few common "CLI" printer cartridges include the CLI-221, CLI-226, CLI-271 and CLI-281. Need new ink cartridges for your Canon printer?

The easiest way check is to run a test print on your printer. Most printers have a test print or diagnostic print option built into their software. A test print prints out a diagnostic pattern of all of your cartridges. If one of the colors is smeared, the wrong color, or faded, you've likely located the problem cartridge. To run a print test on your machine, consult your printer manual for specific instructions. Most print tests can be found under the "maintenance" or "tools" menu of your printer. Alternatively, you can also run a test print within Windows: From Windows 10, go to "Printers and Scanners." Right click your printer and select "manage." Then select, "print a test page."

Check the box your printer came in. Most printer boxes clearly display which cartridges are compatible with the printer right on the box. Find your printer model on the manufacturer's website. The appropriate cartridges should be listed on the printer page. Look for the cartridge part number on specifications table or under the "supplies" section of the printer page. Find your printer model on LDProducts.com. A list of all of the compatible cartridges for your specific printer are included the printer page. For example, if you search for "Canon Pixma MX922" on our website and navigate to the Canon Pixma MX922 printer page, you will find a list of all of the available cartridges for that printer. Check inside your printer for the cartridge part number. Many printers include the cartridge part number near the cartridge carrier (the space where you install the cartridges) for easy reference. Consult your printer's user guide. A user guide should be included with the printer. If you no longer have it, you can find a free downloadable version on the printer manufacturer's website. For example, if you search for "Canon Pixma MX922 user guide" you can download the appropriate manual directly from Canon's website. Contact us! We'd be happy to help you find the correct cartridge for your printer.

Paper is housed in the printer's paper tray, and most trays can be found along the bottom of the printer. There is usually a small notch on the face of the tray that pulls out so you can insert the paper. Within the paper tray, you will notice a guide that can be adjusted to fit your preferred paper length. 8.5" x 11" is the standard adjustment size but most printers can adjust to smaller sizes like 4"x 6" and 5"x 7" for printing photos. You'll also want to keep the printer's paper capacity in mind. Every printer has a recommended paper capacity. For example, the HP ENVY Photo 6255 we feature below has a capacity of 125 pages. An overstuffed paper tray can lead to unwanted paper jams! Once you have adjusted the guide to the appropriate length, all you need to do is load your stack of paper into the paper tray, close up the tray and start printing. We recommend checking your printer's user guide if you are having trouble locating the exact placement of the paper tray, or if you are unsure about the paper capacity. Need new ink cartridges?

This is often caused by an issue with your drum unit, which is the electrically charged cylinder that transfers toner powder on to the paper. Or, it could be an issue with the fuser, which is responsible for heating the toner powder onto page. There are a few troubleshooting techniques worth trying that should fix this: Check your printer's environment - Keep your printer in a dry room as humidity can cause toner powder to clump, affecting your print quality. Make sure you are using the right paper - Inkjet and laser printers work best with specific types of paper. If the paper is too thick, glossy or not designed for laser printing, the toner powder may not be able to adhere to the page correctly. Adjust the paper setting - If you are using a specific type of paper, like laser printer paper, make sure that the paper setting matches the paper type. Usually a quick paper setting adjustment will clear up a ghosting issue right away. Run a cleaning - Most printers have a cleaning function built into the machine. Run this a couple of times to attempt to clear up the printing issue. Inspect the drum - Sometimes excess toner powder can stick to the drum. To clean it, gently wipe down the entire surface of the drum with a lint-free cloth. Then, slide the corona wire back and forth a few times. If the drum unit does not appear to be the issue, you can try cleaning the fuser or you may even need to replace the fuser all together. Cleaning and replacement instructions for fusers vary across printer models, so you will need to consult your specific printer manual for step-by-step instructions.

There are a couple of ways you can try to resolve this error message. First, check to make sure that your printer is plugged in to a working power source and that the printer is turned on. If you are using a USB cable to print from your computer, make sure that is plugged in as well. If you are using a Wi-Fi connection to print, you may need to restart your wireless router. Wait for the router to reboot and then try restarting your computer to reestablish a connection with your computer. A pending print job could also be the root of the problem. Clear or delete any pending documents from the print queue. If your printer still doesn't come back online, you may need to reinstall the printer driver. You can find a free downloadable copy of your printer driver on the printer manufacturer's website. Need new printer cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

This is a super convenient feature if your office regularly makes a lot of copies, saving both time and potential frustration. Most automatic document feeders are capable of handling anywhere from 20-50 sheets at a time, depending on the printer model. It's important to note that automatic document feeders can only scan one side of the page. If you are looking to automatically scan both sides of the page, you'll need to find a printer that includes a duplex automatic document feeder. Need new ink cartridges?

The best way to prevent an ink cartridge from drying out is by running a small print job every week, this keeps your cartridge primed. Be sure to print something with all four cartridge colors (black, cyan, magenta and yellow) in order to keep all of the cartridges primed. If you haven't printed in a while, run the printhead cleaning function on the printer. This is another way to prime your cartridges, and will likely get them working again. You may need to run the printhead cleaning a couple of times to get the best results. Toner cartridges use a dry plastic toner powder to produce a print, so the do not dry out like an ink cartridge, but they can clump. Check our our video below to learn how to run the printhead cleaning on Epson Workforce Pro WF-3820. These steps are similar with most printers, just consult you printer's user guide for your machine's specific steps. Need new ink cartridges?

When not in use, keep your cartridges in sealed in their original packaging and in a dry environment. Humidity and moisture can affect print quality. During shipment, cartridges may be placed in various positions and this can cause the ink to settle at the opposite end of the cartridge, which may result in printing issues. For optimal performance, before using your cartridge, place it in the upright position for a few hours to allow the ink to move to the bottom of the cartridge.

Here are a few simple tips that will ensure you get the full life out of your toner: Keep cartridges at room temperature, preferably in a dark space like a desk drawer or supply cabinet. Do not remove the toner from its sealed packaging until you are ready for installation. Although the cartridge will not go bad if it is out of the box, it can be exposed to dust and other particles that could affect print quality. Store your toner cartridges horizontally. Vertically stored toner cartridges will cause the toner powder to shift on the inside of the cartridge and can easily stick to the walls of the cartridge. Many cartridges have a small gold contact chip on the back side of the toner. This chip is how the cartridge communicates with your printer and is very sensitive. Try to avoid touching this chip with your fingers, as it could cause a faulty connection with your printer. If you do accidentally touch the chip, you can gently wipe it with a lint-free cloth. Gently shake the cartridge back and forth a few times over a trashcan before installing it into your printer. Occasionally some toner powder may escape from the cartridge during this process, so shaking over a trashcan is key. This will redistribute the toner powder that may have been stuck on the cartridge wall. Need to replace your toner cartridge? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

An abrasive soap may help if there is a lot of ink on your hands. If a bit of ink ends up on some fabric, you will want to act quickly! Dab the affected area with a clean, damp paper towel until the ink stops coming off the paper towel. Let the stain air dry for a few minutes, then spray the stain with hair spray or dab it with alcohol to loosen the ink's grip on the fabric. Dampen two paper towels and sandwich the affected area of fabric. Blot the backside of the stained fabric to transfer the stain to the paper towel. As you are pressing, be sure to keep using fresh parts of the paper towel to avoid re-applying the ink you have just removed from your shirt. Repeat this cycle a couple times until the ink is gone.

The drum unit is an electrically charged cylinder that transfers that toner to paper. A drum unit can be incorporated with the toner cartridge or sold separately as a single unit, depending on the consumable requirements of your printer. Laser printers and their consumables vary across printer models. These subtle differences can be a bit confusing if you are not familiar with the consumables that are specific to your printer. All laser printers require a toner cartridge and a drum unit to produce a print. However, some printers only need you to replace the toner cartridge, and others require that you regularly replace both the toner cartridge and the drum unit. Most printers use toner cartridges with the drum unit built into the cartridge. If your printer uses a toner with an incorporated drum unit, there is no need to replace the drum separately, since it is already a part of the toner cartridge. Every time you buy a new toner, you are replacing the drum. Some printers, like most Brother laser printer models, for example, use a separate toner and drum unit. In this case, the drum unit is not built into the toner, and therefore, it must be replaced, typically after the use of 3-4 toners. Your printer should inform you when it's time to replace the drum, but you can usually tell your drum is on it's last legs if you start to see black spots or lines across the page. To determine whether your printer uses a toner cartridge with an incorporated drum unit, or if your printer sees the drum unit as a separate consumable, consult your printer user manual.

The refill kit instructions included here are universal for a few different HP ink cartridges, including the HP® 60, HP 61 and HP 901 standard yield and high yield cartridges. We recommend using a previously used original HP cartridge with our refill kits, as they will get you the best results. This refill kit includes: A set of cartridge labels - which tells you where you need to insert the needle into the cartridge. One 3ml Syringe A Pair of Gloves One Fixing Base One Syringe Needle Tissues One Screw Plunger One Screw Bracket Instructions Step 1: Start by peeling back the original label of the cartridge so you have an idea of where to refill. If you peel back the original label, you will see a few different holes on the face of the cartridge. To refill the cartridge, make sure to insert the needle into the correct hole. A sticker is included with the kit that matches up with the proper refill hole. Make sure you choose the right sticker for your cartridge, as the placement of the needle and the amount of ink required for the cartridge is different for each series. Place the sticker on top of the cartridge where the label is fixed. When placed properly, the dot should line up directly above the refill hole. If the sticker is improperly placed, you will not be able to insert the needle into the cartridge. Step 2: Position the cartridge so that it is firmly secure in the back of the fixing base, with the nozzles facing straight down. Push the top of the cartridge down until it snaps into place. Step 3: Take the syringe, screw bracket and needle out of the package. Connect the syringe and screw bracket by twisting clockwise. Then, insert the needle into the top of the syringe and twist off the cap. Step 4: At this point, you will probably want to put on the gloves that are included in the kit, as this can get slightly messy. Lay out paper towels on your workspace and have a handful of them nearby too, just in case the cartridges leak a bit. Insert the needle into the cartridge using the template sticker as your guide. When you insert the needle, you will feel it pushing through the sponge inside the cartridge, so you will notice a little resistance but that's okay. Step 5: Gently turn the plunger clockwise and slowly dispense the ink. Make sure you are filling the cartridge to the appropriate capacity. The HP 61 cartridge should be filled to roughly 4 ml. You can measure the amount of ink by the scale on the side of the syringe. Once filled, carefully remove the syringe. Step 6: This next step is very important as it helps clear the nozzles so the cartridge can print. Using the small syringe with the plunger fully pushed in, insert the plunger into the fixing base and gently remove .5ml-1ml. For the HP 61 cartridge, we will be removing 1ml. Step 7: Remove the cartridge from the fixing base and wipe the outside with the tissue to remove any excess ink. Now that we've refilled the cartridge, install it into the printer and run a cleaning. Keep in mind that you will not be able to monitor the ink levels with a refilled cartridge, but you should get a comparable amount of prints to a new cartridge since you filled the cartridge to the same capacity. Refill Tips: Be sure to refill your cartridge before the ink is completely used. If your cartridge is completely empty when you attempt to refill, the nozzle may be damaged and the cartridge may be unusable. Always refill cartridges with correct amount of ink. Print quality will be affected if there is not enough ink in the cartridge. Remember to perform a printer cleaning before installing your refilled cartridge. LD Products sells a number of refill kits for HP and Canon printers. Make sure you buy the correct kit for your printer. The kits are not interchangeable, if you have the wrong kit, you won't be able to refill your cartridge. You can find a complete list of our kits in the description.

If you install the wrong ink cartridge in your printer, you will likely receive an error message on your printer display that prevents you from using the printer. Printers are smart and most will be able to tell right away if the wrong cartridge is installed. This is because of the chip on the side of the cartridge that communicates with the printer. Each chip is specially programmed to only work with a specific series of printers, so if you install your ink in the wrong printer, it immediately will not work. Do not try and force the cartridge into the printer. Printer cartridge chips and the contacts inside the printer are very sensitive and can easily be damaged if they are mishandled. A number of cartridges have similar sounding names, making it easy to accidentally buy and install the wrong product for your printer. It doesn't help that many cartridges look similar too! Even though cartridges appear similar, unfortunately, they are not interchangeable. The HP 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 and HP 67 series for example, all have a similar cartridge design but work in different printers. Remove their cartridge labels and it is hard to tell them apart! If you install an HP 65 in a printer that uses HP 64s, the printer will not operate. Bottom line, you need to be vigilant about what you buy before placing an order for a new set of ink. If you aren't familiar with the printer, double check the cartridge compatibility on the manufacturer's website, or check out the specs on LDProducts.com. When you install a cartridge, make sure it is installed in the corresponding color slot inside the printer. If you accidentally install the black cartridge in the color slot, you'll likely get a cartridge error on your printer display informing you of the mistake. Since most printer cartridges are outfitted with a unique chip that helps keep track of ink levels, the printer is able to tell that the wrong cartridge is installed and it won't print if the cartridges are mixed up.

It can be incredibly frustrating when your printer prevents you from printing black text just because one of your color cartridges is empty. Unfortunately, many new printers are designed to block you from printing if a cartridge is out of ink, forcing you to buy more ink at the least convenient time. However, there are some printer settings that may let you print for a short period before you put an order in for that new cartridge. Need to Print in Black? Change Your Printer Settings to "Grayscale" If you are looking to print black text, try changing your printer settings to "grayscale" or "black only". Grayscale often uses some combination of both the black and color inks to produce black text, but the color ink usage is nominal and you might be able to coerce a few more prints despite the empty cartridge message. How to adjust your printer settings in Windows: Pull up the printer menu, or hit "Control + P" on your keyboard Select printer properties The location of "draft mode" "economy mode" and "grayscale" varies depending on your printer. You may need to click around the printer settings menu to find it but it is typically located under the "Quality" or "Color Options" submenu. To start using it, just select your preferred mode, hit "OK" and start printing. How to adjust your printer settings on a Mac: Pull up the printer menu, or hit "Command (⌘)-P" on your keyboard Select your printer Select "show details" to change your printer settings to black and white and start printing Printing Color? Switch to the "Color Only" Setting If you are out of black ink and only want to print with the color cartridges, see if your printer has a "color only" setting. Not all printer models will have this option in their settings menu, but it is worth a look. HP printer owners have one last option! You can override the cartridge block on some HP printers by resetting the printer. This will change your printer it's original default settings, so if you have some printer setting preferences programmed on your printer, you are going to have reprogram them after the reset. On the printer control panel, select "Set up" or gear icon Select "Printer maintenance", then select "Restore" Select "Restore factory defaults", then select "Continue" Then change your printer settings to "Grayscale" and try printing again. If all else fails, you'll need to replace that empty cartridge to continue printing. Need new ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

Your printer will accept remanufactured cartridges and allow you to print the same number of pages as a name brand cartridge at much cheaper price. Savvy printer users have been saving money using remanufactured ink cartridges for decades and these low-cost alternatives are available for almost every printer model on the market. You'll notice quite a discrepancy in price between remanufactured printer cartridges compared to the name brand cartridges made by your printer manufacturer. Since many parts of the cartridge, including the plastic shell, are reused, the savings can be passed directly to the consumer. These savings can amount to as much as 70%, making it an ideal choice for consumers seeking a cost-effective solution to the most expensive aspect of an office supply budget. What is a remanufactured ink cartridge? A remanufactured ink cartridge is a name brand printer cartridge that has been used once and then been refurbished by a third-party printer cartridge supplier so it can be used again. The remanufacturing process is simple: after a cartridge has been recycled, it is professionally cleaned, tested and any worn out parts are replaced before refilled with comparable-quality ink. It is then performance tested again, and ready to be shipped off for reuse! The use of remanufactured ink and toner cartridges also promotes the conservation of resources. Generally, it takes five to nine pounds of materials to develop a new toner cartridge. Buying a remanufactured printer cartridge not only prevents an old cartridge from being irresponsibly discarded, but it also prevents a new one from being made, thus saving resources in the process. Are remanufactured ink cartridges just as good as the original? Yes, if choose a reputable third-party or aftermarket cartridge supplier. If you search for remanufactured cartridges online, you'll find a number of third-party cartridge suppliers for a range of affordable prices. With any secondary market that has been around for a long time, there is a lot of competition and varying degrees of quality. Generally, the cheaper the cartridge, the cheaper the print quality. To find a reputable cartridge supplier with a solid track record, look for one that is priced somewhere in the middle - in between the cheapest remanufactured cartridge price and the name brand cartridge price. Higher priced remanufactured cartridges typically use better quality parts than their lower end competitors and are filled with better quality ink too. You might see some claiming that the print quality just isn't as good as printing with the name brand. That may be the case for remanufactured cartridges on the cheaper end of the spectrum, however, if you are printing with a remanufactured cartridge from a trusted supplier, most consumers have a hard time telling the difference between a name brand print job and a remanufactured. Top-rated reviews from multiple review websites are also a great indicator of cartridge consistency, and of course, an iron-clad return policy is great too.

A printhead is a printing component that uses microscopic nozzles to spray ink onto the page. When one of these nozzles gets clogged your prints appear faded or streaky. Depending on what printer you own, the printhead will either be built into the cartridge or built into the printer. Cartridges with a built-in printhead are called integrated printer cartridges. These cartridges come in black and tri-color, which contains three color inks (cyan, magenta and yellow). With this type, the printhead nozzle is located on the side of the cartridge. A couple of examples are the HP 67 ink series and the Canon PG-245 / CL-246 ink series. One advantage of owning a printer that uses integrated printer cartridges is that you are essentially replacing the printhead every time you replace a cartridge, so you don't have to worry about your printhead deteriorating over time. Printers with a built-in printhead use individual ink cartridges, which look a little different than integrated cartridges. These cartridges typically come in black, cyan, magenta and yellow. If you have a specialty photo printer it may use additional cartridges like a photo black, photo cyan or photo magenta. Popular individual ink cartridge series include the HP 910 series and the Canon PGI-280 / CLI-281 ink series. With this type, the printhead is located inside the printer behind the cartridge installation area. Printers that use this kind of printhead will eventually wear out over an extended use and eventually need to be replaced. Since replacement printheads are so expensive, most consumers opt for buying a new printer rather than replacing the printhead. To ensure that your printhead stays in top shape for as long as possible, run a printhead cleaning regularly on your printer. This will help keep the nozzles clean and keep you printing longer.

The HP 67 is the standard yield version and is filled with less ink. The 67 black ink cartridge prints approximately 120 pages and 67 tri-color prints approximately 100 pages. The HP 67XL is the high yield version and the black cartridge prints approximately 240 pages, while the color version prints up to 240 pages. Whether you buy the standard yield or the high yield, the physical size of the cartridge is identical and the installation process is exactly the same. Standard yield cartridges and high yield cartridges can work together in your printer. For example, you could have a high yield black cartridge installed alongside a standard yield tri-color cartridge and would be able to print without any issues.

It does this by firing tiny droplets of ink via numerous printer nozzles to create a desired print. When one of these nozzles gets clogged your prints appear faded or streaky. The best time to run a printhead cleaning is when you start to get poor print results. A simple printhead cleaning will usually resolve any print quality issue right away and keep your cartridges primed for future prints. Most printers have a built in printhead cleaning function that can be found on your printer's display screen or the printer app that is available for your printer model. The cleaning process generally takes 1-2 minutes and most printers will ask if you want to print out a test page to confirm if the print quality has improved. If the print quality does not improve after running it the first time, we recommend running the printhead cleaning function 2-3 more times. Running a printhead cleaning uses a considerable amount of ink so if you still have quality issues after the third time, you either need to replace your cartridges or if your printhead is built into the printer, you can also try some further troubleshooting by manually cleaning the printhead. Printheads can either be a part of the printer cartridge or built into the printer - it all depends on what type of printer you own. If your printer only uses two ink cartridges (a black and tri-color cartridge) the printhead is built into the side of the cartridges, not the printer. This means whenever you replace the printer cartridges, you are also replacing the printhead, which is why a new set of cartridges will usually resolve your print quality issue if the cleaning function doesn't work. If your printer uses more than two cartridges, your printer uses individual ink cartridges that come in black, cyan, magenta and yellow. Some photo printers have additional cartridges like photo black, light magenta and light cyan too. These cartridges work with a separate, replaceable printhead that is built into the printer. With a little elbow grease you can usually remove the printhead from the printer and manually clean it with isopropyl alcohol to improve your print quality. Some printheads are easier to remove than others so be sure to do your research before you try to removing it from your printer. These kinds of printheads require replacement after long term use, however, since most printheads cost upwards of $100 and some can be hard to find, it usually cheaper to just buy a new printer. We provide more tips how to clean a printhead in our printhead cleaning guides below: How to Clean an HP Printhead How to Clean an Epson Printhead How to Clean a Canon Printhead We also recommend leaving your printer on and always plugged in if you are able. If you frequently turn off and unplug your printer, most printers are automatically programmed to run a printhead cleaning when they are plugged back in, which will slowly deplete your ink cartridges over time. To avoid unwanted automatic cleanings, you should be printing something at least once a month, even if it's just a short email. Need ink cartridges?

Here we breakdown some of the best ways to prevent ink smudging so you can print what you want without wasting pages on reprints. Wait for the Ink to Dry This may be an obvious solution but it's worth mentioning. Ink is primarily a liquid, so it needs time to dry. The kind of ink your printer uses, the type of paper you are printing on and the type of document you are printing all play a role in how long your printed page will take to dry. The more ink-heavy the print is, the more time it is going to take to dry. If you are printing multiple pages, separate them as they finish printing and let them sit for a time before stacking them. Know What Ink Type Your Printer Uses Printer ink is typically either dye-based or pigment-based, depending on what cartridge series your printer uses. You can find the ink type of your cartridges uses on the cartridge page of your printer manufacturer's website. Both cartridge types offer high quality text and color prints, but you may prefer one over the other, depending on what kind of printing you do. Dye-based inks are more economical and appreciated for their ability to produce vibrant, true to life color prints and photos. They are not waterproof like their pigment-based counterparts, and can be more susceptible to smudging, with many prints tending to fade after 25 years. Pigment-based ink offers a crisper finish and a quicker dry-time than dye-based ink. It is valued by professional photographers and graphic designers for its ability to print archival quality images and text. It also resists water and UV light better than dye-based ink and can resist fading for up to 200 years. It is often more expensive but lacks dye ink's brightness and broad color range. Choose the Right Paper You can find all kinds of printer paper and for good reason. Inkjet copy paper, laser copy paper, matte photo paper, glossy photo paper, ultra-glossy photo paper - if you've got a printer project, there is a paper type for it. Pairing the right paper with your printer can make all the difference in the world, especially when you are printing photos or professional looking business documents. Every printer has specific paper type recommendations. For example, the Epson Workforce Pro WF-3820 recommends 4 different photo paper types and each will give you different results depending on what you a printing. Consult your printer's user guide to see what paper types are recommended for your machine. Keep in mind, you don't always have to go with the name brand (LD Products has some great affordable paper options here). We suggest printing with a couple of different types to see what works best for your needs. Choose the Right Printer Settings The right paper settings are just as important as the right paper. Glossy photo paper, for example, should be paired with the glossy photo paper setting on your printer. To view all of the paper setting options on your printer go to the "Printer Properties" section of the print menu on your computer. Need ink cartridges?

In this guide, we show you how to speed up your printer with a few simple tips. Change the printer settings For the fastest print speed, print with basic copy paper and in draft mode. Draft mode is a printer setting that uses less ink when you print. The quality of a draft mode print job isn't as good as a normal print job but since less ink gets dispensed on the page, the printer will print faster. Move Your Printer Closer to Your Wireless Router Sometimes if your printer is far away from your router, it has to work harder to print. Check the wireless signal of your router on your computer. If the signal strength is low, move your computer and printer closer to the router. Reset the Printer With the printer turned on, unplug the power cord from the back of the printer and then unplug the printer from the wall for about a minute. Plug the printer back in, turn it back on and try printing again. Download the latest printer drivers The printer driver is the software that lets your printer communicate with your computer. When you are setting up your printer for the first time, you download the driver during the installation process. Over time, some drivers become outdated and need to be updated for your printer to remain at peak performance. To download the latest driver, first you will need to uninstall your current printer driver. Before you do this, make sure the printer is on and connected to the internet! We've included the instructions for Windows 10 below. Open the "add or remove" programs menu from the Windows search bar Find the printer driver you want to remove and click "Uninstall" Then go to the support page of your printer model to find the latest driver. This can be found just by searching for your "printer model number + "support" on Google. Here, you the latest driver update (the steps similar to setting up your printer for the first time) and follow the prompt to install. Then try printing again! Print with a USB cable If you are currently using Wi-Fi to print, try printing with a USB cable instead. A printer USB cable plugs into the back of the printer and the USB port on the side of your computer, providing a direct connection between printer and your laptop. This is a great alternative to printing wirelessly, especially if you struggle with a spotty wireless connection. The majority of printers are compatible with a USB 2.0 A/B cable, however, most new inkjet printers do not come with a USB cable these days since so many printer users opt to print wirelessly. You can still buy a USB cable should you want to use one, and they are pretty inexpensive too. We have a printer USB cable available for a great price here. Need new printer cartridges?

In this quick guide, we provide you with 5 tips that keep you printing longer for less. Switch to High Yield Cartridges Printer cartridges are often sold in three different capacities: standard yield, high yield, and extra high yield. The yield corresponds to the number of prints you are expected to get from a given cartridge. If you print a lot, go for the high yield or XL option. Higher yield cartridges are more expensive but are often worth the extra money because they last longer, which means less frequent replacements. Buy Compatible Printer Cartridges Reliable aftermarket suppliers of compatible printer ink not only offer a cost-effective alternative to big name brands, they can also provide you with cartridges that deliver a higher yield. However, not all aftermarket ink is created equal. Make sure you choose a company with tons of great reviews, a strong warranty and flexible return policy. This will serve as an indicator of that company's adherence to high standards of quality and customer service. LD Products has been a leader in the aftermarket industry for over twenty years and we stand by all of our remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges with a 100% satisfaction lifetime guarantee. If you are looking to save money on printer ink, we are a great choice! Print in draft mode Printers have different printer settings to manage the speed and quality of your prints. Each setting uses different amounts of ink. Draft mode uses the least amount of ink and is intended for short, less important prints like an email or even your kid's homework. To find the draft mode setting, simply go to the "Printer Properties" menu on the document that you are printing and select "Gray Scale" or "Draft Mode". Extend your cartridge life before buying replacement ink The dreaded "low ink message" is understandably frustrating but it doesn't always mean you have replace your ink right away. Before you invest in a new cartridge, try to extend the life of your existing cartridge. How to Extend the Life of an Ink Cartridge (Inkjet Printer Tips!) For inkjet printers, that means administering a printhead cleaning, which you can do directly on your printer display. Most printers have a built-in cleaning function that you can find under the settings or tools section of your printer's display screen. Consult your printer's manual to run the appropriate cleaning function, the cleaning process generally takes a couple of minutes. Once the cleaning is complete, check the printer test page print out to confirm if the print quality has improved. If you still have ink issues after running the cleaning on the display screen, you can also try the "paper towel" method if your printer uses an integrated cartridge. An integrated cartridge is an inkjet cartridge where the printhead is built into the side of the cartridge. We show you what an integrated cartridge looks like and the steps in the video below. Take a warm damp paper towel or coffee filter and blot the cartridge with the print heads facing down onto the paper towel to remove the dried ink on the print head. Then, taking a DRY paper towel or coffee filter, hold the cartridge down against the paper towel for 2-3 minutes. A dry paper towel will wick the ink out. Do not wipe the print head as this may cause damage How to Extend the Life of a Toner Cartridge (Laser Printer Tip) Is your laser printer creating spotty or streaky prints? Remove the toner cartridge from your printer and gently rock it back and forth over a trash can to redistribute the toner powder inside. Doing this should prime the cartridge and give you a few more prints before you need to pick up replacement! Limit color printing Color printing is the biggest offender when it comes to ink usage. To print in color less, switch your printer settings to "Black Ink Only" or "Gray Scale" and only print in color when it's absolutely necessary. Need new ink cartridges?

Recognition issues are common than you would think, even with OEM cartridges. Here, we cover a few simple troubleshooting tips that should get your cartridges working in just a few minutes! Clean the Cartridge Contact Chip Remove Any Protective Clips or Tape Reset the Printer Memory Perform a Hard Reset on the Printer Check the cartridge access area for obstructions Disable HP Cartridge Protection Contact the cartridge manufacturer! Clean the Cartridge Contact Chip More often than not, the root cause of most recognition errors is the gold contact chip on the side of the cartridge. This chip is the main line of communication between the printer and the cartridge and is very sensitive. When dust or fingerprint oil get on the chip it can cause a faulty reading on your printer. To clean the chip, follow these steps: Remove the cartridges from your printer Gently wipe the gold contact points with a lint-free cloth Reinstall your ink and try printing again Remove Any Protective Clips or Tape Before installing new ink, you need to remove any clips or tape that have been placed on the cartridge to protect it while it's in transit. Not all cartridges have a clip (it's usually orange and on the bottom of the cartridge), but most have a piece of tape that is covering the cartridge vent hole. If these components are not removed, an error message will appear on your printer display screen. We recommend removing everything over a trash can, as some ink can escape during this process. To remove the clip, hold the cartridge in one hand and gently pull up on the cartridge with the other hand. The protective tape is usually orange or yellow and all you have to do is peel it away from the cartridge to uncover the vent hole. Reset the Printer Memory If your printer's memory is full, it may have a hard time recognizing that a new cartridge installed. Sometimes all you need to do is "remind it" that you have installed new ink! To do this, you will need to have your old cartridges handy, so hopefully you have not discarded them just yet! Remove you new cartridges from the printer and reinstall your old cartridges Let the printer sit for about ten minutes with the old cartridges installed, then reinstall the new cartridges again and try printing again How to Reset Your Printer Another way to "remind" your printer that you are using new ink is by doing a hard reset on the printer. With the printer on, unplug the power cord from the printer and then unplug the power cord from the wall outlet. Wait for a minute, then plug the power cord back into the printer and the wall. The printer will reset and turn on, now you can try printing again. If your issue persists, you can also try resetting the printer to the default or factory settings. Most printers include an option to restore the printer to it's default settings in the "Tools" menu of the display. Check the cartridge access area for jammed paper or obstructions Like the contacts on the cartridge, the slot inside the printer where you install your ink is also sensitive. If any paper or other obstructions are in the cartridge access area or covering the cartridge slot, this can also cause a recognition error. Remove your cartridges from the printer and then use a flashlight to check the cartridge access area for any debris. Then, reinstall and try printing! Disable HP Cartridge Protection Some HP cartridges have HP cartridge protection embedded in the cartridge contact chip, which means the cartridge can only be used in the original printer that it was first installed in. If you try to use the cartridges in a different printer, you will get a "Protected HP Cartridge Installed" message on your printer display because the cartridges are locked to that first printer. To prevent your cartridges from being locked to a specific printer, you will need to turn off the HP cartridge protection setting on your printer. Open up the HP Smart app on your computer. Select "Printer Settings" on the HP Smart app menu Then select "Advanced Settings" > "Tools" >"Cartridge Settings" On the "Cartridge Settings" menu, scroll down to "Cartridge Protection", toggle it to "Off" and select" Apply" to save changes. Think you received a bad batch of ink? Contact the cartridge manufacturer! If you tried all these troubleshooting tips and are still getting a recognition error message, you likely have a bad cartridge and will need to get it replaced. Most name brand cartridges come with a limited warranty and can be replaced at no cost, but the replacement window varies depending on the manufacturer. If you ordered your ink from LD, we offer a LIFETIME guarantee on all our LD-brand cartridges, which means you are covered for the life of the cartridge.

Clean the gold contact chip on the printer cartridge Most error messages occur because the printer is having trouble reading the gold contact chip on the side the cartridge. This contact chip is the communication line between the cartridge and the printer and if your printer cannot read it, it doesn't know that the cartridge is installed. The easiest way to fix this is by cleaning the chip with a lint-free cloth and reinstalling the cartridge. 2. Perform a hard reset on the printer Sometimes your printer needs to be reminded that a new cartridge has been installed and a hard reset will trigger it's memory if cleaning the cartridge contacts doesn't work. Power down the printer and then unplug the power cord from the wall. Wait for a minute, then plug the printer back in and power it back up. Wait for the cartridges to center, and then try printing again. If your issue persists, you can also try resetting the printer to the default or factory settings. You can find factory reset specifics for your printer in your printer user guide. 3. Disable HP cartridge protection HP cartridge protection is a feature available on some HP printers that permanently assigns a printer cartridge to a specific printer. If this is enabled and you try to install a cartridge that has already been assigned to one printer into a different printer, the cartridge will not work. Once a cartridge has been "protected" you cannot revert it or turn off the protection, so be sure to disable the cartridge protection first before installing a new cartridge. How to Disable HP Cartridge Protection on the HP Smart App Launch the app, then go to the printer settings menu Go to "Advanced Settings" > "Tools" > "Cartridge Settings" Then select "Off" under the Cartridge Protection menu 4. Turn off automatic printer firmware updates If you are using a compatible or third-party ink cartridge, a firmware update may be preventing your cartridges from working. Firmware updates are software updates relating to your printer's functionality and sometimes printer manufacturers use them as a tool to block alternative brand ink cartridges from working in their printers. If you recently installed a firmware update on your printer and now your compatible cartridges are not working, the firmware update may be the cause. To get your cartridges working again, you will need to get a replacement cartridge with an updated chip that is compatible with the new firmware or look for a firmware downgrade solution that reverts the firmware and lets you use your existing cartridges. The process can vary slightly depending on the firmware update version, for example, a firmware downgrade solution will not be available for every update, but if you are having trouble and you purchased compatible cartridges from LD Products, just contact our customer service team and we will take care of you! We also suggest that all of our customers turn off the automatic firmware update settings on their HP printer. Turning off these updates lets you continue printing without the worry of a firmware update interrupting the use of your compatible cartridges. We show you how to turn off auto-updates in this article here. Need new ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

Many everyday printer users end up buying an inkjet printer over a laser printer because inkjets often have a much cheaper sticker price. However, when you compare the overall operating costs of an inkjet printer and a laser printer, a number of laser printers (and their toner cartridges) can actually end up saving you more money in the long term thanks to a lower cost per page. Cost per page is determined by the printer cartridge's page yield and the cost of a particular printer cartridge. Since toner cartridges are commonly used by busy businesses that print regularly, they have a much higher page yield, which gives you more prints per cartridge. Inkjets on the other hand have a lower page yield because of their smaller size and limited capacity, which leads to more frequent cartridge replacements throughout the life of your printer. Let's demonstrate by comparing operating costs of a popular inkjet printer and laser printer. The HP Deskjet 2655 All-in-One inkjet printer is less than a hundred dollars and uses the HP 65 black and tri-color ink cartridge series. The black cartridge prints 100 pages for $14.99 and the HP 65 tri-color cartridge prints up to 120 pages for $15.99. To calculate the cost per page of the black cartridge, just divide the page yield by the cartridge price: $14.99 / 100 = 14.9 cents To get the cost per page of the color cartridge, you'll need to add the black and color cost per page together. 14.9 cents + (15.99 / 120) = 28.9 cents The HP LaserJet Pro M180nw All-in-One laser printer we are comparing costs almost three times as much as the HP Deskjet. Cartridge costs are pricier too but the operating cost is low. This printer uses the HP 204A black, cyan, magenta and yellow toner cartridges. The black cartridge costs $50.99 and prints 1,100 pages while each color cartridge costs $56.99 and prints 900 pages apiece. Let's do the same math for these cartridges to examine the printer's cost per page: Again, we will divide the page yield by the cartridge price for the black cartridge: $50.99 / 1,100 = 4.6 cents per page And we will add the black and color cost per page together to calculate the operating costs of the color cartridges: ($50.99 / 1,100) + (($56.99 / 900) x 3) = 23.5 cents per page As you can see, the toner cartridges are actually more efficient to operate when you break down the overall cost per page. Not only do you get more prints per cartridge but you get a better printing value too! That $50.00 price tag for a toner cartridge may look a little unnerving at first, but if you wanted to print the same number of pages with the inkjet, you'd be spending around $165 on 11 HP 65 black ink cartridges, so there is a big savings there as well! Bottom line, compare the cost per page across printer models to figure out if the laser printer you are considering is more cost effective than an inkjet printer. If you print a lot, it may make sense to pay more upfront the laser printer because your printing costs are far more efficient long term. Keep in mind, cartridge costs and cartridge page yields vary greatly from printer to printer! Now that you know how to calculate cost per page you can make an educated decision the next time you are shopping for a new machine. You can save even more printing with LD brand compatible cartridges too. Available at a fraction of the price of the original, you get the same number of prints and the same great print quality at an unbelievable value! *Savings based on price comparison between remanufactured/compatible cartridge prices on www.LDProducts.com and OEM cartridge and printer prices from Staples.

For most home and office printers, the average lifespan is around 5 years, but to really figure out your operating costs, you are going to want to look at your printer's cost per page. Let's look at the Canon PIXMA TS3320 printer as an example: Printer Price First, consider the printer price. As of December 2021, this printer is retailing for less than $80*. This is pretty inexpensive for an inkjet printer. Most printer manufacturers don't mind selling you a cheap printer because they know you need to buy ink later down the road, and this where they make a lot of their money. Generally, cheaper printers use cartridges that are not very ink efficient, which means your printer will run out of ink faster and you will need to replace your cartridges more often. Page Yield & Cartridge Price Next, look the page yield and the cost of the printer cartridges. Page yield is the approximate number of pages that your cartridge can print. Every cartridge series has a different page yield, some low yield ink cartridges can only print up to 100 pages, while some heavy duty toner cartridges can print more than 10,000 pages. Pricing for different yield cartridges can vary greatly from brand to brand. Every printer manufacturer has their own reasons for charging a certain price and using a certain cartridge series in a particular printer, but no matter what cartridges your printer uses, they all follow the same ISO page yield standards. The international standard for organization (ISO), is an independent international body that develops industry standards for products. ISO page yield standards for the printing industry were established in the early 2000s as a way for consumers to reliably measure and compare cartridge page yield across printer manufacturers. With all major printer manufacturers held to the same testing and reliability standards, consumers can compare competing products and make an informed purchasing decision. ISO standards have determined that the page yield of a cartridge is based on printing out pages with 5% page coverage until the cartridge runs empty. 5% page coverage is comparable to printing out a short email, so if your cartridge has a yield of 100 pages, it can print out approximately 100 short emails. Since everyone has different printing habits, the actual page yield can vary from user to user. Other factors, like the type of document you are printing and the print quality setting can also affect the yield. If you are printing a full page of text or color photos, you are using a lot more ink and the number of prints you get out of the cartridge will be significantly less. The Canon PIXMA TS3320 uses two cartridges, the Canon PG-243 black and CL-244 tri-color standard yield cartridges, a high yield PG-245 black / CL-246 color option and an extra high yield PG-245XL / CL-246XL size. The higher yield options are generally more expensive because it is filled with more ink but it is a better long term value if you print often. As you can see in our page yield breakdown below, the Canon PG-243 / CL-244 series do not print very many pages and will need to be replaced frequently if you print a lot (which means your printer operating costs will add up fast!). Cartridge Series Cost Page Yield CPP Canon PG-243 Black $15.99 100 15 cents Canon CL-244 Tri-Color $20.99 100 35 cents Canon PG-245 Black $17.99 180 9.9 cents Canon CL-246 Tri-Color $22.99 180 22.6 cents Canon PG-245XL Black $25.99 300 8.6 cents Canon CL-246XL Tri-Color $29.99 300 18.5 cents Cost per Page Cost per page determines approximately how much you are going to be spending on each printed page. Calculating this is straightforward, just divide the cartridge's page yield by the cost of the printer cartridge. Canon PG-243 Black Cost per Page Cartridge cost / page yield = cost per page $15.99 / 100 = .1599, or 15 cents per page Calculating the color cost per page is slightly different because you need to factor the black cartridge cost per page into the total since both cartridges work together to create a print. Let's start by doing the math on the color cartridge... Canon CL-244 Color Cost per Page Cartridge cost / page yield = cost per page $20.99 / 100 = .2099, or 20 cents per page Then add the 20 cents (color CPP) + 15 cents (black CPP) to get our actual CPP of the color cartridge, which is 35 cents. Now that we know what the average cost per page is for these cartridges, we can confirm that operating costs for the Canon PIXMA TS3320 are pretty high. If you are looking to lower your printer operating costs you are going to want to find a printer that uses cartridges with a higher page yield and less expensive printer cartridges. To save even more money, consider printing with LD-Brand compatible printer cartridges from LD Products. LD cartridges offer the same yield as the original brand for a fraction of the cost, so you can print affordably without sacrificing page yield or print quality.

Perform a hard reset A simple hard reset of your printer is the easiest way to troubleshoot any offline status or connectivity issues. Power down the printer and then unplug the power cord from the printer and the wall. Wait for a minute, then plug the printer back in. The printer will reset and turn on. Wait for the cartridges to center, and then try printing again. Check the Power Source and Wireless Connection This is an obvious one, but it's always worth mentioning. Double check that all of the cables are connected to the appropriate power source - that means the wall outlet, your laptop and if your printer is using a USB cable, that too! If your printer is connected to WiFi or Bluetooth, is the printer on the same network as your laptop? You can check the wireless settings directly on your printer display screen by selecting the wireless icon. Then go into the wi-fi setting menu to view and confirm the connection and network name. Run the Printer Troubleshooter 1. Search for "Settings" in the Windows start menu to bring up the Windows Settings menu then click on "System" 2. Type in "troubleshoot" in the System search bar to bring up the Troubleshoot settings menu 3. Then select "Additional Troubleshooting" 4. Select "Printer" 5. The program will scan for problems 6. Select your printer model and run the troubleshooter. If an issue is discovered, the troubleshooter will try to repair the problem. Change the Printer Status Search for "Printers & scanners" on the Windows start menu > select your printer > open the printer menu. If "use printer offline" is checked, uncheck it and then try printing again. Need ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

In this guide, we show you how to remove the feature lock message from your display so you can turn off updates* and keep printing with your compatible cartridges, without worrying about firmware interruptions! Follow these 3 steps to remove the lock message and turn off your updates: Step 1: Restore the Printer to Factory Default Settings Restoring the printer to it's factory default settings will reset the printer to it's original state. Doing this should clear the lock message from the printer display. Step 2: Confirm that Firmware Updates are Turned Off With your printer reset to the factory default settings, the feature lock message should be cleared from your printer display screen and you should now be able to access the settings in the "Printer Update Options" menu to turn off firmware updates. You can confirm that the message has been removed by navigating to the "Update the Printer" menu. "Printer Update Options" should now be set to OFF, which means firmware updates are now disabled on your printer. If you want to double check and confirm that updates are off, select "Do Not Check" on the next screen and then "No" to turn the updates off. Then you can proceed to step 3 to reconnect your Wi-Fi. Step 3: Reconnect Printer to Wi-Fi After resetting your printer, you may need to reconnect your printer to Wi-Fi. You can tell that your printer needs to be reconnected to Wi-Fi by looking at the small wireless icon on the top of the display screen. If there is a small orange triangle with an exclamation point inside of it, that means your Wi-Fi is not connected. There are a few ways you can do this but we have found the easiest way is to connect to it directly from the printer display screen by selecting your wireless network and typing in your Wi-Fi- password. After your printer is reconnected, you can print again. *Reverting your printer firmware may affect other functionality. Please see your printer support page for more details.

Cartridges can be stored anywhere between 5 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but try to avoid extreme temperatures! An open cartridge will eventually dry out if it is not used regularly. Most new cartridges are covered part way by a plastic clip. This clip protects the cartridge while it is in transit and it should be removed before you install the cartridge in your printer. It is also common for most ink cartridges to have a piece of tape covering the gold contacts on the cartridge. You will need to remove this piece of tape before installing. We recommend removing it over a trash can, as some ink may escape from the cartridge when you are doing this. If you install the cartridge and automatically get an error message, try cleaning the gold and copper dots on the end of the cartridge with a lint-free cloth. Sometimes residue or fingerprint oil can get on these connection points and cause an error in the printer. Try to use your cartridges a couple of times a week, even if you are printing something as simple as a short email. This will keep them primed and prevent them from clogging. How to Handle Toner Cartridges: Keep the cartridge in its original packaging until you need to install it. Cartridges can be stored anywhere between 5 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, but try to avoid extreme temperatures! An open cartridge will eventually dry out if it is not used regularly. Keep the toner in the horizontal position at all times. If you keep it stored on it's side the toner powder will shift and may cause print problems when you install it. Most toners include a pull tab or piece of tape on the end of the cartridge. This will need to be completely removed from the tone before installation. The piece of tape should pull all the way out the cartridge in one long strip. We recommend pulling the tape over a trash can, as some toner powder will likely escape from the cartridge during this process. If your toner has a built-in drum, a protective clip will likely be covering the drum when you open up the new cartridge. Be sure to remove this clip before installation. Try to avoid touching the drum when you install the cartridge, as it is very sensitive. If you accidentally touch the drum with your fingers, gently wipe it down with a lint-free cloth before installation. Gently rock the toner cartridge back and forth a couple of times over a trash can before installing the cartridge for the first time. This will prime the cartridge for the printer.

This error message is usually the result of a cartridge that is not firmly seated in its designated slot. To troubleshoot the problem, begin by completely removing the cartridge from its port. Reinstall the cartridge by positioning it so that it snaps into place and is securely fastened in its slot. Keep in mind that your printer doesn't actually read the amount of ink in the cartridge. Printer software simply estimates the amount of ink remaining in the cartridge by remembering the number of pages that were printed when the previous cartridge was installed, and using this information to estimate when your next cartridge should be replaced. If a new cartridge is installed before the printer driver resets, there is a chance that the printer may think that the old empty cartridge is still being used. To fix the issue, reinstall the cartridge and click on the install new cartridge option; you may have to refer to your printer's manual for further instructions. Selecting the new cartridge option will indicate to your printer that a new cartridge has been installed which will then prompt it to reset the page counter. This should eliminate the error message.

Many people ask if these cartridges can be used interchangeably, or if your printer will work if one of the cartridges is installed and not the other. The short answer is, no. If your printer requires both types of cartridges, you will need them both for the machine to work properly. The main difference between the two is the type of ink that's inside the cartridge. A regular black ink cartridge uses pigment based ink, and is typically used to print black and white text. A photo black ink cartridge is designed specifically for photo printing. It uses a dye based ink, which helps produce more defined shades of black when printing a photo. Many HP photo printers, like the HP Photosmart 7510, require both a black and photo black cartridge. If your inkjet printer has 5 cartridge slots, there is a good chance it requires black cartridge and a photo black cartridge. Make sure to double check your printer manual before you go out and buy a cartridge you won't need. HP photo black cartridges include a small camera icon on the box for easy reference.

Here, we show you how to bypass the error message so you can keep printing with your compatible Canon cartridges. If you are getting a message that says "used genuine Canon ink tanks were detected" select "OK" on the display. After "OK" is selected, you can continue to print with these cartridges until they are depleted. This message will not keep you from printing with compatibles. If an exclamation mark appears on the display screen, continue to use the cartridges until an "X" appears on the display screen or until the cartridges are fully depleted. This exclamation mark is warning to let you know it's almost time to replace your ink cartridges, but they do not need to be replaced immediately. If you are getting a message that says a cartridge cannot be recognized, try removing and reinstalling the cartridges. Before you reinstall the cartridge you can clean the gold contact points on the end of the cartridge with a lint-free cloth. These points can get dust or fingerprint oil on them that sometimes causes a faulty reading in the printer. You can also try resetting the printer. With the cartridges installed, power down the printer and unplug it from the wall for about a minute. Then, plug it back in, turn it on and try printing again. If you still have issues after these troubleshooting steps you may have a faulty printer cartridge and it will need to be replaced.

Make a note of which cartridge need to be replace, press the "OK" button and then press "1". 3. If you want to replace a cartridge before that message appears, you can! Just press the "menu" button and then use the arrow buttons to select "Maintenance". Then select "Ink Cartridge Replacement" and press the "OK" button. 4. Lift up the scanner unit and wait for the cartridges to stop moving. 3. Gently pull out the cartridge and pull up to remove it from the printer. 4. Open up the new cartridge over a trash can. Sometimes ink can escape from the cartridge during this process, which is why we recommend the trash can! 5. Remove the yellow tape on the cartridge. This will expose the vent hole on the side of the cartridge, which allows it to function properly inside the printer 6. While you are opening the cartridge, be careful not to touch the gold contact points on the side of the cartridge. These contacts are very sensitive and if you accidentally touch them with your fingers or if dust gets on them, you may get a faulty reading on your printer display. If you do accidentally touch the contacts you can wipe them with a lint-free cloth. 7. Install the new cartridge into the correct cartridge slot and push down until it clicks into place. 8. Lower the scanner unit. and select the "OK" button. 9. The printer will initialize for a few moments and then you can start printing!

First, double check to make sure you have the correct toner installed. Reference your printer's user guide to confirm whether your cartridge model number is appropriate for your printer. If you have a color laser printer, make sure the cartridge is installed in the correct color slot. If a toner error message is preventing your cartridge from working, you may need to clean the contact or chip on the end of the cartridge. Most toners come equipped with a small chip on one end of the cartridge that communicates with the printer once it installed. Occasionally dust or fingerprint oil can get on that chip and cause an error in your printer. To clean the chip, gently wipe it with a lint-free cloth and reinsert the cartridge into your printer. This will likely resolve the error message. If the error message persists, try resetting your printer and shutting it off for a few minutes. Then, power it back up and try to install the toner again. Should you have any other issues with your toner, get in touch our customer service team, we would be happy to walk you through the troubleshooting process. Looking to lower your printing costs?

We walk you through the process below using an Epson WorkForce WF-3820, but the steps are similar no matter which printer you are using. Just consult you printer's user guide for your machine's specific steps. How to Print a Diagnostic Page with an Epson Workforce Pro WF-3820 Swipe right on the printer display to access the maintenance menu Select "Maintenance, then select "Printhead Nozzle Check" Select "Print" and it will go through the printing process to print out a diagnostic page. If the lines of a particular color are spotty or missing, this is the problem cartridge. Select the red "X" to confirm that there is a print quality issue with one of the cartridges and the printer will prompt you to run a printhead cleaning. How to Run a Printhead Cleaning on the Epson Workforce Pro WF-3820 Select "Start" to begin the cleaning, which takes about 2 minutes. When the cleaning is complete you can choose to print out a new diagnostic page to check if the print quality issue was resolved. If the color is still not coming through, let the printer sit for about 10 minutes before running a second cleaning, this allows the ink to soak on the printhead. It might take a couple of cleanings to get a cartridge properly primed, especially if the printer has been sitting for a while. If you run a couple of cleanings without any success, it may be a faulty cartridge. Faulty cartridges are rare, but they do happen from time to time. Try printing with a new cartridge and compare results. If the cartridge is the culprit, look into the manufacturer's guarantee about a replacement. All LD brand cartridges are backed by a lifetime guarantee, so if you have the LD brand, you are covered!

Most cartridges have an orange or yellow piece of tape that covers the vent hole during transit. This tape must be removed before you print. If you install the cartridge with the tape still attached, ink will not dispense from the cartridge, giving you a blank page. Some ink can escape from the cartridge when you remove the tape. We recommend removing it over a trashcan to prevent a potential mess. To remove, gently pull the tape away from the cartridge. If you remove the tape and still are not getting prints, try these troubleshooting steps: The "paper towel" method The "paper towel" method only works on integrated ink cartridges, or a cartridge that has the printhead built into the cartridge itself. This process primes the printhead and can usually get a cartridge to start printing right away. See an example of integrated ink cartridge in our troubleshooting video below: To start, grab a warm, damp paper towel and a dry paper towel. Take the warm, damp paper towel and blot the cartridge with the printhead side down onto the towel. You should see ink appearing on the paper towel after blotting a couple of times. Be careful not to confuse the printhead with the gold and copper contacts or dots. After blotting onto the damp paper towel, hold the cartridge against the dry paper towel for 30 seconds to a minute. This process wicks out any dried ink that may be preventing you from a quality print. Once complete, insert the cartridge back in the machine and run a test print. Repeat the process a couple of times for best results. If the second time doesn't improve the situation, try our next tip, printhead cleaning. Run a printhead cleaning Most printers have a built in cleaning function. This is the easiest way to solve a clogged printhead problem. Consult your printer's manual to run the appropriate cleaning function, you can usually find the cleaning feature under the "maintenance" or "settings" section of your printer's menu. The cleaning process generally takes a couple of minutes. Once it is completed, print a diagnostic page. If the test pattern is crisp, you are ready to print! If the quality is still poor, let the printer sit for about 10 minutes before running a second cleaning, this allows the ink to soak on the printhead. It might take a couple of cleanings to get a cartridge properly primed, especially if the printer has been sitting for a while. We walk you through the process below using an Epson WorkForce WF-3820, but the steps are similar no matter which printer you are using.

If you own a Brother laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your Brother MFC-7240 display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have.

Open the front cover and let the printer sit for ten minutes so it can cool down. Remove the drum unit and toner cartridge from the printer. Separate the toner cartridge from the drum unit by pressing down on the green lever. Open up your new drum unit. Slide the toner cartridge into the drum unit so it locks into place.

If you own a Brother laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your Brother Intellifax 2840 display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother Intellifax 2840. This printer works with Brother TN-420 and TN-450 toner cartridges and the DR-420 drum unit. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: Turn on the printer. Open the front cover and let the printer sit for ten minutes so it can cool down. Remove the drum unit and toner cartridge from the printer. Separate the toner cartridge from the drum unit by pressing down on the green lever. Open up your new drum unit. Slide the toner cartridge into the drum unit so it locks into place. You should hear a click! Clean the corona wire by sliding the green tab on the drum unit back and forth a couple of times. This preps the drum unit before use. Install the toner cartridge and drum unit together as one piece back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter. How to reset the drum counter: Make sure the printer is on, then open the front cover and push "clear" button. Press "1" to confirm you are installing a new drum. When the screen says "Accepted", close the front cover and you can now start printing!

If you own a Brother laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your Brother HL-2240 display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother HL-2240. This printer works with Brother TN-420 and TN-450 toner cartridges and the DR-420 drum unit. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: Turn on the printer. Open the front cover and let the printer sit for ten minutes so it can cool down. Remove the drum unit and toner cartridge from the printer. Separate the toner cartridge from the drum unit by pressing down on the green lever. Open up your new drum unit. Slide the toner cartridge into the drum unit so it locks into place. You should hear a click! Clean the corona wire by sliding the green tab on the drum unit back and forth a couple of times. This preps the drum unit before use. Install the toner cartridge and drum unit together as one piece back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter. How to reset the drum counter: Make sure the machine is on, then open the front cover. Press and hold the "Go" button for about 4 seconds or until all the LEDs light up. Release the "Go" button and close the front cover. If the drum light is off, the drum unit is reset.

Cartridges are typically kept flat or upside down for weeks or months before being used.

The easiest remedy for this is to open the box and stand the cartridge upside down for a few minutes before using. Next, get a damp paper towel, fold it into quarters and the set cartridge print head down onto it, holding it there for three minutes. This will help to prime the print head and pull the ink out.

We recommend opening up any new cartridge and removing the tape over a trashcan. Sometimes a bit of ink or toner will escape from the cartridge when you preparing the cartridge for the printer. Ink cartridges: The tape on an ink cartridge covers the vent hole on the cartridge. If you install the cartridge with the tape still attached, the cartridge will not be able to print. The tape is typically found on the top of the cartridge and is usually a yellow or orange color. To remove, gently pull the tape away from the cartridge. It should easily detach from the cartridge.

There are two types of inkjet printheads you should be aware of, an integrated printhead and a printhead that is built into the printer. An integrated printhead is a printhead that is built into the ink cartridge itself. These printheads are considered disposable printheads as they are disposed along with the used ink cartridge when the ink cartridge is replaced. Cartridges with integrated printheads usually more expensive than a cartridge that doesn't have an integrated printhead. For cartridges that are ink tanks the printhead is separate from the ink tank itself. The printhead may be permanently installed in the printer itself or can be a replaceable maintenance item. Ink tanks are generally less expensive than ink cartridges with the printhead integrated. With the printheads separated the colors can also be split into individual ink tanks allowing only the color that is depleted to be replaced rather than the entire cartridge as in the case of a tri-color cartridge. First, try a printhead cleaning: Most printers have a built in cleaning function that you can find under the settings or tools section of your printer's display screen. This is the easiest way to solve a clogged printhead problem. Consult your printer's manual to run the appropriate cleaning function, the cleaning process generally takes a couple of minutes. We walk you through the process with an Epson WF-3820 printer in the video below. These steps are similar for most printer models. We've also included the basic steps for the HP OffiiceJet 8015 directly after the video. For this HP Officejet 8015 printer, the "Clean Printhead" option is under the "Printer Maintenance" menu of the display screen: Once it is completed, print a diagnostic page or printer quality report. For the HP Officejet 8015 printer, the "Print Quality Report" option is under the "Reports" menu of the display screen. If the test pattern is crisp, you are ready to print! If the quality is still poor, let the printer sit for about 10 minutes before running a second cleaning, this allows the ink to soak on the printhead. It might take a couple of cleanings to get a cartridge properly primed, especially if the printer has been sitting for a while. If your printer uses cartridges with an integrated printhead, you can also try the "paper towel method": Take a warm damp paper towel or coffee filter and blot the cartridge with the print heads facing down onto the paper towel to remove the dried ink on the print head. Then, taking a DRY paper towel or coffee filter, hold the cartridge down against the paper towel for 2-3 minutes. A dry paper towel will wick the ink out.

The proper steps for unclogging a printhead vary depending on the sort of printer you own. Printheads can either be built into the printer, or be a part of the cartridge. Printers with a fixed printhead in the machine will have to be replaced over continued use, and cartridges that have a printhead built-in, are replaced every time you buy a new cartridge. Many HP ink cartridges, like the HP 65 series for example, are integrated printhead cartridges where a printhead is built into each cartridge. Individual ink cartridges like the Brother LC203 series, function with a printhead that is built into the printer. These cartridges are often smaller than an integrated cartridge and are typically equipped with a small chip to monitor ink levels. Troubleshooting Integrated Ink Cartridges The first way to troubleshoot a clogged printhead is with the paper towel method. To start you will need to have a damp paper towel and a dry paper towel at the ready. Take the warm, damp paper towel and blot the cartridge with the printhead side down onto the towel. The printhead is located on the end of the cartridge where the ink comes out and is typically a gold or copper strip. You should see ink appearing on the paper towel after blotting a couple of times. Be careful not to confuse the printhead with the gold and copper contacts or dots. After blotting onto the damp paper towel, hold the cartridge against the dry paper towel for 30 seconds to a minute. This process wicks out any dried ink that may be preventing you from a quality print. Once complete, slide the cartridge back in the machine and run a test print. If you still have trouble, repeat the process again. If the second time doesn't still gives you trouble, try our second tip, printhead cleaning. Most printers come equipped with a cleaning function built into the machine. Cleaning functions are usually found under the "Tools" menu of your printer's display. A printhead cleaning takes 2 or 3 minutes. Once it is complete, print out a test page to compare print quality. If the quality is still poor, try running a second cleaning. If you run the second cleaning and still have trouble, it may time to get a new ink cartridge. Running multiple cleanings in a row will quickly deplete the ink in your cartridge, and it is not recommended. We walk you through the process with an Epson WF-3820 printer in the video below. These steps are similar for most printer models. Consult your printer's user guide to find the appropriate steps for your printer. Troubleshooting Individual Ink Cartridges Since individual ink cartridges work with the printhead that is built into the printer, you will not be able to attempt the paper towel method on them. Your best troubleshooting option is the aforementioned cleaning function that you will find on your printer's display. If you are getting an error message that says "Printhead Problem" or "Printhead Appears to be Missing or Damaged" it might be a signal that it is time to replace your printhead. Replacing a printhead can get expensive, so be sure to weight your options before you buy. Sometimes it can be cheaper to buy an entirely new printer instead of a single printhead.

Learn how to run the HP cleaning function here. If you tried running the HP printer cleaning function on your printer and are still getting poor print results, you can try manually cleaning the printhead. The steps below only work for printers that have a removeable printhead inside the printer. Some printers that have a removeable printhead include the HP OfficeJet 8710, OfficeJet 8720, OfficeJet 9015 and OfficeJet 9025. Supplies need: a plastic container, a couple of dry paper towels, a lint-free cloth and filtered or distilled hot water. Fold the dry paper towel into quarters and place it in the plastic container Pour about two inches of hot water on top of the paper towel so that it is completely submerged Open up the printer and remove all of the ink cartridges from the machine Set the cartridges aside on a separate paper towel while you continue the printhead cleaning process. Make sure the cartridges are facing up on the paper towel. Lift up on the gray latch behind the cartridge carriage that holds the cartridges. This will release the printhead from the printer. Pull the printhead up and out to remove it from the machine. Dampen the lint-free cloth with hot water. Gently wipe away an excess ink on the printhead nozzle. Place the printhead in the container with the submerged paper towels. The nozzle should be facing down. Be careful not to touch the nozzle as it can be damaged easily. Let the printhead soak for about ten minutes. Then remove it from the container and set it on a dry paper towel to dry for fifteen minutes. The nozzle should be facing up. Reinstall the printhead back into the printer. Don't forget to secure the latch! Then reinstall the cartridges and run the cleaning function on the machine again.

If you own a MFC-L2705DW laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your machine's display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother MFC-L2705DW. This printer works with Brother TN-630 and TN-660 toner cartridges and the DR-630 drum unit. If you are in need of a new drum, you can save money with the LD-brand compatible DR-630 drum here. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: 1. Turn on the printer. 2. Open the front cover and let the printer sit for ten minutes so it can cool down. 3. Remove the drum unit and toner cartridge from the printer. 4. Separate the toner cartridge from the drum unit by pressing down on the green lever. 5. Open up your new drum unit. 6. Slide the toner cartridge into the drum unit so it locks into place. You should hear a click! 7. Clean the corona wire by sliding the green tab on the drum unit back and forth a couple of times. This preps the drum unit before use. 8. Install the toner cartridge and drum unit together as one piece back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter.

If you own a HL-L2320D laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your machine's display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother HL-L2320D. This printer works with Brother TN-630 and TN-660 toner cartridges and the DR-630 drum unit. If you are in need of a new drum, you can save money with the LD-brand compatible DR-630 drum here. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: 1. Turn on the printer. 2. Open the front cover and let the printer sit for ten minutes so it can cool down. 3. Remove the drum unit and toner cartridge from the printer. 4. Separate the toner cartridge from the drum unit by pressing down on the green lever. 5. Open up your new drum unit. 6. Slide the toner cartridge into the drum unit so it locks into place. You should hear a click! 7. Clean the corona wire by sliding the green tab on the drum unit back and forth a couple of times. This preps the drum unit before use. 8. Install the toner cartridge and drum unit together as one piece back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter.

In our example we will be offering troubleshooting tips for the Brother HL-L8350CDW printer, but most Brother printers follow the same general troubleshooting rules. Consult your printer's user guide for specific troubleshooting instructions for your machine. Remove the toner and gently shake it back and forth over a trashcan to redistribute the toner powder and then put it back into the machine. Gently wipe the scanner windows with a lint-free cloth. Run a test print to see if quality improves. If you are still getting poor print results after troubleshooting the toner, you can also troubleshoot the drum unit, which is a separate consumable. Gently slide the blue corona wire tab back and forth from left to right 8-10 times. Check the surface of the drum for any dust or debris. Wipe the exposed part of the drum with a lint-free cloth.

Press the "OK" button to select "Drum" and then select the "down" button to reset the drum counter.

This downgrade will revert your firmware to version 1847A. If you have a different HP printer, you will need to find a different installer for your printer series in order to revert the firmware. 1. Download and run the installer for the previous version of the firmware update. Please make sure you select the correct version of the installer for your specific printer series. Download the downgrade software for your specific HP printer here 2. Before downgrading your firmware, make sure that you have the automatic firmware updates turned off. Turning off these updates will also protect your cartridges from potentially being affected by future firmware updates. We show you how to turn off firmware updates here 3. Make sure your printer is connected to the computer with a USB cable, then open the firmware downgrade software. In this example, we will show you the steps with an HP OfficeJet Pro 8710 printer. 4. After the software is detected, an update notification will appear on your screen that lists the current version of your printer firmware 5. Select the printer that you would like to downgrade and click "Update" 6. These notifications will appear on your computer as the printer goes through the downgrade process. 7. When the downgrade is complete, select "OK" 8. The previous firmware version will appear on your computer and read "Update Successful". Select "Exit" to end the set up. You can now continue printing with your cartridges! *Reverting your printer firmware may affect other functionality. Please see your printer support page for more details.

On the printer control panel, swipe down to open the dashboard, then select the set up icon 2. Swipe up on the display and then select "Printer Maintenance" 3. Select "Clean Printhead" and then select "Continue" If the print quality does not improve on the test page, try running the cleaning a second time or third time, if necessary.

A print quality diagnostic report is basically a test page that will give you clear idea of how each specific cartridge is performing. We will be using an HP Officejet 6600 as our example. If you own a different printer, be sure to consult your printer's user guide for specific instructions. 1. Touch the right arrow button on the printer's display 2. Then, touch "Setup" 3. And then select, "Reports" 4. Then, select "Print Quality Report" If the print quality looks poor or you are missing color bars it may be time to replace the spotty cartridge. Before you run out and buy a new cartridge, you should first try running a printhead cleaning, there is a good chance it could clear up the issue right away. To clean the printhead from your printer's display on your HP OfficeJet 6600, follow these instructions: 1. Touch the right arrow button. 2. Then, touch "Setup" 3. And then, select "Tools" 4. Then touch "Clean Printhead" The cleaning process should take around two minutes to complete. Once it is done, you can try running another print quality diagnostic test and compare results. If the quality is still poor, try running a second printhead cleaning. We don't recommend running more than 2 or 3 printhead cleanings because it can deplete your ink cartridges quite a bit. If you run a couple of cleanings without any improvement, it might be time to replace your ink cartridge. Looking to lower your printing costs?

A print quality diagnostic report is basically a test page that will give you clear idea of how each specific cartridge is performing. We will be using an HP Officejet 8610 as our example. If you own a different printer, be sure to consult your printer's user guide for specific instructions. 1. Touch the "Setup" button on the printer's display. 2. Then, touch "Print Reports" 3. And then select, "Print Quality Report". If the print quality looks poor or you are missing color bars it may be time to replace the spotty cartridge. Before you run out and buy a new cartridge, you should first try running a printhead cleaning, there is a good chance it could clear up the issue right away. To clean the printhead from your printer's display on your HP OfficeJet 8610, follow these instructions: 1. Touch the "Setup" button. 2. Then, touch "Tools" 3. And then, select "Clean Printhead". The cleaning process should take around two minutes to complete. Once it is done, you can try running another print quality diagnostic test and compare results. If the quality is still poor, try running a second printhead cleaning. We don't recommend running more than 2 or 3 printhead cleanings because it can deplete your ink cartridges quite a bit. If you run a couple of cleanings without any improvement, it might be time to replace your ink cartridge. Looking to lower your printing costs?

Many HP cartridges, as well as some other manufacturers, have a long sku, a short part number and, sometimes, even an alternative part number. For example, HP's #56 cartridge is also known as the 56A C6656, C6656A and C6656AN. These are all the same product and have the same ink volume, but are displayed using various shortened versions of the full part number, which is C6656AN. Most HP cartridges are available with different ink volumes. HP cartridges with different ink volumes are identified by a different letter at the end of the number sequence. For example, HP cartridge 51645G and 51645A are identical cartridges, but have different ink volumes. The "G" is the free starter cartridge that comes with a printer and the "A" is the regular high volume cartridge that is sold in stores. When our house-brand cartridges are manufactured, they are always filled completely. So, regardless of the letter at the end of the HP part number, or the letter at the end of the HP cartridge that you normally order, you will always get a cartridge with a high-ink volume from LD.

After you downgrade the printer to the previous version, you can continue to print with your compatible Epson cartridges. The following instructions work for Epson Expression XP-330, XP-340, XP-430, XP-434, XP-440, and XP-446 series printers. If you have a different Epson printer, you will need to find a different installer for your printer series in order to revert the firmware. Turn off the printer. While the printer is off, press and hold the "home" "power" "left arrow" and "cancel" buttons at the same time until the ROM menu appears on your printer's display.

Click "Start" Let the program run until the pop up displays "Finish". When it is complete, click "Finish" on the pop-up screen. The printer display screen will read "Finished!" Disconnect the power cable from the back of the printer and then plug it back in. Power the printer back on. A "wrong ink tanks" message may appear on your printer's display screen after the installation is complete. To clear this message, remove the cartridges and reinstall them, then you can continue printing with your compatible 288XL printer cartridges again. *Downgrading or reverting your printer firmware may affect other functionality.

With the cartridge still out of the machine, try resetting the printer by powering the printer off, unplugging it for 10-15 seconds, plugging it back in and reinserting the cartridge.

Typically, the shipping lock error message will identify which particular cartridge is giving the error. Troubleshooting Tip #1 First, check that the alienation mechanism on the cartridge is working properly. If the alienation arm is not working as expected, the printer will produce the shipping lock error message. Open up the cartridge tray and locate the problem cartridge. On the right side of the cartridge, you should see a black tab and below that, a white lever. This black tab is the alienation arm. The white lever will move the alienation arm up when you push the lever up towards the back of the printer. When you let go of the white lever the black alienation arm should go back to it's original position. If the alienation arm or white lever are not working, you will need to replace the toner cartridge. Troubleshooting Tip #2 Sometimes switching around the cartridges will clear the shipping lock error message. Power down the printer and then open the cartridge tray. Switch around two of the cartridges so they are in the wrong cartridge slots. You can switch any of the colors. In our example below we've switched the black and the cyan cartridges: Close up the tray and power up the printer again. When you switch the cartridges, an error message will appear on your printer display: "Supplies in wrong positions." Turn the printer off, open the cartridge tray and switch the cartridges back to their original positions. Then, power on the printer again. Troubleshooting Tip #3 The gold contacts on the side of the cartridge tray and on the side of the cartridge may have accumulated dust over time. Sometimes a simple cleaning of these contact points will resolve the shipping lock message. Power down the printer. Then, open the cartridge tray and remove the problem cartridge. With the cartridge out, you should notice some gold contact points on the left side of the cartridge tray. Clean these contact points with a dry, lint-free cloth. Do the same to the the three contact points on the left side of the toner cartridge. Then, reinstall the cartridge and try printing again. If none of these troubleshooting tips work, contact your printer manufacturer for further assistance. Looking to lower your printing costs?

The first thing you'll want to check is the printer's wireless connection. Printers that have been idle for a while may need to be reconnected to the network or your wireless router. Try restarting your wireless router to get your connection up and running again. You may need to update your printer driver or reinstall it completely to get your printer working. Printer drivers are free to download on your printer manufacturer's website. A printer's wireless connection can be flighty at times, which can be frustrating when you are in the middle of a critical print job. Keep a USB cable on hand as a back up if your wireless connection decides to get spotty. A USB cable offers a direct connection between your printer and computer, which leaves little room for a communication error. You will need to reinstall your printer installation software with the USB cable in order to start printing with the cable. To do this, just download the printer driver on your printer manufacturer's website and run the set up. When it asks you how you would like to connect your printer select the USB cable option instead of the wireless one. Looking to lower your printing costs?

Consult your printer manual to determine how to access toner level tracking for your specific machine. The printer should also automatically generate a message on the display or your computer when it is time to replace a cartridge. With most machines, you do not need to replace the toner cartridge immediately when this message first appears. If print quality starts to get spotty, remove the cartridge and gently rock it back and forth a few times over a trashcan to redistribute the toner powder and then reinstall into your printer. This process should keep the cartridge running a bit longer, and hopefully get through a few more print jobs. The most obvious sign of low toner cartridge is poor print quality. Streaking, lines or missed prints are all possible signs that cartridge replacement is imminent. If you have tried rocking the toner cartridge and are still getting poor prints, it is likely time to replace your cartridge. Quality issues might also be attributed to the drum unit if your printer uses a separate toner cartridge and drum. Drum units typically need to be replaced after the use of 3 or 4 toner cartridges, so if it's been a while since you've replaced the drum, you might consider replacing that before buying a new toner cartridge.

Laser printers with a waster toner bottle use a sensor to track the toner waste level, notifying you when it is time for replacement. Not all printer models use a waste toner bottle. Some toner cartridges have a section built into the cartridge that catches the toner, so every time you replace a cartridge, you are also getting rid of toner waste. Check the list of compatible printing supplies for your particular printer model to see if your machine uses a waste toner bottle.

Drum units are a consumable and only need to be replaced after the use of 3 or 4 toners. Not all printers use a separate toner and drum unit. Some printers use toners that have the drum unit incorporated into the toner cartridge and they function as one unit. Consult your printer's user guide to determine what products are correct for your machine. First, we want to check the toner cartridge. Remove the cartridge and rock it back and forth a few times over a trashcan to evenly redistribute the toner powder. Some toner powder may emit from the cartridge as you do this. Reinstall the toner cartridge and run a test print. If the quality does not improve, check your printer's user guide to see if there is a cartridge cleaning function built into the machine. If you can't find your manual, you can usually find a digital copy by searching for it on Google. Run the cleaning function and run another test print. At this point, if your prints are not improving you might just need a new cartridge. If it is a drum related concern, you might need to clean the drum, or simply just replace it. Clean the corona wire inside the drum unit by gently sliding the green tab from left to right and right to left several times. Be sure to return the tab to the home position. For a demonstration, watch the video below: Gently clean the drum roller by wiping it with a lint-free cloth. Please note, the drum unit is very sensitive, do not touch the roller with your fingers. For a demonstration, watch the video below: 2. Some printers are equipped with a built-in drum unit cleaning function. Consult your printer's user guide to see if this is an option for your machine.

Restarting your printer may fix the issue right away. Turn the printer off and let it sit for about a minute before turning it back on. Try to print a test page to see if the printer will run properly. If you still have an issue, check the printer's paper feeder for a paper jam. Any paper can be gently removed from the feeder by pulling evenly on the page with both hands. Inspect the rollers and wheels inside the machine for any small pieces of torn paper and remove. We recommend using a flashlight to make sure you have removed everything. Check for any obstructions under or around the carriage that could prevent it from moving. If you can, carefully remove and reinstall the printer cartridges. Turn the printer off and unplug it from the wall for about a minute, then power it back on.

First, check to make sure the paper is properly aligned in the paper tray. If your paper is askew even a little bit, it can quickly turn into a jam. Usually, removing the paper from the unit and lining it up better to the feeding elements will clear up the problem. Paper trays are designed to hold a specific paper capacity. For some, it could be just 100 sheets, while others can hold an entire ream. Check your printer's user guide for the recommended paper capacity, an overstuffed paper tray is another obvious reason for a jam. Need new ink? (We have paper too!)

The answer is NO! What follows is a partial quote from the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act, which protects your rights and your warranty. MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY IMPROVEMENT ACT United States Code Annotated Title 15 Commerce and Trade Chapter 50 Consumer Product Warranties Section 2032 "No warrantor of a consumer product may condition his written or implied warranty of such product on the consumer's using, in connection with such product, any article or service (other than article or service provided without charge under the terms of the warranty) which is identified by brand, trade or corporate name; except that the prohibition of this subsection be waived by the commission if: The warrantor satisfies the Commission that the warranted product will function properly only if the article or service so identified is used in connection with the warranted product, and the Commission finds that such a waiver is in the public interest. More simply put, your printer warranty cannot be voided just because you choose to use compatible, third-party products unless the manufacturer can prove that the compatible product caused direct damage to your printer. No company, associate, salesperson, or service technician can deny you service or a refund that would otherwise be covered under a warranty program simply because you use a compatible product; your consumer rights are protected by United States law.

To reset the error message and continue printing, follow these simple steps: After installing an LD brand remanufactured PG-245 or CL-246 cartridge, a "low" or "empty" message may appear on the printer's LCD screen. To get the cartridge working you need to force the machine to override that error message and accept the cartridge. First, remove the cartridge and clean the chip, or gold contact points, with a lint free cloth or Q-tip. This will remove any residue that might be on the contact points, which could be the source of the error message. Reinstall the cartridge and hold down the Stop/Reset button on the printer for a full 15 seconds. It may say "please wait a while" on your printer's screen and your printer should go through a startup sequence. Once the startup sequence is complete you should be able to print as expected! After overriding the error message the printer will continue to use the cartridge without stopping due to the ink level being low or empty. You will not be able to tell how much ink is left in your cartridge. However, the cartridge is filled to capacity and you should get the same number of prints as an original! Pro tip: You can use these same steps to resolve an error message on the PG-240 /CL-241 cartridge series too! Need new PG-245 cartridges?

The drum unit typically needs to be replaced after the use of 3-4 toner cartridges. If you are getting streaky or light prints, or a "replace drum" message appears on your printer's display, it may be time to get a new drum. After you replace the drum, you will need to reset the drum counter to continue printing. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage and that count has to be manually reset every time you replace the drum. Here, we show you how to replace an LD brand compatible Brother DR-730 drum unit. To learn how to reset the drum counter, click here. If you are in need of a new drum, you can save money with the LD-brand compatible DR-730 drum here. What printers work with the DR-730 drum unit? DCP-L2550DW, HL-L2350DW, HL-L2370DW, HL-L2370DW XL, HL-L2390DW, HL-L2395DW, MFC-L2710DW, MFC-L2750DW, MFC-L2750DW XL The instructions below work for the Brother HL-L2350DW and HL-L2370 DW printers. If you own one of the other printers mentioned above, please consult your printer manual for replacement instructions. Brother DR-730 Drum Replacement Instructions Checking the drum life To check the drum life manually, press the plus and minus buttons on your printer's display Scroll down to "Machine info" and then press "OK" Scroll to "Parts Life" and press "OK" Scroll to "Drum Life" and press "OK" If the remaining drum life reads "0%" you will need to replace your drum unit Replacing the drum Remove your new LD compatible DR-730 drum unit from the packaging Take out the old drum unit from the printer. The toner cartridge and drum unit will come out together as one attached unit. You will need to remove the toner cartridge from the drum to replace it. Click down on the green lever on the lower left side of the drum unit to separate the two consumables. This will release the toner cartridge from the drum. If you are using that same toner cartridge, you can set that aside. Please note, you do not need to replace the toner cartridge and drum unit at the same time. If your toner cartridge is still good, it can be used with your new drum unit. Take your new drum unit and insert the toner cartridge into the drum. You should hear a click and the cartridge should be secure. Before installing it back in the printer, slide the green tab (corona wire) back and forth a few times to prep the unit for the printer.

If you own a Brother HL-L5100D laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your machine's display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother HL-L5100D. This printer works with Brother TN-820 and TN-850 toner cartridges and the DR-820 drum unit. If you are in need of a new drum, you can save money with the LD-brand compatible DR-820 drum here. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: Make sure that the printer is on and press open the front cover. Remove the toner cartridge and drum unit from the machine. Push down the green lock lever and remove the toner cartridge from the drum unit. Unpack the new drum unit. Click the toner cartridge into the new drum unit until you hear it lock into place. Clean the corona wire inside the drum unit by gently sliding the green tab from left to right and right to left a couple of times. Install the toner cartridge and drum back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter. How to reset the drum counter: Make sure the machine is on. Open the front cover.

If you own a Brother HL-L6250DW laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your machine's display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother HL-L6250DW. This printer works with Brother TN-820 and TN-850 toner cartridges and the DR-820 drum unit. If you are in need of a new drum, you can save money with the LD-brand compatible DR-820 drum here. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: Make sure that the printer is on and press open the front cover. Remove the toner cartridge and drum unit from the machine. Push down the green lock lever and remove the toner cartridge from the drum unit. Unpack the new drum unit. Click the toner cartridge into the new drum unit until you hear it lock into place. Clean the corona wire inside the drum unit by gently sliding the green tab from left to right and right to left a couple of times. Install the toner cartridge and drum back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter. How to reset the drum counter: Make sure the machine is on. Open the front cover. Press and hold OK for about two seconds to display Drum Unit, and then press OK. Press for [Reset] to reset the drum counter. Close the front cover.

Your cartridges need to move freely across the printer carriag...","metaKeywords":["printer","paper","cartridges","assembly","cartridge","can","back","area","across","check","printer.","access","try"],"metaTitle":"","htmlBody":" A stuck printer cartridge is a major nuisance when you are in the middle of a print job. Your cartridges need to move freely across the printer carriage to create a print. When one of the cartridges isn't moving, you might hear a grinding noise and will likely see an error message on your printer display screen that is informing you there is something preventing the cartridge from moving across the carriage. A paper jam is usually the cause, and you can quickly clear the message after finding and removing the piece of paper that is initiating the message. Tip # 1: Check the paper tray and inside of the printer for paper jams Using a flashlight, remove the paper tray and check the area for a paper jam or any bits of loose paper that may be causing an error message on the printer. If your printer has multiple paper trays, you will want to check them all. Then, open the cartridge access area to check for a paper jam here too. Gently remove any paper that is stuck inside the printer, then try printing again. Tip #2: Perform a hard reset on the printer If a paper jam is not the cause, a hard reset is a good next step. With the printer still on, unplug the printer cable from the back of the printer and then unplug the cable from the power outlet. Let the printer sit for about a minute, then open the cartridge access area and try to gently slide the stuck cartridge across the cartridge access area from left to right a few times. You do not want to be too forceful but there may be a little resistance as you are sliding the cartridges. Check to make sure that the cartridges can move fully across the carriage path. Then return the cartridges back to their original position before closing the access area and powering back up the printer. Tip #3: Clean the cartridge contacts After the hard reset, you can also try cleaning the gold contact points on the side of the cartridge. Sometimes fingerprint oil or dust can get on these contact points and cause a communication problem between your cartridges and the printer. Remove all cartridges from the printer. With a lint-free cloth, clean the gold contact chip on the side of each cartridge, then reinstall the cartridges and try printing again. Tip #4: Try removing the printhead assembly The printhead assembly holds the ink cartridges as they move back and forth across the printer carriage. If your printer has a removable printhead assembly, you can remove it from the printer and check for paper stuck underneath the assembly that could be causing an error. To remove the assembly, first, make sure all the cartridges have been removed from the printer. You won't be able to access the assembly if the cartridges are still installed! Most printers with a removeable assembly have a latch handle on the side of the assembly that firmly keeps it in place. When you pull up on the latch handle, it will free the assembly from the printer and you can pull it out and check the area underneath where the assembly was for any obstructions. Then, slide the assembly back into place and pull the latch handle down to secure it. Once it is back in the printer you can reinstall the printer cartridges and try printing again. If you still have issues after trying these troubleshooting steps, contact your printer manufacturer for further troubleshooting or service information. Need new ink cartridges?

If you own a printer that prints with just two cartridges (a black and tri-color cartridge), like most inexpensive inkjet printers from HP and Canon, you might be able to temporarily print with only your color cartridge. Follow these steps to start printing again in seconds... Make sure your printer is on and open up the cartridge access area. Remove the black cartridge from the printer and set it aside. Then close up the cartridge access area. Doing this tells your printer to print in "single cartridge mode", which lets you print with just the color cartridge. Print the document again. The black ink should appear on the page now. This is because your color cartridge is combining colors to create black. Keep in mind, doing this will quickly deplete your color cartridge since it is now using color ink to create black, so we recommend using this as a temporary fix until you can either resolve the issue with black cartridge or are able to replace the cartridge.

If you own a Brother MFC-L2710DW laser printer and you are getting a "Replace Drum" message on your machine's display, it might be time to get a new drum. Your printer uses a page counter to track usage, which must manually be reset every time a new drum unit is installed. Replacement instructions vary depending on what printer model you have. Check your printer's user guide for specific replacement instructions for your machine. These can be accessed on Brother's website. Here, we provide replacement and reset instructions for the Brother MFC-L2710DW. This printer works with Brother TN-730 and TN-760 toner cartridges and the DR-730 drum unit. If you are in need of a new drum, you can save money with the LD-brand compatible DR-730 drum here. First, you will need to remove the old drum and replace it with the new one. How to replace the drum unit: Make sure that the printer is on and press open the front cover. Remove the toner cartridge and drum unit from the machine. Push down the green lock lever and remove the toner cartridge from the drum unit. Unpack the new drum unit. Click the toner cartridge into the new drum unit until you hear it lock into place. Clean the corona wire inside the drum unit by gently sliding the green tab from left to right and right to left a couple of times. Install the toner cartridge and drum back into the printer. Once the new drum is replaced, you will need to reset the drum counter. How to reset the drum counter: The printer should be on. Close the front of the printer. Hold down the "OK" button and the "up" arrow at the same time. Press the "OK" button to select "Drum". Press the "up" arrow to reset the counter.

Most fit problems are due to the accidental purchase of the wrong printer cartridge. Before installing the cartridge, confirm that you purchased the correct product for your printer. Printer cartridges are not interchangeable across printer models. You must use the appropriate printer cartridge for your printer in order for the machine to work. If you are not sure you have the right cartridge, consult your printer's user guide for printer compatibility or your manufacturer's website. LD Products also includes a list of compatible printers on every cartridge page. You'll also want to make sure you have removed all of the shipping or packing materials that are around the cartridge. If there is an orange clip or a yellow piece tape on your ink cartridge, this should be removed. Toner cartridges will often include an orange clip as well, which should also be removed.

For a complete breakdown of our shipping costs, including estimated transit time, non-contiguous shipping rates, Canadian shipping rates, expedited shipping options and other shipping information, see our shipping policy page. General Shipping Terms Orders under $50.00 that are shipping to the contiguous U.S. are charged a flat rate of $4.95. Orders shipping to the contiguous U.S. over $50.00 are shipped FREE (HI, AK, APO, PR, Guam, etc. excluded). U.S Non-Contiguous Orders Orders shipping to non-contiguous U.S. territories will ship through the U.S. Postal Service according to the rate chart found here. This includes Alaska, Hawaii, APO, FPO, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, & Palau. Canadian Orders We've made shipping easy for our Canadian customers by partnering exclusively with DHL for all orders going to Canada. Rates start at just $7.99! No longer worry about surprise customs fees or multiple postal carriers, our rates take care of everything upfront and DHL handles your order for the entirety of the shipment. Additional applicable taxes and/or customs fees will be added at checkout. As soon as your order ships, we'll send you a shipping confirmation email with DHL tracking information. Most orders ship out the same day and can take between 4-9 business days to arrive at their destination. Expedited Shipping You may upgrade your shipping option to FedEx 2 Day during checkout by paying actual 2nd Day shipping rates. The 2nd Day option is only available if you live in a state where UPS Ground takes more than 2 days to deliver from our warehouse in Long Beach, CA. (This protects you from unnecessarily paying for 2nd day shipping when the UPS Ground or Priority Mail service would get there in the same amount of time). Shipping time starts when your package leaves our facility. If you require overnight shipping please call us at 888.321.2552 as we do not have this option available for internet orders at this time. Shipping Details We ship from Long Beach, CA, Monday-Friday. Orders placed before 4PM PST usually ship out the same day. Typically, orders placed after 4PM PST will ship the following day. Orders placed Friday after 4PM PST will ship the following Monday or next business day. Shipping time usually takes 3-5 working days to arrive to the East Coast and 1-3 working days on the West Coast. Our orders are imported every few hours into our internal processing system. At that time you will receive your order number via email and another email will follow with tracking number details a few hours after the item leaves our facility. Transit times start when your package leaves our facility. Transit times are not guaranteed and shipping costs are not refundable. Tracking emails are sent M-F night from our internal system from notices@LDProducts.com.

With so many choices, it's easy to get distracted by the best deal of the week, instead of considering other equally important factors like total cost of operation and cartridge yield. Many assume that if the machine is offered at a reasonable price, the consumables, page yield and print quality must be too. To make a smart decision you have to do some research and a bit of personal reflection too. In this article we'll go over some of the top home and business printers available for a decent price, so you can buy the best machine to get the job done. Best Printers for Home Use Brother® MFC-J460DW Small and inexpensive, the Brother MFC-J460DW is a nice all-in-one option for the average home user. Appreciated for its ability to print, scan and copy, all three functions are very useful features to have at your fingertips. The Brother MFC-J460DW's ink cartridges are far less expensive than other similarly priced printers and its wireless connectivity option is nice to have when you are not close to the computer. The automatic duplex printing function will help you save paper and money, allowing you to conveniently print on both sides of the page. Epson® Expression® XP-420 The Epson Expression XP-420 is a bit cheaper than the Brother but it makes up for its price tag on the slightly more expensive cartridges. But its other features, like its ability to print beautiful smudge-free photos, might make the price of the Epson 220 a more worthwhile value, depending on your needs. It is also an all-in-one functionality machine and a handy built-in card slot is a nice feature to have for photo printing from your camera. Both machines require 4 ink cartridges (black, cyan, magenta and yellow). With a four color ink tank, you only need to replace the problem color which might save you a lot of money in the long term. Best Printers for Business Use Printing habits vary from business to business, so finding the right machine for your company, might take some extensive research. To figure out what works for you, make a calculated assessment of what your company's habits are, take a look at our small business printer guide here. We've got two recommendations here that are relatively inexpensive and they may just be what your company needs. Brother® HL-6180dw The Brother HL-6180dw model is a reasonably priced monochrome printer that is ideal for heavy duty office printing. A compact machine, it fits neatly onto any desk or work surface. It features an easy to use control panel and it's built in wireless function makes mobile printing a snap. The Brother HL series also offers competitively priced cartridges making it one of the least expensive printers in it class when breaking down total cost of ownership. A genuine TN780 Super High Yield Toner offers a yield of 12,000 pages and goes for $112.99, making the total cost around 1 cents per page. If you go with a reputable compatible TN780 alternative at $24.99, the total cost is a steal at .4 cents per page! Canon® Maxify® iB4020 The Canon Maxify iB4020 is an inkjet printer that's a great fit for any business. If your company prints in color regularly and you don't want to spend a bundle on multiple color toner cartridges inkjet printers are a compelling alternative. The Maxify series is a good place to start due to its economical price tag and high capacity ink cartridges. Its color output for graphics and photographs is impressive, especially when compared to your typical color laser printer. The Canon Maxify is a nice go-between, you get the durability and workhorse capacity of a laserjet with the precision and color brilliance of an inkjet, all rolled into one very capable machine. Printer shopping may be overwhelming at first glance, but it's easy to make a great purchase once you've done your research. Keep in mind the total cost of the printer, not just the initial printer price, and you should be able to buy a machine that suits your needs. *Savings based on price comparison between remanufactured/compatible cartridge prices and printer brand (OEM) cartridge prices effective as of January 4, 2017 on www.LDProducts.com.

Pagewide technology is a relatively new innovation from HP, and although it delivers on speed and performance, the total cost of operation may not add up for some. In this article we will explain how Pagewide technology works in a HP OfficeJet® Enterprise Color MFP X585, and do a bit of cost analysis on that model as well. Pagewide technology is remarkably different than the standard inkjet printer technology most of us are used to. We've all seen an inkjet printer in an action; the printhead scans across the page from left to right to create a print, releasing microscopic ink droplets on the page along the way. With Pagewide technology, HP has created a stationary printhead that is designed to print across the entire page in a single pass. Single pass printing is much more accurate than the typical inkjet, and considerably faster too. The HP Officejet Pro X series boasts page speeds of up to 70 ppm, a Guinness Book World Record! Speed and accuracy shouldn't be the only two deciding factors when it's time to purchase a new printer model. Our cost analysis may put a slightly different perspective on the technology, especially when you factor in the total lifetime cost of owning and operating the printer. Independent research company the Buyer's Lab conducted a reliability test on the HP OfficeJet Enterprise Color MFP X585, concluding that the machine was capable of printing up to 200,000 pages without failure, an impressive number for any printer. If you compare that page count against the actual cost of HP brand ink it takes to reach that total, the price of reliability might be a concern. Staples is currently selling the printer for $1,436.79 and each machine requires a black, cyan, magenta and yellow cartridge. The standard black cartridge goes for $113.99 and offers 10,000 prints. Each color is sold for $97.99 and offers 6,600 prints per cartridge. Factor a little math into the price point and 200,000 prints will end up costing you quite a bit. If you just print in black ink, you will end up spending $2,279.80 on ink alone, almost twice the cost of the printer. You can get the same amount of prints and comparable results for far less when you choose a compatible alternative cartridge. LD Products offers the same amount of ink for just $699.80, a mere fraction of the genuine brand cost. HP OfficeJet Enterprise Color MFP X585 Page Yield Genuine HP Brand Cost* Compatible Brand Cost* HP 980 Black Standard Yield Cartridge (D8J10A) 10,000 $113.99 $34.99 HP 980 Cyan Standard Yield Cartridge (D8J07A) 6,600 $97.99 $34.99 HP 980 Magenta Standard Yield Cartridge (D8J08A) 6,600 $97.99 $34.99 HP 980 Yellow Standard Yield Cartridge (D8J09A) 6,600 $97.99 $34.99 The next time you are in the market for a new printer, consider the entire cost of the printer into the purchase. Cartridge price should be a major deciding factor because that is where you will be investing the majority of your money, once you get past the initial sticker price. New technology is great but it's easy to get distracted by features and lose sight of buying basics like operating cost. Keep that in mind and you should be well on your way to finding a printer that suits both your needs and your budget. *Savings based on price comparison between remanufactured/compatible cartridge prices and printer brand (OEM) cartridges effective as of February 13, 2016 on www.LDProducts.com.

Many HP cartridges, as well as some other manufacturers, have a long sku, a short part number and, sometimes, even an alternative part number. For example, HP's #56 cartridge is also known as the 56A C6656, C6656A and C6656AN. These are all the same product and have the same ink volume, but are displayed using various shortened versions of the full part number, which is C6656AN. Most HP cartridges are available with different ink volumes. HP cartridges with different ink volumes are identified by a different letter at the end of the number sequence. For example, HP cartridge 51645G and 51645A are identical cartridges, but have different ink volumes. The \"G\" is the free starter cartridge that comes with a printer and the \"A" is the regular high volume cartridge that is sold in stores. When our house-brand cartridges are manufactured, they are always filled completely. So, regardless of the letter at the end of the HP part number, or the letter at the end of the HP cartridge that you normally order, you will always get a cartridge with a high-ink volume from LD.

The amount of time it takes for a cartridge to go empty is an inaccurate indicator of its page yield. The manufacturer's cited page yield for ink and toner cartridges is given at 5% coverage. This means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only 5% of the page has been imprinted with ink. This comes out to be a small amount of imprinted ink - roughly one quarter of the page. For example, a short memo has approximately 5% coverage. If you are printing letters, using legal size paper, printing photos, web pages or any type of graphics, your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly. There are two ways to properly check for yield. First is to utilize any page count your printer has. Refer the user's manual for instructions. The other way is to count reams or boxes of paper you have used with each cartridge. Both of these methods will tell you how many pages per cartridge you are using Please keep in mind that although both methods provide you with an approximation, your cartridge's yield will ultimately depend on your printing practices. You should also take into consideration the typical print coverage on the pages that you are producing. For instance, if you only print short memos you will reach - or, come close to - the manufacturer's state page yield. In contrast, if you write full page letters or print graphics, your page yield will be considerably less. A cartridge with a 4000 page yield, for example, will run out of ink or toner at around 800 pages when used to print full pages of text and graphics with a high percentage of ink or toner coverage. To find out how many pages your cartridge will print, scroll down to the specifications table on one of our product pages.

Not only will it help save you money, it will keep your printer happy and healthy too. A couple of simple cartridge care tips can make a huge difference, resulting in better print quality, longer lasting ink, and less troubleshooting when you're in the middle of a major print job. Handling your ink cartridge. Proper care starts the moment you bring home a new cartridge. Before you install the cartridge, be sure to inspect it. Gently shake the cartridge or tap it on a hard surface a couple times to prime the ink. On the top of most cartridges, you'll find a piece of plastic tape that covers the vent hole and a plastic clip that is protecting the cartridge while in transit. Not every cartridge will have a clip or tape, but if they do it's important to remove them before you try installing your ink. We recommend doing this over a trashcan as ink can sometimes escape from the cartridge when you remove the tape. On the side of the cartridge, you might notice a gold contact chip. This chip is very sensitive, as it is the electric component that communicates with the printer once it is installed. If you do accidentally touch it with your finger or notice a bit of dust, gently wipe it clean with a Q-tip or lint-free cloth. Installing your ink cartridge. When it comes to installing a cartridge, every printer is a little different. Before you try to install your ink cartridge for the first time, be sure to reference your printer's instruction manual. If your printer didn't include an instruction manual, you can usually find a PDF version available for download on the manufacturer's website. Youtube is another great resource for cartridge installation videos, troubleshooting and printer reviews, just search by your printer model. Storing and protecting your ink cartridge. If your business buys in bulk, you're going to want to know the best way to store those extra cartridges. First, we recommend keeping the cartridges in their sealed packaging until you need them. If you remove a cartridge from it's packaging and it is sitting out for a period, it will eventually dry out. Storing them upright in a relatively dark closet is also preferred. Cartridges left on their side might shift the ink to one side, which could affect your print results once installed in the machine. If you happen to have an opened cartridge lying around reseal it as best you can. If you have the protective tape or clip, reapply it before storing. What if I'm getting poor print results? Poor prints are usually the result of a depleted ink cartridge. Before you throw in the towel and go out and buy a new cartridge, there are a few troubleshooting tips worth pursuing that may get more life out of the cartridge. If your prints are looking light or streaky, your cartridge might just need to be primed. Prolonged inactivity can cause the ink to settle, which might temporarily dry up the printhead. Different ink cartridges will be primed in different ways. For cartridges with integrated print heads, such as the HP® 62, we suggest trying the paper towel method: First, grab a damp paper towel and a dry paper towel, folding both into quarters. Take your cartridge and blot it onto the damp paper towel a couple of times with the printhead side down. The printhead is gold or copper strip located on the end of the cartridge and ink should appear on the paper towel as you blot. Be careful not to mistake the print head with the gold or copper contacts or dots, which are where the printer interacts with the cartridge. After blotting the printhead with the damp paper towel, hold the cartridge against a dry paper towel for about thirty seconds to a minute. This will wick out the dried ink that may be clogging the head. Once completed, you're ready to slide the cartridge back into your printer and run a test print. If you still aren't getting good results, try this process again. If your printer uses individual color cartridges, like the Epson 822XL series for example, the paper towel method won't be effective. Instead, we recommend running a printhead cleaning, which is a function that is built into the hardware of most machines. Consult your printer's user guide to run the printhead cleaning, it can usually be found under the "Tools" or "Maintenance" section of the printer menu. We walk you through the process below using an Epson WorkForce WF-3820, but the steps are similar no matter which printer you are using. How do you know when it's the printhead that's the problem? Like any other machine, printheads have a life span for use before they need replacement. The first sign your printhead may be nearing replacement is a loss of print quality. If the issue is a simple printhead clog, running a cleaning cycle or two should clear out all the dried ink. If you replace the ink cartridges after the cleaning cycles and the print quality hasn't improved, your printhead may be the culprit. Most printers today offer up some type of warning that there's a structural problem with your printhead, indicating on the LCD screen with a warning like "printhead problem" or "printhead appears to be missing or damaged" to take a lot of the mystery out of your problems. Most printheads are easily replaceable, but they can get expensive. In many cases, replacing the printhead will cost as much as purchasing a replacement printer. And in other cases, installing a new printhead can be complicated and require some technical skill. Before you purchase a new replacement part, consult with the instruction manual to see whether or not it's worth it. Often, a failed printhead is the perfect opportunity to pick up a unit that is better suited for your business, helping you save money in the long term. Getting the most from your ink cartridge. Printing with regularity keeps your cartridges primed and ready to go, lowering the likelihood that your ink settles. It will also prevent the ink in the nozzle from drying up and creating clogs. When printing articles or emails, print in draft mode. This uses less ink per page and will actually print faster than regular mode. Unless you're printing photos or something for a presentation, there is usually no need to print in the highest quality setting. Don't run the print cleaning too often. Cleaning your printhead is designed to prevent clogs and maintain the quality of your prints but running it repeatedly can quickly deplete your cartridge's ink supply. If you are attempting to fix a quality issue and have to continuously run the cleaning function, it may be time to get a new cartridge. Always keep a full set of cartridges in your machine, even when you aren't regularly printing in color. Open spaces on a built-in printhead can introduce air into the machine, which will dry out the cartridges over time. Even an old cartridge that is empty is better than leaving a gap. Keeping up with regular maintenance helps you get better quality prints with less headaches in the long run. When you turn these tips into regular habits, you'll prolong the life of your cartridges and save a bit of money too.

How to Replace Ink Cartridges in the OfficeJet® Pro 6978 Printer How to Check Ink Levels on the OfficeJet 6978 If your prints are not up to par, first check the ink levels on your printer's display. 1. Press the gear symbol in the corner of the LCD screen. 2. Scroll down to "cartridge information" and you'll see an estimation of the cartridge ink levels. If one of the levels is low, like the magenta in our video, it's time to get a new cartridge! Installing or Replacing a Cartridge 1. Lift up the scanner unit and wait for the cartridge carriage to reach the center of the machine. 2. Remove the old cartridge by gently pushing on it. It should pop up and easily remove from the slot. 3. Remove the plastic wrap the cartridge came in. Pro Tip: Prep your new cartridges over a trashcan because a bit of ink might escape from the cartridge. 4. With the cartridge over the trashcan, remove the orange clip on the bottom of the cartridge with a simple twisting motion. This clip protects the cartridge while it's in transit and the cartridge will not fit into the printer if you leave this on. 5. Remove is the yellow tape on the top of the cartridge. Hold the cartridge in one hand and gently pull up on the tape with the other. This will expose the vent hole on the cartridge so it can work in your machine. Pro Tip: Try not to touch the gold contact chip when handling the new cartridge. This chip is very sensitive and touching it might cause an error message on your machine. 6. Install the new magenta cartridge by sliding it into the appropriate slot in the printer. The tab goes in the back. 7. Press straight down on the cartridge and it will click into place. 8. Close the scanner unit. 9. The printer will display a "Genuine Cartridge Installed" message if you used an OEM HP 902 cartridge. Need new HP 902 ink cartridges?

In this article, we break down the all of the basic factors that influence the life of your print cartridge, including shelf life and cartridge expiration dates so you can get the most from your printer. Ink cartridges can dry out over time. If they are sitting in your machine for an extended period, they will eventually dry up and become unusable. We recommend printing once every couple of weeks to keep your ink cartridges operating smoothly. A printhead cleaning can usually get an idle cartridge up and running again. If dried up ink is causing a clog, the cleaning function works to prime your cartridges. We walk you through the process below using an Epson WorkForce WF-3820, but the steps are similar no matter which printer you are using Consult your printer manual for specific cleaning steps for your machine. Toner cartridges are a slightly different story... Toner cartridges will not dry out the same way an ink cartridge would due to the toner that is inside the cartridge. Unlike, ink, which is liquid-based, toner is a dry powder composed of plastic components so it will not dry out. You can leave a toner cartridge in your printer for weeks untouched, and it should still print. What is my cartridge's shelf life? The shelf life of a printer cartridge is the approximate amount of time a cartridge will last in its sealed package. The shelf life for an original printer cartridge is 24 months and the shelf life for a compatible cartridge is 36 months. Why do some cartridges have expiration dates? Expiration dates are included on cartridges to encourage users to print before their printer ink becomes susceptible to clogs or print quality issues. Dates can be found on the side of the cartridge or on the cartridge box. Many factors, not just the expiration date, contribute to the eventual deterioration of a printer cartridge, including how it's stored, the temperature of the storage environment and whether it's in a sealed package or not. Can I still use the cartridge after the expiration date? Cartridges last longer when stored properly in the correct environment. Most last for at least two years after the purchase date if they remain in their sealed package. Even after two years, your cartridge might still be usable, so it could be worth trying. Keep in mind, an expired cartridge could potentially clog your printhead, which can be an expensive to fix, depending on what printer model you have. Cartridges can dry up if they are not used properly. To get the most out of your printer cartridge, make sure it remains sealed and is stored upright in a cool, dark space like a desk cupboard. Once installed, be sure that you run a print job at least once every couple of weeks to keep the cartridge primed. We hope this guide was helpful.

This error message is usually the result of a cartridge that is not firmly seated in its designated slot. To troubleshoot the problem, begin by completely removing the cartridge from its port. Reinstall the cartridge by positioning it so that it snaps into place and is securely fastened in its slot. Keep in mind that your printer doesn't actually read the amount of ink in the cartridge. Printer software simply estimates the amount of ink remaining in the cartridge by remembering the number of pages that were printed when the previous cartridge was installed, and using this information to estimate when your next cartridge should be replaced. If a new cartridge is installed before the printer driver resets, there is a chance that the printer may think that the old empty cartridge is still being used. To fix the issue, reinstall the cartridge and click on the install new cartridge option; you may have to refer to your printer's manual for further instructions. Selecting the new cartridge option will indicate to your printer that a new cartridge has been installed which will then prompt it to reset the page counter. This should eliminate the error message.

This series uses a black and tri-color ink cartridge and they are sold in both a standard and high yield size. Combo pack varieties are also available. In this article, we will go over everything you need to know about the HP 61 series. From printer compatibility to common troubleshooting tips, we've put together a comprehensive guide so you can be an HP 61 expert just like us! What size cartridge do I need? HP 61 black and color ink cartridges are sold in two sizes: standard and high yield (XL) size. Standard cartridges are great for someone that prints occasionally. If you print a lot, you will find it's a better deal to pay a bit extra for the high yield version. High yield cartridges are filled with almost double the amount of ink, so you will obviously get more prints out of the cartridge. A standard black cartridge prints approximately 180 pages and a standard tri-color cartridge prints 150 pages. The XL black offers a page yield of 455 pages and the XL color offers 310 pages. What printers do HP 61 cartridges work with? The HP 61 ink cartridge works with a wide range of Deskjet®, ENVY® and OfficeJet® printers. Some of the more popular ones are the Deskjet 2540, the Deskjet 1000 series and the HP ENVY 4500 and 5530 series. Check out the complete list of compatible printers here: How do I install my cartridges? Installation for your new HP 61 ink cartridges is a snap: just center the carriage, remove the empty cartridge, and replace it with the new one. Check out the video for step by step instructions: Please note: Most printers that use the HP 61 call for a similar installation process to the one shown in the video but be sure to reference your printer's user guide for model specific instructions. More information on replacing HP ink cartridges can be found here: Please note: Most printers that use the HP 61 call for a similar installation process to the one shown in the video but be sure to reference your printer's user guide for model specific instructions. More information on replacing HP ink cartridges can be found here. How do I refill my cartridges? Before you refill make sure you have some paper towels on hand, refilling a cartridge can get messy. You might also want to put on a pair of cleaning gloves to avoid ink stains on your hands. Over a trash can, peel the label from the front of the cartridge. On the front of the cartridge you will see three holes. For black ink cartridges, all three will be black. For color cartridges, each hole will correspond to the color well for each of the three colors. Use a toothpick or paper clip and poke the hole to determine which color it is (the top one will be yellow, but the other two may be switched depending on the age of the cartridge). If you are using a standard black cartridge, fill your syringe with 15 ml ink. Fill it up to 25 ml if you are using an XL. Each color for the color cartridges can be filled with 7ml of ink. In every cartridge there are sponges that soak up the ink, and once they reach capacity some may leak out the top. Be sure to cover the two color holes you are not filling during the fill process to prevent any leaks from contaminating across colors. Slowly push the plunger and apply the ink to the cartridge. If you go too quickly you might cause it to overflow. To remove any excess ink, wipe the front of the cartridge with a clean paper towel. Pop the refilled cartridges back in your printer and run a cleaning cycle (you may need to consult your printer manual). Print a couple test pages to draw the ink into the sponge and help even out the refill. Let the cartridge sit in your printer for six to eight hours before resuming regular printing. How do I fix a cartridge error message? Getting an error on your printer screen or computer that says "Incompatible Ink Cartridge" or "Ink Cartridge Error" is rare, but not uncommon. Even with a brand new cartridge, sometimes dried ink, fingerprint oil or tape residue can find itself on the gold and copper electrical contacts, causing the cartridge to not read properly in your machine. To remove any residue, gently clean the contacts with a lint free cloth or coffee filter and a dab of rubbing alcohol. Check out this video to see how to properly clean printer contacts: Before you put the cartridge back in the machine, power it down, unplug the power cord and let it sit for about a minute. Then turn it back on, plug it back in and reseat the cartridge. A cartridge clean and printer reset usually will clear up a compatibility message right away. If you attempt this a couple of times and still are not able to resolve the error message, you may have a faulty cartridge. Test another HP 61 cartridge and compare the outcome, if the second cartridge works as expected then the initial problem cartridge you can confirm this. Faulty cartridges are not very common but they are always a possibility. Check your supplier's warranty on faulty products, if you've purchased the cartridge recently you will probably qualify for a replacement cartridge. How do I fix a missing cartridge message? The old "ink cartridge missing" message usually comes up because your cartridge is not installed properly. This is easily corrected by a couple of steps. First, check to make sure your cartridge clicks securely into its designated slot. It should not be loose in the printer or forced into the machine. If it does not click in easily you might have the cartridge angled wrong or installed in the wrong slot. If it you do this and still get the missing message, take it out and clean the cartridge contacts. You can also try resetting the printer (see instructions in previous paragraph). A reset will should resolve the error message. If you still have trouble, try a second cartridge and compare results. How do I fix an empty cartridge message? "Empty" or "previously used" used messages are a common occurrence when you are installing a remanufactured cartridge. The chip on a remanufactured cartridge cannot be reset so an empty ink cartridge message is generally expected. This doesn't mean your cartridge is missing ink. Since the cartridge is refurbished your printer is reading it as if it was still the original cartridge that has already been used. Even though your printer cannot tell, the cartridge is filled to capacity and should print the same amount of prints as an original. To get around the error, clean the contacts, reset the printer and accept the empty cartridge message by pressing the "OK" or "Resume" button on your machine. By accepting the error message, you should be able to print as. "Empty cartridge" messages do not typically occur with genuine brand HP cartridges. A genuine product should work in your machine right away and read the appropriate ink levels on your printer's display. How do I prevent streaky prints? Poor print quality on a recently installed cartridge usually stems from an issue with the cartridge's printhead. The printhead on an HP 61 is located on the end of the cartridge where the ink comes out and is typically a gold or copper strip. We recommend using the "paper towel" method to prime the cartridge: Grab a damp paper towel and a dry paper towel. Use the damp paper towel to blot the cartridge with the printhead side down on the towel. After blotting a couple of times, ink should be appearing on the paper towel. Be careful not to confuse the printhead with the gold and copper contacts or dots. Hold the cartridge against the dry paper towel for about 30 seconds. This will wick out any dried ink that might be causing the streak. Put the cartridge back in the printer and run a test print. If it doesn't work the first time, repeat the process again. If the second time doesn't work, try out our next tip: printhead cleaning! If that doesn't work, try this: Most printers have a built in cleaning function that's used to prime your cartridges. For most HP printers, you can find the cleaning function under the "Tools" menu. Check your user's guide for specific instructions on your model. After running a cleaning your printer will prompt you to print a diagnostic page. Printing a test page lets you know if the cleaning worked. If the quality is still poor after the cleaning, run a second cleaning. It may take a couple of cleanings to get a cartridge working like you want it to. If you run a few cleanings and still aren't getting what you want, you are probably dealing with a bad cartridge or printhead. If that's the case, install a new cartridge. Original HP cartridges are pricey. What's a good way to cut down on my cartridge costs? Remanufactured HP 61 cartridges are a great money saving alternative to the original brand. Each printer ink cartridge is rebuilt and refilled to offer comparable results to the HP brand and you can save a bundle on your ink costs!

Last fall, Epson changed things up with their EcoTank® printer line, a continuous ink system that hopes to get customers (and the print industry) to reconsider their relationship with ink. But depending on your printing habits, the savings may not be all that remarkable. The EcoTank series includes a few different models, all of which are under the Workforce® umbrella. The ET-2550 is the most basic model of the bunch and is intended for home office users. Epson sells the printer for $299.99 it includes enough ink to print up to 4,000 black pages and 6,500 color pages. Each ink tank goes for $12.99 apiece. On paper the ET-2550 seems like a very enticing option and for the right customer it might be. But if you only print occasionally, the overall cost savings is minimal. Consumer Reports conducted some independent research when the series was first released and their survey found that the average user prints 23 pages of text, nine pages of graphics and about nine photos per month. After testing the 2550 against similarly classed standard inkjet printers they found that the cost savings of the EcoTank only begins to add up after five years. It is fairly common for consumers to replace their printer after a few years, and due to the newness of the series, the longevity of the Ecotank series remains to be seen. If you print a few times a month you might be better off paying for compatible ink cartridges as needed. Compare the price and you'll find that many compatible cartridges are on par with the Eco Tank series. Compatibles allow consumers the freedom to spend money on ink as they need it, rather than paying for the printer and ink upfront. As the EcoTank series increases in price the savings are harder to find. The Ecotank WF-R4640 is ideal for small business owners and at first glance, its print capabilities are compelling. Instead of the ink tank system, a black and a color ink pack is included with each printer and every bag holds enough ink to yield 20,000 pages per color. The savings become a bit suspect when you start comparing the upfront cost of the machine and consumables to a comparable, but far less expensive Epson inkjet. A $950 Price Difference on Printers Action Intell confirmed, in terms of features, that the standard functioning WF-4640 series is very similar to the EcoTank WF-R4640. Both have an identical print speed and the same print, scan, and fax capabilities. Other than the ink system, the main difference is the cost of the machine. Epson sells the EcoTank for $1,199.99 while the WF-4640 is only $249.99, just on printer price alone you would be ahead $950 if you were to choose the conventional Epson Workforce. If you add in the price of ink the operating cost of the EcoTank continues to add up. The EcoTank's 20,000 page high yield black ink bag is sold for $179.99, and each color is offered at $99.99 apiece. We crunched some numbers to figure out what the cost would be for a compatible cartridge if you wanted to match that same 20,000 page yield offered by the EcoTank, and the savings on compatible ink is remarkable. If purchased as a bundle, a 2,600 yield LD brand compatible black ink cartridge costs $9.00*. You would need to spend around $69.30, or buy 7.7 compatible cartridges to match the 20,000 page yield offered by one black EcoTank ink pack. Each LD brand compatible color cartridge also is sold for $9.00 when bundled, and yields 2,000 pages. You would need to spend $270 to buy the 30 color cartridges needed to match the 20,000 page color ink pack. If you look at the price of the EcoTank printer alone ($1,199.99) and subtract it from the total price of a new WF-4640 printer ($249.99) plus the number of cartridges needed to give you a yield of 20,000 pages ($339.30), you would be ahead $610.70. For a quick breakdown, check out the chart below: Depending on your business, the EcoTank series simply may not be worth the money. If you take a moment to do the math, you can buy 60,000 pages worth of compatible ink with a conventional Workforce before you break even on the EcoTank. (339.30 x 3 =$1,017.90). New print technology like the EcoTank series is encouraging. Manufacturers are offering other print solutions besides the well-known razor-and-blades model that's been a fixture the printer market for decades, and ink tank system printers could be the new normal in a few short years. For now, a cheaper printer paired with compatible cartridges is still a compelling option for most. But with other manufacturers like HP and Brother coming out with similar ink tank systems in the coming months, it will be interesting to see what sort of impact these printers will have on the market.

Even though they've had a long history of success in the printing industry, there are still many customers that are not familiar with these great alternative printing options. In this quick article, we will explain the differences between name brand (OEM), remanufactured and compatible cartridges so you can make the best buy for your budget. Also known as "aftermarket" cartridges, LD Products has been selling remanufactured and compatible printer cartridges since 1999. New customers regularly ask us about the difference between our cartridges and the name brand cartridges that come with your printer. Here, we explore all of the most common questions, including: What are the differences between OEM, remanufactured and compatible printer cartridges? How do remanufactured and compatible cartridges compare against an OEM? Can I expect the same page yield and print quality as an OEM cartridge? Will using an aftermarket printer cartridge void my printer's warranty? What are OEM printer cartridges? OEM, or name brand cartridges are made by your printer manufacturer. These are the cartridges that come with your printer and are commonly called "OEMs" (original equipment manufacturer). OEM cartridges can be quite a bit more expensive than aftermarket cartridges due to the research and development costs that go into their production. They are known to be very reliable and are sometimes the only option available if your printer is new or uncommon. What are remanufactured printer cartridges? A remanufactured cartridge is an OEM cartridge that has been professionally cleaned, rebuilt and refilled with ink or toner by a manufacturer other than your printer. These cartridges have been used once, they are then recycled, acquired by a manufacturer and put through an extensive remanufacturing process. Remanufactured cartridges use the same shell as an OEM cartridge, so they have a similar appearance to the OEM product. To start, the cartridge is disassembled, cleaned and tested for quality. Worn or damaged internal components are replaced, the cartridge is reassembled and refilled with ink or toner. Remanufactured cartridges offer the same page yield as an OEM cartridge, getting you comparable prints for a better overall value. Why the difference in cost? Simply put, they do not require as many new components to create a finished, working product. By using the original shell and most of the original internal parts, manufacturing costs remain low. Remanufactured cartridges are an environmental friendly option too, preventing one less cartridge from entering the landfill. What are compatible printer cartridges? A compatible cartridge is a brand new printer cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer. These cartridges have never been used before and are uniquely designed to differentiate from the OEM cartridge they are based on. Despite any structural differences, they are designed to fit perfectly in your machine and print the same number of pages, just like the OEM cartridge. It is similar to buying the generic version of a OEM product. Compatible cartridge manufacturers can keep costs low because they don't have to worry about the same research and development costs or firmware updates that OEM manufacturers deal with, passing the savings onto the customer. Can I expect the same reliability as an OEM printer cartridge? Yes, you can expect the same reliability as an OEM cartridge, as long as you buy from a reputable manufacturer. There is a lot of competition in the aftermarket printer cartridge industry and with that, you get varying degrees of quality and reliability. To find a reliable provider, you'll want to take the time to do some research. A high number of positive reviews and a strong product guarantee are two surefire signs of a solid manufacturer. LD Products is a great option. We have been selling thousands of our own LD brand aftermarket cartridges for close to twenty years and we cover almost every printer model on the market. Our cartridges earn consistently high reviews from customers and best of all, they are all backed by an industry-best lifetime guarantee. Can I expect the same page yield and print quality as an OEM printer cartridge? Yes, aftermarket cartridges from a trusted manufacturer like LD Products will print the quoted page yield and offer a similar print quality as an OEM cartridge. All LD brand cartridges go through an intensive quality and reliability test to ensure you receive a reliable product. We fill all of our cartridges to the printer manufacturer recommended ink levels so you get the same number of prints, as based on ISO/IEC 24711 specifications.

At LD Products, all of our cartridges comes with a lifetime guarantee, so you can shop with peace of mind. Read more about it here. Will using an aftermarket cartridge void my printer's warranty? Your printer warranty cannot be voided if you decide to use an aftermarket printer cartridge. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act protects your rights as a consumer to install remanufactured and compatible cartridges in your machine. No company, associate, salesperson, or service technician can deny you service or a refund that would otherwise be covered under a warranty program simply because you use a compatible product.

Here, we will show you how to change both in just a few simple steps. The installation process can be different across printer models and consumables. To make it easy, we've included installation steps for a handful of the most popular Brother cartridges and drum units. Before we jump into specifics, let's cover the basics of a Brother toner cartridge and drum unit. The toner cartridge contains the toner powder that creates the text and images on a sheet of paper. The drum unit is an electrically charged cylinder that transfers that toner powder to paper, and both components are needed to operate your printer. Brother sells the toner cartridge and drum unit separately. The cartridge is designed to fit into the drum and they install together as one unit into your printer. Brother offers most of their toner cartridges in a standard yield and high yield cartridge size. Some printers might also accept an extra high yield option too, depending on the printer model. High yield and extra high yield cartridges print more pages but generally cost a bit more than the standard version. The drum unit is available in just one size and works with any cartridge size, as long as the cartridge is compatible with your printer. The toner cartridge is always the first to go but both consumables eventually need to be replaced. When do I change a toner cartridge? A toner cartridge needs to be changed after reaching the quoted page yield, or the approximate number of pages you can print with a specific cartridge. Page yield information is typically available on the side of the cartridge box or on the specifications page of the printer manufacturer's website. Printers are designed to track the page yield automatically and your machine will let you know to replace the toner with a "replace toner" message on the printer display. When do I change a drum unit? The drum unit lasts longer than a single toner cartridge and generally needs to be replaced after the use of 3-4 toners. Brother keeps track of the drum life by counting the number of rotations of the drum. When a drum reaches the predetermined rotation limit to the related page yield, a "drum life end soon" message will appear on your printer's display. If you are installing a new drum unit for the first time, you will need to reset the drum counter to restart the rotation count on your printer. Now that you know the basics, we'll breakdown the installation steps for a number of popular toner and drum unit combinations, and show you how to reset the drum counter too!

Each color may have its own individual ink tank or one ink tank can contain multiple colors but the printheads will always be separate. The ink tank feeds its liquid ink down to the separate printhead inside the printer which in turn dispenses the ink in the form of droplets onto the page to form text or images. Sometimes, the ink tank sits directly on top of and directly feeds into the printhead, such as with Epson and Canon Printers. Other times, one printhead may be shared by multiple colors or the cartridge may sit offset from the printhead and the ink feeds to the printhead via tubes or channels, such as with some HP printers. The Technology Behind It The Ink Tank The ink tank acts as a reservoir of ink for the printhead. A good analogy would be the ink tank would be the gas tank that stores and feeds gas (ink) to the engine (the printhead). How does it work? The ink tank will have a nozzle at the bottom or side from which the printer will pull ink from. Sometimes this nozzle can be punctured by a syringe-like piece in the printer to vacuum the ink from the ink tank, other times the nozzle on the ink tank is a fabric pad that the printer makes an air tight seal against to vacuum the ink out. The Separate Printhead The printhead is the engine of an inkjet printer that puts ink to paper. A printhead is the element which puts the ink to the page to form the text or image being printed. The printheads are separate from the ink tanks and can either be replaceable or built into the printer itself. How does it work? There's two common types of separate printheads are thermal printheads and piezoelectric printheads. Thermal Printheads Thermal technology uses silicon wafer heating elements to rapidly superheat and vaporize a small volume of ink. The vaporized ink expands, which in turn forces tiny droplets through the nozzle on the printhead. This is common with HP, Lexmark, and Canon printers. Piezoelectric Printheads Piezo technology applies an electric charge to a piezo electric crystal. The electric charge causes the piezo electric crystal to flex, forcing an ink droplet out the nozzle of the printhead. The piezo electric process allows more control over the shape and size of the ink droplets. Also, the ink doesn't have to be heated, which allows greater freedom in the formulation of the ink. These types of printheads are used with most Epson printers. The Ink Droplets The liquid ink is dispensed onto the page in the form of microscopic ink drops. These drops can vary in size and are finely laid together or combined on the page to form images or text. How do drops form images and text? By differentiating the size of the ink drops, combining colors, and the placement of the drops onto the paper these drops will form the image. The Ink The ink being used is liquid and can be pigment-based or dye-based ink. What's the difference? Pigment Ink Pigment-based inks are not water-soluble, although if you break open a pigment-based ink cartridge you'll see a liquid. These inks are basically small pigment spheres suspended in water. They're created by grounding chemically-based polymer resins into a small powder and then added to water. Because they're not water soluble, these inks aren't likely to smear when they come into contact with water-so they do a better job than dye-based inks of resisting both water and UV light. The color however, is not vibrant as dye based ink so normally pigment is used more often in black cartridges. With black ink, color brightness isn't as much of an issue-and the fact that pigment-based inks are more resistant to water and light than dye-based inks make them more desirable in that regard. Dye Ink Dye-based inks are water soluble, and they're made by dissolving a colorant enhanced by optical brighteners into water. The resulting colors are much brighter and more accurate than what you'll get with pigment-based inks. However, dye-based inks do tend to fade much more quickly in the sun and have a shorter shelf life overall than pigment-based inks do. Since dye-based ink is water soluble, it's also more likely to smear if it comes into contact with water-even if it's already dried on the page. Pros and Cons of an Ink Tank and Separate Printhead Setup Ink tanks are generally cheaper than cartridges with integrated printheads as you are only replacing the ink itself rather than the ink and printhead unit as one. Colors can also be made into individual tanks so that when a color is depleted, only that color ink tank will need replacing. However, with the printhead separate the printhead will need to be maintained. Sometimes, certain printers have the printhead permanently built in so the printhead is not replaceable if there is a problem. Need new ink cartridges?

Four HP 952 set up cartridges in black, cyan, magenta and yellow are included with the printer. Starter cartridges contain a limited amount of ink so frequent printers will likely need to order a replacement set of ink relatively quickly. Luckily, each cartridge can be replaced as needed, which should help space out replacement costs over time. In this article, we will cover the installation steps of the magenta cartridge. For a quick demonstration, check out our video below. Continue reading for step-by-step instructions. Cartridge Options HP offers the cartridge series in a standard yield and high yield size. The 952XL high yield cartridges are a better bet for those that print regularly due to their higher ink capacity. A standard black cartridge, for example, prints 1,000 pages and the high yield option prints 2,000 pages. The standard color HP 952 cartridges yield up to 700 pages. Each high yield color HP 952XL yield up to 1,600 pages. For a detailed look at the compatible list of printers, see our list below: How to Check the Ink Levels Your printer will inform you on the display screen when a cartridge needs to be replaced. If you want to double check your ink levels or see if other cartridges are also running low, you can pull up the "Estimated Cartridge Levels" menu on the display. 1. To get there, first, touch the small wheel in the top left corner of the screen. 2. Scroll to "Cartridge Information," then select "Estimated Cartridge Levels." This will pull up a display showing you the estimated cartridge ink levels. Installing a New HP 952 Magenta Cartridge 1. Open up the front of the printer by pulling the latch on the left hand side. 2. Wait for the cartridges to center. Press the magenta cartridge with your fingertip to remove it. Once it is loose, gently pull it out of its slot. 3. Open up the new cartridge and remove the plastic wrap the cartridge came in. Once it is unwrapped, you can immediately install the magenta cartridge. 4. Slide the cartridge into the slot with your fingertip and let it click into place. 5. Close up the printer door. 6. The printer will display a "Genuine Cartridge Installed" message if you installed an original HP cartridge. Now you are ready to print!

In this short guide we will review the installation process for the Canon PIXMA TR8520 and touch on a few important cartridge features too. Let's start by taking a closer look at the cartridges. Cartridge Specs Canon offers six cartridges for this series, the PGI-280 black and CLI-281 cyan, magenta, yellow, photo black and photo blue. The TS8120 and TS9120 printers are the only machines in the series that use the photo blue ink cartridge. The rest of the above-mentioned cartridges are required in every printer. Cartridges are sold in a standard yield, high yield (XL) or extra high yield (XXL) cartridge size. The higher yield cartridges are a better overall value in the long term if you print frequently, as they are filled with more ink. Keep in mind that the black and photo black cartridge are not interchangeable. The PGI-280 black cartridge is a much larger cartridge compared to the CLI-281 photo black and uses pigment ink to print black and white text. The photo black cartridge is the same size as the other CLI-281 cartridges in the series and uses dye-based ink to produce more defined shades of black in your photos. To cut down on printing costs, consider buying alternative Canon PGI-280XL and Canon CLI-281XL compatible ink cartridges by LD Products.

We recommend consulting your specific printer's user guide if you own a different printer model, however, the steps should be similar across PIXMA "TR" and "TS" machines. Lift up the entire scanner unit and wait for the carriage to center. You can take out the cartridge you need to replace by gently pulling it up and out from the printer. A message will appear on your printer's display saying you can replace the cartridge. Take your new cartridge out of the box. Then, remove the orange tape on the top of the cartridge by gentling pulling up. This will expose the vent hole on the cartridge so it can work properly in your machine. Remove orange clip on the bottom of the cartridge. This clip protects the cartridge while it's in transit and the cartridge will not fit into the printer if you leave this on. It should come off with a twist. Install the new cartridge in your machine. Double check to make sure you are installing the cartridge. The "BK" on the cartridge should line up with the "BK" in the machine. Line it up with the carriage in the machine and gently press on it so that it clicks in place. Close up the front cover and you are ready to start printing! We hope you've found this installation guide useful!

Keep reading to learn more about the series. HP 64 Cartridge Specs HP 64 ink cartridges come in black and tri-color. Magenta, cyan and yellow ink are all included in the tri-color cartridge, so if you run low on a particular color you'll have to replace the entire cartridge. Cartridges are sold in two sizes: standard yield and high yield. High yield, or XL cartridges are slightly more expensive, but their high ink capacity make them a better overall value. The black cartridge contains pigment-based ink and the tri-color cartridge contains dye-based ink. Pigment-based ink dries quickly, making it a solid ink option for text heavy prints. Dye-based ink is a bit more susceptible to smudging but can produce a great color photo.

The Epson 202 cartridge series is new to market, currently working in just two printers, the Epson Workforce WF-2860 All-in-One and the Epson Expression XP-5100 Small-in-One. Designed for small offices and families, both of these machines offer quality color prints at fast print speeds, making them the perfect printer companion for any home work space. Here, we cover the cartridge specs, show you how to check the cartridge ink levels and cover installation so you can confidently care for your new printer. Let's get started! Jump directly to our Epson 202 cartridge installation video directly below. Or, continue reading to learn more about the cartridge series and it's compatible printers! Cartridge Specs Epson sells the 202 cartridge series in two different sizes, a standard yield and high yield (or XL) cartridge size. You will need to replace four separate cartridges (black, cyan, magenta and yellow), and individual cartridges can be replaced as needed. Standard yield cartridges are the cheaper of the two, but you won't get as many prints from them as they contain less ink. Customers with frequent printing habits are better off paying a bit more for the high yield cartridge, which offers a better long-term value compared to the standard yield. If you are tired of overpaying for cartridges, consider buying the LD brand compatible version of the 202XL high yield cartridges, which prints the same number of high quality pages for a fraction of the cost. You can find the LD Products compatible version here!

You can do this by tapping the ink drop icon, which will bring up the current cartridge levels. If one of your cartridges is running low, select "next" and then select the "replace cartridges" button to start the replacement process. Then select "next," and "start." How to Replace Epson 202 Ink Cartridges First, check the cartridge levels on your printer's display. In our example, we will be replacing the Epson 202 cyan ink cartridge. Select "next" and then select "replace cartridges" on the display screen to start the replacement process. To replace, lift the entire scanner unit up and wait for the carriage to center. Gently pull up on the depleted cartridge to remove. It should pop up and easily remove with a little shaking motion. Take the new cartridge out of its packaging. You will also want to remove the piece of yellow tape on the top of the cartridge. This will expose the vent hole on the cartridge so it can work properly in your machine. Now you are ready to install! Double check to make sure you are installing the cartridge. The "C" on the cartridge should line up with the "C" in the machine. Line the cartridge up with the carriage in the machine and gently press on it so that it clicks in place. Close up the top cover and select "Completed" on the LCD display. We hope you've found this installation guide informative! If you have any questions about the installation process or about your Epson 202 ink cartridges, drop us a line, we'd be happy to help!

With a bit of inventory monitoring online shopping, it's easy to keep costs low and your budget intact. We've compiled a list of savvy office supply shopping tips so your business can start saving right away. Regularly keep track of inventory. Going to the store without first going over your current inventory of office supplies is an inefficient way to restock your office. Create a game plan before you step out the door, and map out what you need for at least the next month. If you don't want to make supply shopping a monthly routine, consider planning on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. New office owners should shop conservative--it's easier to get more later. Shop around online before you buy. Online shopping has made it easier than ever to compare prices on dozens of items with the click of a mouse. If your company doesn't already have an established supplier, look around and gather quotes from a range of potential suitors before you lock yourself in with a particular contract. Be on the lookout for specials. For the occasional one-off item, double check to see if any retailers are running specials or sales. If you have an established relationship with a retailer, check for discounts available for regular customers, especially those who purchase in bulk. Buy in bulk. Retailers incentivize bulk purchasing for nearly everything, and stocking up on commonly used goods is a smart way to cut down on costs. Make a list of the items you buy the most and ask your supplier if they offer any bulk purchase options. If a bulk pack doesn't already exist, they might be able to create a custom bulk set just for your business. Buy generic. Generic brands are a simple way to save and in most cases, the differences in quality are negligible. Buying generic is especially smart when shopping for pricier items, like furniture and printer cartridge consumables. For example, generic ink cartridges for desktop inkjet and laser printers often cost half as much as name brand items with little or no noticeable difference in print quality. Factor in shipping costs. Shipping costs can vary from supplier to supplier. Some companies offer free shipping after you reach a certain dollar threshold and others base shipping off the weight of the product. Delivery for over-sized items may end up costing hundreds of dollars if you're not careful-so be sure to check shipping terms and conditions before you place your next order. Reuse and recycle. Is outdated technology cluttering up your supply cabinet? There are many companies that offer cash back for used technology, including laptops, tablets, smartphones, printer cartridges. We recommend checking out earth911.com, they offer recycling solutions for a wide range of technology supplies and their recycling location finder is a great way track down the right facility closest to your business. Stocking your small business is easy to monitor with a little planning. Buying smart and only buying what you need are the first steps. Once you've got a handle on that, there's a whole wonderful world of savings you can experiment with! Need new ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

If you are installing a new cartridge for the first time, of course you want to make sure you do it right! In this article, we will be covering the installation process of two popular printer models, the Canon Pixma® MG2520 and Pixma® MX922. Let's get started! How to Replace a Canon PIXMA MG2520 Ink Cartridge The Canon Pixma MG2520 is a compact all-in-one machine that is easy to set up and wireless ready. It requires two separate ink cartridges - one for black and one for color. Canon offers both cartridges in a high yield and standard yield option. The high yield is slightly more expensive but holds significantly more ink. Replacements for Pixma MG2520 ink cartridges are priced at $25.99 each for a black cartridge (which prints up to 300 pages) and $29.99 for color cartridges (which print up to 180 pages) if you buy original Canon cartridges. Compatible LD brand replacements for the Pixma MG2520 offer the same amount of ink for considerably less at $21.99 each per black cartridge and $23.99 per color cartridge.

Retract the output paper tray and extensionFirst, you'll need to set up the printer in preparation to print. If the tray that catches the paper is pulled out, slide it back into the printer so it is flush with the printer. #2. Open the cover To expose your printer's cartridge carrier, you will need to open up the front cover, which is located above the paper tray that you just slid in. You should see a finger print indentation at the top of the cover, which you will need to push in (DO NOT pull it down as this may damage the unit). Allow the flap to come down, and you will notice the ink cartridge holder automatically move to the center of the printer. #3. Remove your Canon printer's old cartridges To remove the old cartridges, use your thumb and index finger to gently wiggle them out of their slots. Be sure to remove each cartridge one at a time and make a note of which color is being removed from each respective slot. #4. Insert the new Canon ink cartridges Before you install the new cartridges, you will need to remove each cartridge from their packaging. We recommend opening up new cartridges over a trash can…sometimes ink can emit from the cartridge when it is being unwrapped. Pull the plastic tab from each cartridges' to expose their nozzles. Slide each cartridge into their respective slot. Make sure you insert them nozzle first and label up, with a firm push upwards until it clicks into place. The cartridges should be secure before you close the lid. Once the lid is closed, the printer's ON light in the top left corner will flash green for about a minute before staying lit. #5. Test your cartridges The test print is an important final step before you can start printing regularly. Turn on your desktop, bring up a document, press print, take a look at the results and you'll soon be able to see if the ink is printing the way it should. Please note, if the ink comes out streaky or smudgy, consult your Canon printer manual to check how to realign the printer heads. If the triangular emblem in the top left corner is flashing orange, the cartridges may not be seated properly. Re-open your printer and check the cartridges are installed correctly by giving them a push. How to Change a Remanufactured Canon PG-245 or CL-246 Cartridge: The installation process of a remanufactured cartridge is very similar to installing an original cartridge, but there a couple of minor tweaks you will need to make in order to get the cartridge to work. Most remanufactured versions of the PG-245 and CL-246 series do not recognize in your printer like a genuine product would, but they will still work with a bit of simple tinkering. If you buy a remanufactured cartridge and you get an error message upon installation, follow these easy steps to get your printer up and running! You might see an error message saying your recently installed cartridge is "low" or "empty". This of course is not true, you should have a perfectly good, fully functioning cartridge in your hands! So why the low message? The printer is still reading the information on the chip from the last time the cartridge was in use. Since then it has been refurbished and refilled with ink, but the chip has not been replaced. To get the cartridge working you need to force the machine to override that error message and accept the cartridge as is. The first thing you are going to want to do is take the cartridge out again and clean the chip, or gold contact, with a lint free cloth or Q-tip. Gently wipe the contact with the Q-tip a few times. The chip on an ink cartridge is very sensitive. Sometimes residue can get on the chip and produce an error on your machine. Next, we are going to want to reset the printer. To do this, power down the machine, unplug the power cord from the wall for 15 seconds. Plug it back in and turn the printer back on. Wait for the printer to initialize and then reinstall your recently cleaned cartridge. If you clean the chip, install the cartridge again and you are still getting an error message, do not lose hope! You can easily override the error message by pressing and holding down the Stop/Reset button on the printer for a full 15 seconds. It may say "please wait a while" on your printer's screen and your printer should go through a startup sequence. Once the startup sequence is complete you should be able to print as expected! After overriding the error message the printer will continue to use the cartridge without stopping due to the ink level being low or empty. You will not be able to tell how much ink is left in your cartridge. However, the cartridge is filled to capacity and you should get the same number of prints as an original! How to Replace a Canon PIXMA MX922 Cartridge Another reliable offering from Canon's wireless all-in-one range, this compact print offers quality photo prints and a decent shelf life. The PIXMA MX922 requires five separate cartridges (two black and three color) which should be inserted in the machine in the following order: Magenta ink (M) Black ink (BK) Yellow ink (Y) Pigment black (PGBK) Cyan ink (C) The installation order can differ from model to model, but most Canon printers include color-coded labels beneath the cartridge carriage. The Pixma MX922 series offers a high yield and standard yield cartridge. The pigment black is also offered as an extra high yield. High yield cartridges are slightly more expensive but are generally a better deal in the long term if you print in high volumes. You will need both black cartridges (the pigment black and photo black) in order for your printer to function properly. The pigment black cartridge is designed for printing text while the photo black's specialty is obviously, photographs.

Lift the operation panel First, lift the operation panel with both hands. This is on hinges and lifts up like a lid; raise the panel placing your hands at the join just beneath the LCD screen. #2. Remove the old cartridges Wait for the old cartridges to move to the center of the printer. Then, carefully push the tab located at the end of each cartridge and pull them out. #3. Remove the packaging of the replacement cartridges and insert them New cartridges have been known to leak a bit when you remove the packaging. We recommend opening up new cartridges over a trash can…sometimes ink can emit from the cartridge when it is being unwrapped. Once the wrapping is removed, the tape is pulled and the orange clip is twisted off, you are ready to install. Insert each cartridge into the printer, following the color key below the carriage. Make sure the labels are facing upwards, then push them down until you hear a click. Once they are in place, a red light will appear on the cartridge confirming that they are secure. Close up the panel and you are all set. #4. Run an ink test Once you've replaced your Canon printer ink cartridges, run a quick print test to make sure everything is working correctly. If the ink comes out streaky or smudgy, check your Canon printer manual to check how to re-align the printheads. We hope this guide was helpful!

If you are in the market for a new machine, Brother® monochrome printers are a great choice due to their dependability and low operating cost. Every Brother monochrome printer includes a black and white toner cartridge that provides crisp reliable prints at a reasonable price. In this article we will be skipping the printer conversation and focus on solely on the cartridges themselves. From installation to output, we will go over all the ways these types of cartridges are related (and some ways they aren't) so you can know exactly what you are working with! Brother Monochrome Toner Basics First, we will introduce you to the cartridge basics. Each series mentioned here includes a standard yield and high yield cartridge option (we list the standard yield cartridge number first, followed by their high yield counterpart). The term high yield is used to describe cartridges that contain more ink. If you are using a high yield cartridge you will get more prints due to the higher ink capacity. The moderately filled standard cartridge is the most common option however, producing a smaller number of prints than the high yield. Consumers that only print on occasion will be happy investing in these less expensive cartridges, but if you print frequently, it's probably better to go for the high yield. For example, the standard yield TN-420 offers a yield of 1,200 pages, while the high yield TN-450 offers 2,600 pages. Compatible versions of the Brother brand are worth considering if you are looking to save some cash. Here's a list of top Brother toner cartridges with a list of printers they are compatible with. Brother TN420 / TN450 Series Brother TN530 / TN560 Series Brother TN540 / TN570 Series Brother TN550 / TN580 Series Brother TN620 / TN650 Series Brother TN630 / TN660 Series Brother TN720 / TN750 Series Brother TN820 / TN850 Series Installing Brother Toner Cartridges The toner installation process varies from machine to machine, but the basic mechanics are essentially the same. Every toner cartridge has a page yield that determines the average life of the toner cartridge based on 5% page coverage. Your printer will remind you when it's time to replace your toner cartridge by displaying: "Toner Low" on the LCD screen. To replace your toner, follow these easy steps: Before installing a new cartridge, remove the protective covering that surrounds the toner. This cover protects the cartridge during shipment and the toner will not fit properly if it is still attached. Gently shake the cartridge back and forth a couple of times to redistribute the toner powder. A small amount of toner may emit from the cartridge, so be sure you do this over a trash can to avoid a mess. Every Brother toner cartridge fits into a drum unit. The drum unit sort of looks like a tray and you will need to remove it from your printer in order to install the cartridge. Other major printer brands like HP and Canon sell their cartridges with the drum unit built into the toner but Brother sells them as two separate consumables. The toner cartridge should click into the drum unit easily. Make sure it is locked in securely, otherwise it will not fit into your machine. Clean the corona wire located on top of the drum unit by sliding the small tab from right to left a few times. Put the toner and drum back into the printer (they should now be one combined unit) and close the front cover. You can also watch a quick video on the installation process here: Replacing Your Drum A drum unit works together with your toner to transfer images onto a page. Drum cartridges do not need to be replaced as often as toners. The general rule of thumb is usually after going through 3 or 4 toners. Your printer's display should read "Replace Parts Drum", when it's getting close the end of the drum life. You might be able to prolong the replacement of your drum by cleaning the corona wire (see more on that below) or by removing the cartridge and gently rocking it back and forth a few times to redistribute the toner powder. If those suggestions do not seem to improve the situation, follow these steps for the proper replacement process: Open the front cover of your machine and remove the drum unit and toner cartridge assembly. Pull the blue lock lever to remove the toner from the drum. Remove the new drum unit from its packaging Click the toner into the new drum, it should firmly lock into place. Slide the complete unit back into the printer Do not close the front cover yet. First, you'll need to inform your printer that you are installing a new drum. This resets the counter on your drum unit so it is able to once again keep track of its expected lifespan. The instructions on this will vary depending on what printer you have, so you will want to consult your specific manual for the appropriate steps. We've reviewed the proper replacement instructions of the popular Brother MFC-8680DN printer, just to give you an idea of the process, but every printer is a little bit different: Inform your printer by pressing the "Clear/Back" button on the machine. This prompts the display to bring up the message: Replace Drum? Yes. No. Confirm you are placing the drum by pressing "1" on your printer's console. Close up the front cover and you should be ready to print! Resetting the Toner Life If you recently installed a new cartridge and you are still getting a "Toner Low" message on your machine, you might need to manually reset the toner life. Occasionally when you replace a Brother toner the built in page counter, or what Brother calls the "toner life," will still need to be reset. Bes sure to research the appropriate steps for your specific printer, since the steps vary a bit from machine to machine. To reset the toner life of a Brother HL-2270DW, follow these steps: Open the front cover and leave open while completing the following steps. Turn the printer off. Hold the 'go' button while turning the printer on. All lights should be on. Release the 'go' button (or "start' button). Press the 'go' button (or "start' button) 2 times. Pause. All panel lights should be on. Press the 'go' button (or "start' button) 5 times The toner light should be off. (error may be flashing) The paper light should be on or flashing. Close cover. The ready light should be the only light on. Print Quality Issues Print quality issues can happen from time to time and are generally easily remedied by simply removing the toner from your printer and gently rocking it back and forth to redistribute the toner powder (Make sure you do it over a trash can to avoid a potential mess!). You can also try cleaning the corona wire on the drum by sliding the green tab from right to left a few times. If you complete these troubleshooting steps and still aren't getting the quality you want, it might be time to replace either the toner or the drum. The toner's page yield should give you an idea of how many prints to expect from each cartridge and the drum should be replaced after every three or four toners. Your printer typically does alert you when it's time to make the change. Streaky prints may also be caused by your drum, and a simple drum cleaning will likely resolve the problem. To do this, carefully remove it from the printer. Place it on a flat surface with a paper towel underneath to prevent toner from spilling onto your desk or carpet. Gently wipe the drum roller with a dry, lint-free cloth. Make sure you do not touch the drum; it is very sensitive! Drum Not Fitting For Brother monochrome printers specifically, the drum unit is a separate item from the toner cartridge and must be re-used. If the cartridge is not fitting or is too small, then you may not be installing the cartridge into the separate drum unit. Double check to make sure you have separated the old drum unit from the old toner cartridge and are re-using the drum unit with the new toner. Brother's monochrome printers are incredibly reliable and can go a long way if cared for properly. Regular upkeep and maintenance is paramount to ensure your printer continues to operate at peak performance. Many of the troubleshooting advice mentioned is universal across all Brother monochrome machines, so if you own more than one, you are well on your way to becoming a troubleshooting expert.

In this short guide, we'll give a brief overview of the printer, review cartridge specs and cover installation steps. Let's get started! Printer and Cartridge Specs The Workforce Pro 4720 features easy to use print, copy, scan and fax features. Designed for 5-10 users, the machine is wireless ready, making printing from anywhere quick and convenient. Epson 802 ink cartridges are available in both a standard yield and high yield, or XL cartridge size. Frequent printers are better off choosing the high yield cartridge option, as it offers more ink at a better value. The cartridges are sold in black, cyan, magenta and yellow. Each color contains pigment-based ink and can be replaced as need. Cartridge replacement can get expensive. If you are looking to save money, consider buying LD Products brand compatible Epson 802XL ink cartridges. We offer a compatible black 802 standard yield cartridge for $19.99 and high yield versions of the color cartridges for $19.99 a piece! A high yield option for the black cartridge will be available soon. Replacing an Epson 802 Ink Cartridge in Your Workforce Pro WF-4720 Before you replace, confirm which cartridge is running low! Select the "home" button on your printer's display. You'll notice there is a small exclamation point covering the ink drop symbol on the home display screen. This is an indicator that one of your cartridges is running low. Touch the ink droplet to view the supply status of the cartridges, in our example we will be replacing the cyan cartridge. Start the replacement process by selecting "Maintenance">"Ink cartridge replacement">"Next"> and "Start". Carefully lift up the entire scanner unit and wait for the carriage to center. You can take out the cartridge you need to replace by gently squeezing the tab and lifting up and out from the printer. Open up your brand new cyan cartridge. I like to prep new cartridges over a trashcan because sometimes a little bit of ink can escape when I am unwrapping them. The first thing you will want to remove the orange tape on the bottom of the cartridge. Gently pull on the tape to remove, this will expose the vent hole on the cartridge so it can work properly in your machine. Be sure to avoid touching the gold contact chip when handling the new cartridge. This chip is very sensitive and it may not read properly if residue or fingerprint oil gets on those contact points. Install the cyan cartridge. The "C" on the cartridge should line up with the "C" in the machine. When we tried installing this cartridge, we noticed that the cartridge fit seemed a bit snug. This is normal, the cartridge should fit as expected, just line it up in the slot and gently press on it so that it clicks in place. Close up the top cover and we are ready to start printing.

HP® is just one of many companies nowadays jumping on the subscription bandwagon, and with Instant Ink®, they are reinventing the way you buy ink. Instead of replacing a cartridge when your ink runs out, you are paying to print a set amount of pages each month. HP offers a few different price options, depending on how often you print. The occasional plan is offered at $2.99, giving you 50 prints a month. The moderate plan goes for $4.99, giving you 100 prints per month. And the frequent plan is $9.99, giving you 300 prints per month. Judging on price alone, the instant ink program is an affordable option for many consumers. But if you factor in the fine print, dealing with Instant Ink's rules and regulations may outweigh the convenience of a low monthly cost. A printed page may not be what you expect. Under instant ink's terms, a printed page is "a page upon which any amount ink of is placed by your printer" 2 . This means, if you print a page with just one line of text on it, it will count toward your monthly print total. Customers may be inclined to be more mindful of their printing habits if they have to consider the cost of every page. Unexpected prints or typos might add up fast, especially for customers that are on a budget. Consider the possibility of overage fees. If you do end up going your allotted monthly amount, the cost of your subscription may start to add up. HP charges 1 $1 per 15 pages on the occasional plan, $1 per 20 pages on the moderate plan and $1 per 25 pages on the frequent plan. The occasional overage fee may not be a deal breaker for most customers but that extra expense can tally up fast if you have a major print job to complete. To get around paying the overage fee, you might want to consider having a set of back up cartridges on hand. Regular (non-instant ink ready) back up cartridges will let you continue printing without having to worry about incurring additional fees. HP might monitor some of your information. When you sign up for the instant ink program, you are authorizing HP 2 to remotely monitor page count, ink levels, the type of documents you print, the type of device you use to print a particular document and whether the last cartridge you used was new or used. They are also allowed to share some of your information 2 (name, address, email, printer model) with the retailer that you purchased the subscription from. Replacement cartridges may take up to 10 days to arrive. HP instant ink cartridges are shipped standard and may take up to 10 days to arrive, for some. However, for most customers, it probably won't take that long. When tested, an order of instant ink cartridges arrived relatively quickly. HP sent an email notification stating that a new set of cartridges were being shipped out on Friday and they were received the following Wednesday. Instant ink keeps track of the amount of ink your machine, so it can anticipate when it should ship out a replacement set of cartridges to you. HP estimates this based on when your cartridges have enough ink to "print twice as much as the number of average pages in your monthly plan" 1 . This works well for customers that print occasionally, and shipping time probably won't be an issue. But if you are in the middle of a high volume print job with a tight deadline, you may not be able to afford to wait. For those that are in a rush, HP does offer expedited shipping for an additional charge. Unused prints will rollover to the next month, up to a certain point Rollover prints are baked into each plan, but the number of rollover pages you can accrue varies, depending on what plan you are enrolled in. The occasional plan offers a maximum of 50 rollover pages 3 in your account at a time, the moderate plan allows for up 100 rollover pages per account and the frequent plan offers up to 300 rollover pages. If you don't need to print for a couple of months, the number of rollover pages will be capped. In order for instant ink to accurately monitor cartridge use, your printer must be connected to the internet. HP's Instant Ink cartridges are set up to communicate with your printer in order to accurately track 4 page usage and ink levels. Cartridges will only communicate with the printer when it's connected to the internet, so if your internet connection is bad, it won't be able to properly record your total page count. You can still print when it's not connected to the internet, but the page tracker will not be count the printed pages until there is a connection. This delay might be a problem for Instant Ink customers if they run a big print job offline, reach their monthly page limit and need a replacement cartridge right away. If the connection isn't able to monitor how many pages you have left in real time, the program might not be able to anticipate when to ship out a new cartridge. Instant Ink only works with certain printers. There are only a select number of newer model HP machines 5 that are instant ink ready. If you've got an older model HP printer, you will need to upgrade in order to enroll in a plan. Printer price can vary depending on what sort of printer you are in the market for, ranging anywhere between $70 to $380. Forget to pay your Instant Ink bill and HP just might shut off access to the service. Just like an electric bill or gas bill, instant ink is a monthly service you need to stay on top of in order to take advantage of it. If you don't stay current, HP has the option to temporarily shut down access 2 to the service and your Instant Ink cartridges. Since Instant Ink relies on an active account to report ink levels, a delay in payment might also delay the shipping time of a badly needed replacement cartridge. Instant ink is a different way to look at the way we print. The low monthly price point is very inviting for many consumers, and makes sense for people that only print a few times each month. But for customers that have a fixed budget, the extra fees that come along with extra prints might be a cause for concern. No matter where you stand, factors like a monthly bill, connectivity concerns, and overage fees are worth keeping in mind. Instant ink isn't the only inexpensive printing option on the market. Compatible cartridges are incredibly affordable and they offer the freedom of being able to print what you need, without worrying about overage fees. Now that you a have a better idea of what to expect with Instant Ink, the choice is yours. Need new ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

Deciding between an inkjet or laser printer is the first decision most customers will make in the buying process and with this this guide, we'll break down the pros and cons of both, so you can shop for your next machine with confidence. To put it simply, inkjet printers have been the traditional choice of home users, whereas laser printers are typically found in offices. Most inkjet printers generally have a low startup cost, are compact and can print both text-based documents and high quality color documents, including photos. Alternatively, laser printers offer a lower cost per page, faster print speeds and involve a lower total cost of ownership. To help you make a more educated decision, let's dive into the specifics of both types of machines. Printer Use What will you use the printer for? If you're looking for a home printer that for the occasional printing of colored as well as black and white documents, get an inkjet printer. Laser printers, on the other hand, were designed for the office use and can handle large quantities of black and white documents everyday. Some laser printers also print in color but if you're looking to print high resolution photos, go with an inkjet printer. Technology (How They Work) Inkjet printers spray ink through microscopic nozzles onto paper while laser printers have a drum unit that fuses toner powder onto paper with heat. Due to these differences in technology, laser printers will typically have a faster print speed since it takes less effort to put toner on the page. Print Quality Print quality varies, depending on the types of prints you need. If photography is your thing, inkjet printers are the way to go. If your business regularly prints documents, a laser printer will fit the bill. A common perception is that inkjet printers are better with colored images, and laser printers are best for black and white. Although inkjets printers still have the edge when it comes to photo prints, color laser technology has improved substantially and many printers can hold their own. Print Speed Laser printers are build for the office and are engineered to print anywhere between 15 to 100 pages per minute (ppm) depending on the model. Inkjet printers print slower at an average of 16 ppm, allowing for crisp, detailed photo prints. Print Volume Print volume refers to how much your printer can print at a given time. Most laser printers can print a large amount of documents in a short amount of time. Since most inkjet printers are intended for home use, the print volume is typically much smaller. For comparison, let's take a look at the HP LaserJet Pro M401n's print volume and speed alongside the Canon's inkjet PIXMA MX922. HP LaserJet Pro M401n Canon PIXMA MX922 (Inkjet) Pages Per Minute 35 ppm 7 ppm Monthly Print Volume 750 - 3,000 pages 250 - 500 pages Notice the stark difference between the print speed and print volume between the two printer types. Printer & Cartridge Cost The upfront cost of a laser printer may seem like its biggest weakness. After all, inkjet printers have a much lower upfront cost with some models priced as low as $29.99 while heavy-duty laser printers can quickly get into the hundreds of dollars. The higher upfront cost can often times pay for itself over time when you factor in the price and capability of the machine's cartridges. Cartridge prices for a laser and inkjet printer also widely differ--in fact, much more so than printer cost--but for good reason. Laser printer cartridges, also known as toner cartridges, can print significantly more pages than most inkjet cartridges. To illustrate this, we will use the two printers we mentioned previously as an example. The HP LaserJet M401n uses the HP 80X high yield toner cartridge and prints up to 6,900 pages while the Canon MX922 inkjet printer uses the Canon PGI-250XL high yield ink cartridge and prints at least 500 pages. 6,900 pages vs 500 pages is a big difference! An HP 80X cartridge costs $187.99*and the Canon PGI-250XL cartridge currently costs around $45.98. Although the HP toner is priced 75% more than the Canon cartridge, since you get 92% more pages out of the toner, the HP laser cartridge has a more economical cost per page. Check out the table below. HP LaserJet Pro M401n Canon PIXMA MX922 (Inkjet) Cartridge HP 80x Canon PGI-250XL Page Yield 6,900 pages 500 pages Cost $187.99* $45.98 Cost per page 0.027 cents per page 0.09 cents per page The upfront cost of an inkjet printer might seem the more economical (and attractive) choice at first but when you take into account the price of ink cartridges AND how often you'll have to replace them (considering it's low page yield), the running cost of replacing cartridges will easily get much more expensive than the initial cost of the printer. On the contrary, laser printer cartridges can print more pages so it will be months or even years before you'll need replacements, again depending on how much you use your printer. For a quick a recap, we've broken down the pros and cons of both machines: Inkjet Printers PROS Inkjet printers are usually smaller and lighter - making it ideal for a bedroom or home office where space saving is valued. Great at producing photo quality prints and image-heavy documents, as inkjet printers do a better job of blending and producing vibrant colors than laser printers. The initial price of an inkjet printer is usually less than most laser printers. No warm-up time needed before printing. Can print on a variety of paper types, including glossy photo paper, textured stationery and fabrics. Ink refill kits can reduce the cost of printing. CONS: Ink is expensive, especially for users who print on a regular basis who are continually forced to repurchase more cartridges due to their low-yielding consumables. Much slower than laser printers. Low-capacity paper trays of 50 to 100 sheets, which can be frustrating for a user who prints a lot. Low monthly duty cycle (the maximum amount of prints possible in a given month without causing damage to the printer). Laser Printers PROS: Laser printers print much faster than inkjet printers. This isn't and shouldn't be a strong selling point for casual printers, but high volume users will notice a huge difference. Laser printers produce sharp text. If you're a high volume printer that only requires text documents, laser is the way to go. Higher monthly duty cycle means they are better prepared to handle high-volume jobs. A price-by-price comparison favors laser printers over inkjet printers if you print on a frequent basis and aren't producing documents that are graphically complex. CONS: Can handle simple graphics, but complex images and photos are a challenge. Although there are some compact laser printers on the market, they are generally bigger and heavier than inkjet printers. Laser printers can't handle the same variety of paper that inkjets can. Toner, on average, is cheaper in the long run for high volume printers because their higher yielding cartridges; however, the upfront cost for the printer will be more than your average inkjet printer. Deciding on whether you should go with an inkjet or laser printer all comes down to what and how much you print. It also pays to think farther down the road. Will your print needs change over time? All of these factors should be considered before you buy and taking the time to do so can potentially save you hundreds of dollars in the future. *Savings based on price comparison and printer prices listed on HP and Canon.

However, some all-in-one inkjet printers are more generous with their ink than others. Total cost of operation is important to keep in mind when looking for a new machine, especially if you plan to keep it for a number of years. In the hopes of making your printer search easier, we did some research to determine which models are the most ink efficient. HP® OfficeJet® Pro 8710 All-in-One Printer If you are looking to spend less than $150 the OfficeJet Pro 8710 is worth considering. HP OfficeJet Pro printers are some of the fastest color inkjet machines available according to the Guinness Book of World Records. This particular printer uses HP 952 ink cartridges. Standard yield cartridges are offered at $29.99 and print up to 1000 pages. High yield cartridges, a better option for offices that print frequently, are priced at $41.99 and print up to 2000 pages. HP currently sells the printer for $129.99. HP OfficeJet 7612 Wide Format e-All-in-One The HP OfficeJet 7612 is another great option and its wide format capabilities can produce prints up to 13" x 19". It is compatible with the HP 932 black ink cartridge and HP 933 cyan, magenta and yellow cartridges. HP 932 ink cartridges offer approximately 400 pages. Original high yield HP cartridges can run as much as $34.99 for the black and $17.99 for each color*. But LD Products offers compatible high yield LD brand cartridges for just $8.99 apiece. Epson® WorkForce® ET-4500 EcoTank® All-in-One Printer The EcoTank series from Epson is equipped with a continuous ink tank system, which uses a proprietary inkwell design that directly connects to the printhead. The WorkForce ET-4500 is an ideal choice for your small business and can accommodate a duty cycle of 3000 pages every month. Epson sells their ink bottles for this model at $12.99 per color which means it'll cost you $52 to get bottles for all 4 colors (black, magento, yellow, cyan). Compatible cartridges are a great affordable alternative at only $4.99 per bottle. EcoTanks are a pricier machine but may pay off in the long term if you regularly do a lot of heavy duty printing. Models start at $400. Canon® Maxify® MB5320 Wireless Small Office All-in-One It's hard to beat the Maxify MB5320's functionality and features. If you want a printer that does it all AND offers great page metrics, the Maxify MB5320 is worth looking into. Each monochrome page costs around 1.5 cents, and full-color pages total to around 7.1 cents each. The Canon MB5320 printer uses PGI-2200 cartridges which, if you buy genuine, will cost you between $32.99 to $38.99 per cartridge and print up to 1000 pages. High yield PGI-2200 cartridges (PGI-2200XL) cost $36.99 to $48.99 and print up to 1500 pages each cartridge. Compatible MB5320 printer cartridges will only cost you $9.99 to $10.99 each cartridge; a great price compared to the Canon original. Canon sells the printer for $399. Canon Maxify MB2720 Wireless Home Office All-in-One Printer If you like the Maxify series but don't want to spend $399, another popular model-the Canon Maxify MB2720. It offers similar results for a cheaper sticker price. Canon MB2720 ink cartridges are slightly cheaper than the MB5320's too. For the price of an original Canon Black PGI-1200 cartridge ($29.99), you can get almost 3 compatible high yield black PGI-1200 cartridges (PGI-1200XL) which cost only $10.99 each. Printer price: $249.99. Brother® MFC-J985DW All-in-One Inkjet One of the most efficient printers on the market the MFC-J985DW. The cheapest Brother printer that uses INKvestment cartridges, it produces monochrome prints for less than 1 cent per page. The Brother INKvestment use super high yield cartridges to deliver more prints for less. Original brand replacements for MFC-J985DW ink cartridges are priced at around $25 each for a black cartridge (which prints up to 2400 pages) and about $15 for color cartridges (which print up to 1200 pages). Compatible alternative replacements are far cheaper than the original cartridge price with black cartridge replacements (LC20EBK) at $7.99 each and color cartridges at $6.99 each (LC20EM, LC20EC, LC20EY). The printer itself is pretty affordable as well at around $199.99. Ink efficient printers are out there if you know where to look. If you print regularly, read up on the specs of the printers you are considering and do a comparison of both the features and total cost of operation. No matter which printer you choose, ink efficiency is definitely a factor that's worth considering. Need new ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

In this article, we will go over some simple tips to get the most from your cartridge so you can keep working and prolong that trip to the cartridge store. 1. Think Twice About Low or Out of Ink Warnings: If you are getting a "low ink message" on your printer's display or computer, you may not need to change out your cartridges right away. A test done by PC World found that most ink cartridges still hold anywhere from 8 to 45% of their ink when a low ink message first appears. Keep in mind that percentage differs across printer brands. Instead of immediately taking your printer's word for it, look for sure signs of low ink, like light prints or banded text. 2. Avoid Large Fonts and Bolds Large fonts and bold text can deplete your cartridge pretty quickly. You can extend the life of your cartridge by reducing the size of your text, or, consider switching to a slimmer font like Arial or New Courier. For the super thrifty, try downloading Ecofont--a font style that uses 20% less ink by including small white circles within each character. 3. Proofread Before Your Print Reprints are avoidable with a bit of simple proofreading. Get in the habit of running spell check before you print and take an extra few minutes to scan the document for typos. 4. Adjust Your Printer Settings You may not know it, but your computer has built in preferences to help you save on ink! If you are using Windows, locate the Devices and Printers section in the Control Panel. Right click on your desired printer and select Printing Preferences. From there you should be able to select one of the following recommendations, depending on your needs! Select "draft mode" to use considerably less ink. Draft mode is designed to print faster with slightly less precision in order to give you draft worthy version of your document. The quality may not be up to par compared to a regular print job, but it should suffice if you need to do a quick review. Choose "Print in Grayscale" to save your color ink! This option can help conserve those precious color cartridges by only printing your document in black and white. Select "Document Options" to print multiple pages per sheet. If you are looking to save on ink and paper, consider adjusting the formatting of your print job by printing multiple pages on one sheet. This option is great for printing out lengthy power point slides! 5. Don't Forget to Preview Before You Print! There is a reason why "print preview" is built into almost every document editor, don't forget to use it! If you are using the latest version of Microsoft Word select "File," then "Print" and your document will automatically switch to preview mode. Now you can glance at it one last time before you send it to the printer. 6. Fix streaky prints If your prints are streaking or spotty, make sure you run a printhead cleaning before swapping out for new cartridges. The printhead on a cartridge can dry up if your printer has been sitting dormant for a period. By running the cleaning feature, you can free up any dried ink, and hopefully keep your cartridges running for longer. 7. Saving Work Instead of Printing It Think before you press print! Sometimes a physical copy just isn't necessary. Before you jump the gun, consider saving a copy of your document on your phone or in the cloud. Google® Drive is a simple storage solution that is easily accessible with an internet connection. Need new ink cartridges? Shop LDProducts.com and find a great deal on printing supplies today!

With dozens of printers on the market, the printer you choose should continue to offer value as your family grows and your children get older. In this quick guide, we will cover all of the key components worth considering so you can find the best option. Start by answering a couple of basic questions about your printing expectations. Once you have your expectations laid out, continue reading to learn more about some of our favorite family friendly printers. Is it easy to use? Do I need to print in color? Do I need to make copies? How much do I want to spend on printing? Is wireless connectivity a necessity? Does it work well with social media? Best Budget All-in-One Brother® MFC-J985DW Picking a printer that keeps the family budget in mind is easy if you know what to look for. Pro-tip: factor in the total cost of operation, not just the upfront cost of the printer! Total cost of operation includes the printer price, plus the cost of replacing the cartridges and the cost of printing with those cartridges. Part of Brother's "Inkvestment" printer line, the MFC-J985DW is a great budget option, offering a large print volume for very little money. Copy, fax, scanning and wireless connectivity all come standard. The LC20E XXL cartridge series offer incredibly generous page yields at a respectable price. Brother sells the black cartridge for $23.99, which prints around 2,400 pages. Each color cartridge is $15 and prints 1,200 pages. LD brand compatible LC20E cartridges are an even better deal. At just $8.49* for the black cartridge and $7.49 per color, you can get comparable print quality to the original Brother brand for a fraction of the cost. Social Media Friendly HP® Sprocket Wireless Photo Printer Turn your digital Instagram photos into actual photos using HP's Sprocket Wireless Photo Printer. Instead of ink cartridges, the printer use HP's ZINK® Photo Paper, a special paper that applies heat activation technology to produce the color details in your prints. Capable of printing 2 x 3 inch photos or stickers from any of your preferred social media platforms, the Sprocket's photos are fun to share and print fast. HP also offers an editing app so you can add a personal touch on your photos before you print. A 20-sheet refill or the Zink photo paper goes for $9.99, making the printing costs pricey, but for the novelty, it may be worth it. Best for Heavy Duty Use Epson® WorkForce® Ecotank ET-4500 If your family prints at a high volume weekly, Epson's Ecotank ET-4500 printer is a smart buy. The printer uses four extra-large, refillable ink tanks, with the black ink tank printing up to 6,000 pages and each color tank printing around 6,500 pages. The refill process can get a bit messy, since you'll need to transfer the ink from the bottles into the tank system. Be sure to have a roll of paper towels nearby, just in case! Epson sells each bottle for $12.99 and you can find an even cheaper option from LD Products at just $4.99 per compatible. Price wise, it is a bit expensive compared to other printers in its class, but the generous cartridge yield will likely make it worthwhile for families that go through a lot ink. Best for Photos Canon® Pixma iP8720 If you have a budding photographer at home, a quality photo inkjet printer is a must-have. The Canon Pixma iP8720 Wireless Color Photo Printer is a great option and capable of printing sharp 4×6 photos in under 21 seconds. Canon sells the PGI-250XL high yield black ink cartridge for $24.99, printing approximately 500 pages. CLI-251XL color cartridges are $19.99 each and sold in six colors: black, cyan, magenta, yellow and gray. Each cartridge prints around 660 pages. Keep in mind, two different black cartridges are required for this printer; the PGI-250 black cartridge is pigment based for printing text, and the CL-251 black cartridge is a dye-based ink for photo prints. LD brand compatible cartridges are far less expensive at $6.49 each, and you can get a bundle set of 6 cartridges for $35.94! Now that you have a couple of options to choose from, you can make the best buying decision for your family. Before you settle on one, take a moment to list out all of your printing needs. Then, compare that list to your potential printer's listed features; if they match up, you have a winner! *Savings based on price comparison between remanufactured/compatible cartridge prices on www.LDProducts.com and OEM cartridge and printer prices from Staples.

Having to share a breakroom printer or copy machine can be frustrating, especially during a busy lunch hour! With so many different printer options available, it's hard to know which model will suit the needs of your students and budget. To get started, begin by answering a few basic questions: How frequently do I need to print? How much do I want to spend on ink? Is printing in color a priority? Do I need a scanner or copier built into the printer? Do I need to print wirelessly? Once you have laid out your expectations, you can determine which printers match those requirements. In this guide, we have selected a handful of the best printers for a variety of classroom types and teaching styles, and help you find one that is just right for you and your students. Black and White Prints Brother® HL-L2300D Teachers that print black and white documents regularly should seriously consider a monochrome laser printer. With a high volume print capacity and low operating cost, they are an ideal choice for a paper heavy classroom. Brother's HL-2300D is a compact, inexpensive option that prints fast (up to 27 pages per minute!). Automatic duplexing lets you easily print two-sided study guides for that upcoming economics final. Brother offers two cartridge options for the Brother HL-L2300D, the TN630 standard yield and the TN660 high yield toner. High yield toner cartridges are better for the frequent user because they hold more ink. The standard yield TN630, for example is priced at $30.49* and prints around 1,200 pages. It's high yield counterpart, the TN660 cartridge is just $15 dollars more and prints approximately 2,600 pages. The DR360 drum unit is a separate consumable for this machine, and should generally be replaced after the use of 3 or 4 toners. At $81.19, it is worth considering when you are factoring in the total cost of operating the printer. LD brand compatible replacement cartridges are an affordable alternative to the Brother brand; they offer the same standard of quality as an original Brother cartridge, for a fraction of the price. LD sells their compatible TN660 for $14.99 and the DR360 drum for $26.99! Budget Friendly All-in-One Brother® MFC-J985DW Keeping down supply costs is important for any teacher and a budget friendly printer can certainly help. Brother recently introduced their Invkestment line of color inkjet printers, a series that makes low cost printing at a priority. Featuring a set of super high-yield cartridges that offer a generous page yield, it also includes copy, scan and fax features, perfect for making a quick copy in between class periods. The Brother MFC-J985DW printer uses four super high yield LC20E ink cartridges, with the black cartridge offering 2,400 pages per cartridge and each color cartridge offering 1,200 pages apiece. Brother sells the black cartridge for $23.49 and $14.99 per color. LD brand compatible cartridges are a great deal cheaper, at $8.49 for the black and $7.49 for each color. Photo Prints Canon® Pixma® iP8720 Digital photography classes will want a high quality photo printer in-house, and the Canon Pixma iP8720 is a great entry-level option. Featuring a 6-color ink system, students will be able to print on a range of media sizes, including 13" x 19" borderless photos, and you'll have your own high end photo printing lab right in your classroom. For classes that print photos sporadically, you'll be better off buying a lower priced color inkjet machine (see the "budget friendly all-in-one" option above). The Canon PIXMA iP8720 printer uses 6 ink cartridges, which are sold in both a standard and high yield size. Canon sells the PGI-250XL high yield black ink cartridge for $24.99, at a yield of 500 pages. The CLI-251XL color cartridges are sold in five different colors, black, cyan, magenta and yellow, offering a yield of 660 pages per cartridge at $19.99. You will need two different black cartridges to operate the machine, the PGI-250 cartridge is pigment based for text printing, while the CL-251 option is dye-based ink and formulated for photo prints. LD brand compatible Canon PGI-250XL and CLI-251XL cartridges are just $6.49 each! Frequent Color Prints Brother® HL-L8350CDW If your classroom prints in color but doesn't print photos, color laser printers are the smarter buy. Inexpensive color inkjet printer are an enticing choice at first glance, but you'll probably end up spending more replacing one set of ink cartridges than the initial cost of the machine. Color laser printers cost more upfront, but cartridge replacement will be far less frequent due to a higher toner capacity. Brother's HL-8350CDW printer is a well-respected machine that offers easy to use wireless features and a handy secure function lock that can put a limit on your students' page usage. A front access USB slot lets you print directly from any flash drive and a 250-sheet paper capacity tray can adjust for both letter and legal size pages. The Brother HL-8350CDW printer requires four individual color toner cartridges: black, cyan, magenta and yellow. Although the standard TN-331 series is available, you'll get more overall value going with the TN-336 high yield option. Brother sells the black toner for $56.69, offering a yield of 4,000 pages and each color for $100.19 at 3,500 pages per cartridge. Like the previously mentioned Brother machine, this printer also includes a separate drum unit that will need to be replaced after the use of 3 or 4 toners. The Brother brand DR-331CL drum unit goes for $179.99. LD brand compatible toner cartridges are considerably cheaper, at $31.99 apiece. Heavy Duty Workhorse HP® Color LaserJet® Enterprise M553dn For teachers that print multiple pages every day, a reliable heavy-duty machine is worth considering. HP's Color Laserjet Enterprise M553dn is a nice choice, capable of printing high volume quality color pages at fast speeds. The printer uses four toner cartridges, sold as both a standard and high yield, with high yield black cartridge offering a yield of 12,500 pages and each color cartridge offering 9,500 pages apiece. An original HP 508X goes for $221.99 at Staples and each color goes for $306.99. If you go with LD brand compatible replacement cartridges, the savings are even greater. The high yield black LD compatible cartridge is just $88.99 and each color is only $93.99. LD also sells a 4 pack of compatible toners for $354.96. Finding the perfect printer for your classroom takes a bit of research, but once you have your needs mapped out and know what to look for, you can easily find the best printing solution for your class.

To get the exact look and feel you want, you'll want to invest in versatile color printer that is designed for DIY. Here, we break down a few of our favorite printers that are a perfect fit for all your wedding day essentials. Before we jump into the printers, let's review a couple of essential printer features that will really help your wedding stationery shine. First off, a color inkjet printer is a must. Not only are they more flexible than any laser printer, but they print well on a variety of paper types and sizes too. Need to print a fancy font type or include a couple of engagement photos in your invite? A color inkjet printer does a stellar job of handling both, thanks to a wide color range and reliable print consistency of the ink cartridges. DIY enthusiasts are likely looking to print other wedding essentials like envelopes or place cards too. To ensure your potential printer will meet your needs, check that the printer specs are compatible with the appropriate paper type. For best results, you'll want to pay close attention to the weight of your stationery (typically identified in lbs., points or GSM). The Paper Mill put together a wonderful blog article on paper compatibility that sums up the specifics of card stock quite nicely, and they even offer paper suggestions.

Save time and potential frustration with Brother's preset printing profile, a built-in printer feature that conveniently saves frequently used printing configurations.

You can find out by calculating the cartridge cost per page. Cost per page, or the cost of printing a single page with print cartridge, is an easy way to manage your printing expenses. The higher the cost per page, the bigger the monthly printing bill. Two main factors determine cost per page, page yield and printer cartridge cost: Page Yield Page yield is the approximate number of pages you can print with a cartridge. All printer brands base their yields on a 5% page coverage, where only 5% of the page is imprinted with ink. This standard is equivalent to printing a short paragraph or email, allowing customers to easily compare cost efficiency across products. Yield varies greatly from cartridge to cartridge and some cartridges will print significantly more pages than others. To get the best value, look for a printer that offers a high yield cartridge at a low cost. You can usually find page yield information on the printer cartridge box, in your printer manual or on the printer manufacturer's website. LD Products also lists the page yield in the "specs" table of their cartridge pages on the website. Let's look at the HP 64XL black ink cartridge as a quick example. This cartridge has a yield of 600 pages, which means it can print approximately 600 short emails or paragraphs (based off the 5% page coverage). Since everyone's printing habits are different, the actual number of prints you get from a cartridge changes from user to user. If you print something a bit more substantial like a legal document or business proposal, you will not be able to print as many pages. Printer Cartridge Cost Cartridge cost can vary just as much as page yield. Some ink cartridges can run for less than ten dollars and some toner cartridges can be priced in the hundreds of dollars. Two printer cartridges can even offer the same exact page yield but differ greatly in price. Each manufacturer has their own reasons for charging a particular price, including technology and development costs that help determine the value. For example, an original HP 64XL black ink cartridge and a Brother LC103 black ink cartridge both print 600 pages. The HP cartridge sells for $37.99 and the Brother cartridge sells for $16.79. As such, the Brother cartridge offers a much better overall value. Even slight variations in page yield and cartridge cost can mean a drastically different printing bill at the end of the day depending on what printer you own. Calculating Cost per Page Now that you are familiar with page yield and printer cartridge cost, you can use that information to calculate the cost per page. All you need to do is divide the cartridge page yield by the cost of the printer cartridge… Printer cartridge price / Page yield = Cost per Page We'll start by calculating cost per page for our HP 64XL black ink cartridge example: $37.99 / 600=6.3 cents If we use the same formula for the Brother cartridge, we get: $16.79 / 600 = 2.7 cents Further confirming that the Brother cartridge is a better deal! Calculating the cost per page for color cartridges is slightly different. Since all of the cartridges work together to produce the colors in your prints, the quoted page yield takes all of the involved cartridges into consideration. To get the cost for your color cartridges, first calculate the cost per page for each individual cartridge using the same formula. Then, add up the cost per page of all of the cartridges. Keep in mind, most cyan, magenta and yellow cartridges have the same page yield and the black cartridge usually has a slightly higher page yield. If your printer uses four individual ink cartridges, you would add up the cost per page of all four cartridges: (Black cartridge price / page yield) + ((Color cartridge price / page yield) x 3) = Color cartridge cost per page We'll use the original HP 204A toner cartridges for our example. The black 204A toner cartridge sells for $50.99 and prints 1,100 pages. Original cyan, magenta and yellow toner cartridges go for $56.99 and print 900 pages each. ($50.99 / 1,100) + (($56.99 / 900) x 3) = 23.5 cents per page Reduce Your Cost per Page Even More with Compatible Cartridges! You can bring your costs down further when you switch to LD brand compatible cartridges. Compatible cartridges offer the same print quality and page yield as a name brand cartridge for a fraction of the cost. To demonstrate, let's compare the compatible cost per page of all three cartridge series we mentioned previously: LD Brand Compatible HP 64XL Black Ink Cartridge $18.99 / 600 pages = 3.1 cents per page LD Brand Compatible Brother LC103 Black Ink Cartridge $5.99 / 600 pages = .99 cents per page LD Brand Compatible HP 204A Black Toner Cartridge $29.99 / 1,100 pages = 2.7 cents per page LD Brand Compatible HP 204A Color Toner Cartridges ($29.99 / 1,100 pages) + (($34.99 / 900) x 3) = 14.1 cents per page *Savings based on price comparison between remanufactured/compatible cartridge prices on www.LDProducts.com and OEM cartridge and printer prices from Staples.

In this quick guide, we review the 9 most common printer types on the market, so you can buy the right printer model for your needs. Inkjet Printers Single-function Inkjet Printers If all you need to do is print, single-function printers a solid choice. The printers are easy to use and can handle the most basic of printing duties, including black and color prints. Be sure to keep cartridge costs in mind when weighing printer model options as cartridge price can vary, depending on the printer you choose. Consumers that need scan or fax issues should skip the single-function models and skip ahead to multi-function printers. Key Features Uses ink cartridges Prints in black and color (text, color images and photos are all taken care of!) Perfect for casual home printer users that aren't looking for extra features Recommended Printer Models HP ® OfficeJet Pro 8210 Canon ® PIXMA iX6820 Epson ® Workforce WF-100 Multifunction or All-in-one Printers Multi-function or all-in-one printers are the most common printers available today. Offering print, scan and copy functionality, they make a great option for busy families, a home office or small businesses. There are dozens of multifunction printers on the market, each with slightly different features, cartridge pricing and page yield. To ensure you have the right one for your needs, pay special attention to the specs of each model you are considering. The price of a multifunction printer ranges across printer models and manufacturers. Some, like the HP ® Deskjet 1112, are priced cheaply, but with original cartridge prices ranging up to $33.99, you are essentially buying a new printer every time you replace a cartridge. To avoid getting stuck with expensive ink, set cost expectations before you buy. Multifunction printers with inexpensive ink are out there, but you will likely have to pay a little bit more up front for the printer. The Brother MFC-J985DW, for example, is more expensive but uses LC20E cartridges that print more than 1,200 pages at a cost of less than $20 apiece. Compatible LD cartridges bring costs down even more, at just $8.49 for the black cartridge and $7.49 for each color. Key Features Uses ink cartridges Prints in black and color (text, color images and photos are all taken care of!)

Photo printers cost more and require more cartridges too, but the quality of your photos is worth the added expense. Cartridges are either pigment based, dye based, or a combination of both, depending on your printer. Printers are designed to work with a variety of photo papers and print sizes, with many offering wide format printing. Photo printers are costly, but for good reason. Printers can use anywhere between 6 and 12 ink cartridges to produce a print. To keep costs low, consider LD brand compatible cartridges. Key Features Uses ink cartridges (pigment-based, dye-based, or both) Prints in black and color (text, color images and photos are all taken care of!) Commonly used by professional photographers Recommended Printer Models Epson Artisan 1430 (uses dye-based inks) Canon PIXMA Pro-100 (uses dye-based inks) Canon PIXMA Pro-10 (uses pigment based inks) Ink Tank Printers Ink tank printers are designed for heavy-duty printing needs. Instead of buying new cartridges, you buy ink bottles which supply ink to the printer. Using super high capacity ink tanks to produce a print, the printers are capable of printing thousands of page for an incredibly low cost. The one caveat is the printer's high price tag, so keep that in mind when factoring in the total cost of operation. While the printers are more expensive, the printer's ink bottles are it's biggest selling point. For example, Epson's T664 black cartridge prints 4,000 pages for just $14.29 and it's color ink bottles print 6,500 pages for the same price. That's a lot of prints for the price, but if you don't print often, the cost savings may not be worth it. Key Features Uses ink bottles and super high capacity ink tanks Prints in black and color (text, color images and photos are all taken care of!) Great for heavy duty printer users Recommended Printer Models Epson Ecotank ET-2600 Canon Pixma G3200 Epson Workforce ET-3600 Laser Printers Monochrome Laser Printers Businesses prefer monochrome laser printers thanks to their quick print speed and heavy duty print capabilities. These printers only print in black, making them a great option for text heavy offices. With only one toner cartridge to replace, it's easy to keep your printing costs low. Look for a printer that uses high yield or extra high yield toner cartridges for the best overall value. They may cost a little bit more, but the savings pay off in the long term. To save even more, shop LD compatible toner cartridges. Key Features Uses a black toner cartridge Prints in black Perfect for business users that print a lot of documents and don't need color. Recommended Printer Models BrotherHL-L2300D Canon ImageClass LBP151dw Brother HL-L6200DW Color Laser Printers Color laser printers are perfect for small to medium businesses looking to add a little color to their next quarterly report. Offering more flexibility and a significant cost savings compared to the typical color inkjet printer, these machines use four separate toner cartridges. Replacements can get expensive, but individual cartridge colors can be replaced as needed. Their high page yield more than makes up for the high price tag, with most offering thousands of prints per cartridge. These printers usually start around $150 and can go up considerably from there depending on how many extra features you need.

Most every printer these days is capable of printing out quality text or photos, so why the difference in price? Here, we break down four reasons why some printer cartridges cost more than others and offer some simple savings tips so you can make a smart buy the next time you are shopping for ink. Your printer has inefficient operating costs Printers seem to fluctuate in price just as much cartridges do. Different printers go on sale every week and with dozens of models to choose from, tracking down the best deal isn't easy. Case in point, HP featured 30 printers on sale this week for their Cyber Sale! If you don't have a specific model in mind, it's understandable why many first time printer buyers are drawn to the least expensive printer in the bunch. Printers aren't the most exciting gadget in your office and most of us don't want commit to too large of an investment. Many printer manufacturers have thrived off selling inexpensive printers to uninformed customers, better known as the razor and blade business model. By setting a low price on razor handles and by increasing the cost of short-lived blades, razor blade companies have been enjoying healthy profits for decades. Printer manufacturers seem to have taken a cue from the success of razor blade companies, selling certain printer models for cheap, only to later charge a high price for printer cartridges. The next time you are drawn to a printer sale, take the time to research the printer and it's cartridges. You are using the wrong printer cartridges for your printing needs Printer cartridge type and cartridge page yield play a major role in the cost effectiveness of your printer. Whether you own an all-in-one inkjet or a color laser printer, what you print and what type of cartridge you are printing with determines how quickly you go through your ink. Inkjet printers use ink to produce a print and are best suited for low volume, home printing needs. Thanks to their smaller size, most inkjet printers hold a limited amount of ink, which unfortunately leaves more opportunities for replacement. Laser printers on the other hand, use toner cartridges and are the preferred choice for businesses with heavy-duty printing needs. Toner cartridges are more expensive than ink, but the trade-off is in their page yield. Most toner cartridges can print uninterrupted for thousands of pages and unlike an ink cartridge, toner cartridges won't dry up if you go weeks between print jobs. Check out our blog article for a more detailed explanation of inkjet verses laser printers here. Your cartridge page yield is inefficient Page yield is the quoted number of printed pages you can expect from one cartridge, as provided by your printer manufacturer. The yield is an approximation based on 5% page coverage, or prints in which 5% of the page is covered with ink. Cartridges have a different yield across printer models, with black cartridges typically printing more pages than color cartridges. Cartridges are often sold in a standard yield and high yield (XL) size. Extra high yield cartridges available for select cartridge series too but are far less common. Higher yield cartridges contain more ink, offering more prints per cartridge and are generally the best option if you print frequently. Cartridge cost can differ depending on the printer model. In fact, two cartridges with comparable page yields can be sold at completely different price points, which can significantly impact your bottom line if you choose the printer with the higher priced cartridges. Let's look at the Epson 312XL black ink cartridge and Epson 202XL black ink cartridge as an example. The Epson® 312XL high yield black cartridge prints 500 pages and sells for $18.99* and the 202XL prints 550 pages, and sells for $34.99. If you bought the printer that uses the 202XL series, you are paying sixteen more dollars for just 50 additional pages. To get the most value, don't just focus on the printer price, compare the cartridge page yields across printer models too! Frequent cartridge replacement is impacting your printer budget Continually replacing high-priced printer cartridges can be frustrating. If you are looking to cut down printing costs, compatible cartridges from a reputable third-party manufacturer like LD Products are the perfect low cost alternative, offering comparable print results and page yield at a great value. Since the resources needed to create a compatible alternative cost very little, the savings can be passed along directly to the customer, without sacrificing print quality. For example, an original Brother LC3019C extra high yield cyan ink cartridge prints 1,400 pages and sells for $28.99. The LD brand compatible version is just $4.99, at a 82% savings. Find thousands of compatible ink and toner cartridges for most every printer model on LD Products.com, available for a fraction of the price of the original brand. *Savings based on price comparison between remanufactured/compatible cartridge prices on www.LDProducts.com and OEM cartridge and printer prices from the listed retailers: Staples.

Print, scan and fax functions offer streamlined functionality and an automatic duplexer makes 2-sided printing quick and convenient. Customers appreciate it's small size and simplified print display, but with a page capacity of just 100 sheets, restocking paper can quickly get repetitive if you print frequently.

The printer uses five individual ink cartridges, including a pigment black cartridge (PGI-280) for printing text and a photo black cartridge (CLI-281) for high quality photo prints. To get the most value, choose the extra high yield cartridges, as they provide more prints at a lower cost per page.

Choose the Right Printer Settings When you are printing photos, don't forget to change the print settings on your printer. All inkjet printers have a "photo printing" setting which you can find under the printer properties menu. To pull it up on your laptop, you can either navigate to File > Print with your mouse or type CTRL + P on your keyboard, then select "Printer Properties". Choose the Right Printing Paper, Paper Size and Paper Source With the printer properties menu pulled up, you will also want to take a moment to select the right paper, paper size, print quality and paper source. Paper Types Depending on what type of photo you are after, there are a number of photo paper options to choose from. We've included the most common types below. Glossy paper features a highly reflective coating. Common types of glossy finishes include high gloss, soft gloss, and satin finishes which create deep vibrant colors and high contrast sharpness. They are good for albums and displaying away from windows, where the natural light will reflect off the front of your image and distort it. Glossy finishes are commonly used in formal portraiture. Glossy coatings are susceptible to dust and show fingerprints, so they should be handled wisely. Semi-gloss paper incorporates some gloss, but not as much as high gloss finishes. Common types include satin, pearl, and lustre-the later of which is very popular among photographers for its versatility and good D-max capabilities. Semi-gloss finishes print good, clean colors and strong contrast, and they frame well behind glass. Matte paper is made from hot-pressed fibre and does not have a glossy coat. Because it lacks a smooth and shiny coating, it can come in a variety of different textures from a soft velvet to visibly-woven high cotton paper to thick, dimpled paper that makes your print resemble a watercolor painting. Matte paper is the best for getting rich and deep dark tones, making it ideal for black and white photographers. For color photographers, matte paper can make colors look "older" than a glossy or semi-gloss paper will. Much like glossy finishes, gallery-quality prints on matte paper may require special handling like cotton gloves to prevent fingerprinting. Paper Size and Paper Source Photos come in all kinds of sizes: 4 x 6, 5 x 7, and 8 x 10 are a few of the most common! Most inkjet printers come with a built-in photo tray to handle smaller prints like 4 x 6. Consult your printer user guide to determine if this is an option for you. For example, the Canon TR8260 printer we reference in this guide has an additional rear paper tray that can be used for photo prints. Pro tip: Before you decide what size to print your photo, play close attention to the pixels! The more pixels a photo has, the larger the print can be. Whenever you print a photo from your phone or laptop and it looks grainy or pixelated, it's because it doesn't have enough PPI (pixels per inch). For best results, you need to determine the optimal print size for your photo and print the photo within that range. To do this, you first need to find the dimensions of your photo. On a PC, right click on the photo and select "Properties", then go to the "Details" tab to pull up the dimensions. If the picture opens up in the Windows Photos program, right click the photo and select "File Information" to bring up the dimensions. Then refer to the chart below to determine the optimal print size for your photo. In our example with dimensions of 3088 x 2056, we can print the photo as large as 11 x 14 and not lose any sharpness. Take Care of Your Printer For top photo quality, you need to maintain your printer. An idle printer is an expensive printer because ink will dry out over time if the printer is not used enough!! That means printing regularly (at least once a week) and running the cleaning function every once in a while, which keeps the printheads primed. Doing this prevents clogs so your cartridges last longer. We show you how to run the cleaning function in an Epson printer below, but the process is similar for most every printer model, it can usually be found in the maintenance section of your printer display screen!
