                    content is provided to the end user. The EU statutory right

                    have provided the appropriate consent and acknowledgement)
                    the moment you start downloading the content and services

                    to Products that are faulty, not as described or not

                    are not affected by your right of withdrawal referred to in
                    Condition 12 and Schedule 1 or anything else in these
                    Terms. Advice about your legal rights is available from

<strong> Other important terms </strong>

</li><li>
                    We may transfer our rights and obligations under these
                    Terms to another organisation, but this will not affect
                    your rights or our obligations under these Terms.
                
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
                    You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under
                    these Terms to another person if we agree in writing.
                
</li><li>
                    These Terms are between you and us. No other person shall
                    have any rights to enforce any of their terms, whether
                    under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or
                    otherwise. However, we and you will not need the consent of
                    a recipient of your gift of a Product to cancel or make any
                    changes to these Terms.
                
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
                    Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately.
                    If any provision or part-provision of these Terms is or
                    becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be
                    deemed deleted, but that shall not affect the validity and
                    enforceability of the rest of this agreement. If any court
                    or relevant authority decides that any of the conditions
                    are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions
                    will remain in full force and effect.
                
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
                    If we fail to insist that you perform any of your
                    obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our
                    rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will
                    not mean that we have waived our rights against you and
                    will not mean that you do not have to comply with those
                    obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only
                    do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will
                    automatically waive any later default by you.
                
</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>
                    Please note that these Terms are governed by English law.
                    This means any dispute or claim arising out of or in
                    connection with them will be governed by English law. You
                    and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will
                    have non-exclusive jurisdiction. However, if you are a
                    resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings
                    in Northern Ireland, and if you are a resident of Scotland,
                    you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.
