Your Choices for Advertising Cookies</h3><p>  The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” or "share" personal information, as the terms “sell” and "share" are defined under the CCPA, to provide California residents the right to opt-out from such sales or sharing. Sale and/or sharing are in such a way that may include allowing advertising vendors to receive certain information (such as cookie identifiers, IP addresses, and/or browsing behavior) to add to a profile (about your device, browser, or you). Such profiles may enable delivery of interest-based advertising by such advertising vendors within their platform or on other sites. When you visit our website, we may share the following categories of information for such interest-based advertising, which may be considered a “sale” or "sharing" as defined by the CCPA: (1) device information and identifiers, such as IP address and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; and (2) connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage. We engage in such practices to provide you with more tailored marketing content (about our services or other services), and to evaluate whether this content is useful or effective. You may opt-out of such advertising cookies on a go-forward basis within our cookie banner or by contacting us through our <a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/en/contact/?l=en&form=datarequest" target="_blank"> Help Center </a>. For more information on clearing previously-placed advertising cookies, please see our Help Center article <a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-do-I-enable-cookies-on-my-computer" target="_blank"> here </a>. </p></div> <p><p>  We do not “sell” or “share” sensitive personal information, as those terms are defined by the CCPA. </p></p> <p><p>  Please note that we also respond to and abide by opt-out preference signals sent through the Global Privacy Control. Any opt-out preferences you have exercised through this method will only to the specific device/browser on which you made them. </p></p> <p><p>  Please note that Do Not Track is a different privacy mechanism than the “Global Privacy Control” browser choice referenced above, which is a browser-based control that indicates whether you would like to opt out of processing of your personal information for online behavioral advertising purposes. </p></p> <p><p>  Our services are not directed to consumers under 16 - and such minors are not authorized to use our services - so we do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. </p></p> <div><h4>  7.
