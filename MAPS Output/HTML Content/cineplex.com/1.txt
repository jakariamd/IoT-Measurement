It may also include other types of more technical information such as IP addresses, geolocation, device ID, or browsing history in connection with our Applications or Websites, but only when this information can identify you as an individual.

For instance, we may collect the following type of information:</p><ul>  <li><strong> Video Surveillance.  </strong>As a security measure and to ensure the safety of our properties, we use video surveillance technology at our physical locations. This collection is subject to applicable privacy laws and may be shared only in limited circumstances, as detailed in the Sharing of Personal Information section of this Privacy Policy.</li><li><strong> On Premises Devices and Imaging Technology.  </strong>We may use on premises cameras, image sensors, and imaging technologies (e.g. anonymous video analytics and anonymous traffic analysis) at our physical locations or advertising installations for the following purposes:
</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>measuring viewer engagement and interest with visual media in order to improve digital displays and signage;;</li><li>measuring viewer demographics present in our physical locations, including age and gender of viewers, in order to justify ad-space value and manage ad-content scheduling;</li><li>forecasting trends and traffic patterns in order to improve resource allocation and management; and</li><li>enhancing health and safety measures.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  The above-described devices and imaging technologies are strictly used for the purposes of aggregated analysis (i.e. non-identifying purposes) and do not store images of individuals.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Technical Information. </strong> The nature of internet browsing is such that this activity passively and automatically collects and discloses certain information about an individual’s use of the internet. This information may be associated with an individual’s Internet Protocol ("IP") address. This is a unique internet "address" which is assigned to all internet users by their Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). Our server logs record statistical information, such as visitors' IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, webpages requested, as well as identifying categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. We may also track devices which have communicated with our Wi-Fi systems at our physical locations, but such tracking is conducted without the storage of information that is personally identifying.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Cookies.  </strong>Our Applications and Websites make use of both "sessional" and "persistent" cookies or similar technologies. Cookies are small text files offered to your computer by Web servers to keep track of your browser settings as you navigate the site. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive. Sessional cookies are stored in temporary (cache) memory and are deleted when you shut down your browser or turn off your computer. We use these cookies or similar technologies to store your preferences, record session information such as language preferences, record user-specific information on what pages you access or visit, develop information about your preferences and interests, alert you to areas that we think might be of interest to you when you return to our site, record past activity in order to provide better service when you return to our site, help rotate banner advertising so as to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and customize content based on your browser type or other information you provide. For each visit to our Websites, cookies or similar technologies may be used by our server to recognize you where you have indicated your preference to be automatically logged in. You may disable cookies using your browser's settings. Please consult your browser's help function for information on how to disable cookies. Note that if you disable cookies, certain features of our Websites will not function to their fullest potential.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Interest-Based Advertising.  </strong>Our Applications and Websites also use cookies and similar tools for tailored interest-based advertising purposes. These cookies and tools may be placed by us, or by our advertising partners. When you make use of our Applications or Websites, we collect information about the device you are using, including (as applicable) your Internet, telecom or mobile carrier and service provider, IP address, device ID, the date and time of your visit, the pages of the website you visit, the features of the Website or Application that you use, and the referring URLs you came from. Our Applications and Websites also make use of use pixels, or transparent GIF files (sometimes called “beacons”), to help manage online interest-based advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partners. These files enable us to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.If you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these technologies may still collect data for other purposes, including analytics, and you may still see ads across the Internet, but the ads will not be targeted based on information about you, and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.Interest-based advertising opt-outs work by saving cookies in your browser that tell the various ad partners that you have opted-out. Because cookies are generally browser-specific, your choice will only apply to the web browser from which you opt-out. You must opt-out from each web browser from which you do not want interest-based advertising (and this may involve different devices, if you use more than one).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Location Information. </strong>Through your mobile device, you may have the ability to activate the location tracking functionality to allow Cineplex to access your GPS location.
