We have the responsibility as data controller for this information.</p><p>  We refer to our <a href="https://www.one.com/en/about/privacy-notice" target="_blank"> Privacy Notice </a> for info on our collection and use of your personal data.</p></div> <div><h3>  one.com acting as data processor</h3><p>  If you store personal information on our servers one.com will act as data processor for this information. As our customer, you are the data controller for this data and will need a Data Processor Agreement (DPA) with us.</p><p>  Here you can find our <a href="/static/info/data-processing-agreement-en.pdf" target="_blank"> 
			Data Processing Agreement
		 </a> which will apply to all our customers in the European Union that are using us to process personal data.</p></div> <p><p>  Together with our updated privacy policies, this will be the foundation you need when processing personal data on our systems.</p></p> <p><p>  Note that if you only use our services for processing of personal data for purely personal or household activities and you are a natural individual then the EU Privacy Regulation does not apply to you and you do not need a DPA.</p></p> <div><h3>  We encourage you to keep your personal details updated</h3><p>  The customer can help one.com to improve the effectiveness and quality of service by keeping one.com notified of any changes to the customer’s name, address, phone number or email address. The customer can do this by updating the customer’s personal details when logged into the customer’s one.com control panel.</p></div> <div><h2>  Customer data policy</h2></div> <div><h3>  Customer Data</h3><p>  By Customer data is meant any information the customer has placed on his/her web space at one.com, for example emails, internet pages, photos and database content.</p><p>  To the extent that the customer is processing personal data as a data controller, we refer to the above <a href="#DATAPROCESSER" target="_blank"> one.com acting as data processor </a> paragraph.</p></div> <div><h3>  The Customer’s Data on the Account</h3><p>  Registration of a domain through one.com makes the customer the owner of the domain. The customer maintains all rights to the content that the customer places on his/her one.com web space. The templates and images placed at disposal by one.com, remains property of one.com. However, one.com does not claim any rights to the content that the customer has placed on the account. The account holder is on the other hand legally responsible for the content placed on the account.</p></div> <p><p>  one.com does not form any opinion or perform any legal review of the content on a customer’s web space account. However, in case of obvious illegal content for example child pornography, phishing attempts or the like, one.com will act as a responsible company and inform the relevant authorities. In all other cases one.com will take action if an EU or US court or another relevant authority orders one.com to do so.</p></p> <div><h3>  The Customer’s Responsibility for the Account at one.com</h3><p>  The customer should always log out of any account when finishing a session, to ensure that others cannot access the customer’s private personal information. The customer should take this precaution even if the customer is not using a public computer at a library, an internet café or the like.</p></div> <div><h3>  Data Security</h3><p>  one.com recognizes the special responsibility that comes with the hosting of personal data on customer’s web space accounts. We want our customers to consider one.com a trusted place for data storage. The one.com data center is therefore designed to meet the highest standards of security. All customer data and one.com’s system data are secured through a daily remote backup of all servers via a private 10 Gbit fibre connection to a separate backup data center located 10 km from the main data center.</p></div> <p><p>  The daily backup secures our customers’ web spaces against data loss. The backup includes all web spaces, regardless of type or size. Backup is a precaution against data loss caused by errors within one.com’s control. Consequently, unless the reason for the data loss is outside one.com’s control, we are able to recover all content after a potential failure. When restoring from a backup, the whole server and all web spaces on the server will be restored to their state prior to the failure.</p></p> <div><h2>  Domain Expiration Policy</h2></div> <div><h3>  Generic Top Level domains and .uk / .co.uk / .me.uk / .org.uk domain names</h3><p>  one.com renews the registration of a domain name prior to its expiration, provided that the registrant of the domain complies with one.com’s terms of payment.</p></div> <div><h3>  Domain expiration notification</h3><p>  Prior to the expiration of a gTLD, one.com notifies the registrant of the domain twice with instructions for renewing the domain name.
