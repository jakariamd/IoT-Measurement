Important update to ToS! Attention!</h4><p>  
					We make every effort to maintain our payouts for Tier groups: we communicate with managers of ad agencies, negotiate the best terms, change networks constantly, and develop anti-AdBlock scripts, among many other actions.

					In this regard, we STRONGLY REQUEST that you do the following immediately:
					1. Open your file manager.
					2. Check the adult video using the checkbox.
					3. Assign the selected adult video to the category "Adult" (pay attention - "category"), using the "Set category for selected" button.
					4. From now on, if you work with adult content, you must always check the "Adult" category for adult content.
</p></div> <p><p>  
					Separating the content into "adult" and "not adult" enables us to continue building relationships with various ad agencies and to develop our service.
</p></p> <p><p>  
					Thank you for your understanding,
					Your affiliate managers team.
