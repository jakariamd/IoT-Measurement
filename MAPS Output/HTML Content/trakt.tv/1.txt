We use technical infrastructure in the United States and other jurisdictions to provide our Services to Trakt users wherever they are located. As such, we must sometimes transfer data across jurisdictional boundaries. If you use our Services, it is possible that your Personal Information may be transferred outside of your jurisdiction to the United States or other locations where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. The United States, EEA Member States, and other countries all have different laws. When your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your Personal Information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live. For example, if your information is in the US, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with US law. </p></div> <p><p>  Trakt is committed to using lawful data transfer mechanisms for all cross-border transfers of Personal Information. For Personal Information of Data Subjects transferred from the EEA to outside the EEA, Trakt relies on the most current Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission or another appropriate legal basis for such data transfers, where required. To the extent that Trakt is deemed to transfer Personal Information outside of the EEA, we do so on the legal basis that such transfer is necessary to provide you with the Services you have chosen to use. </p></p> <p><p>  By allowing us to collect Personal Information about you, you consent to the transfer and processing of your Personal Information as described in this section. We do not warrant that our Services are appropriate or authorized for use in any other jurisdictions.
