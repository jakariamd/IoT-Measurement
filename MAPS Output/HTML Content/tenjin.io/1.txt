<div><h1>  Privacy Policy</h1></div> <div><h5>  LAST UPDATED: October 28, 2022</h5><p>  Tenjin, Inc. is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. The first section of this document describes our practices in connection with information that we collect from our customers and potential customers through the websites operated by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the "Websites"), and from users of the Websites (whether or not such users are our customers). The Websites include tenjin.io, tenjin.com, blog.tenjin.io, blog.tenjin.com, docs.tenjin.io, docs.tenjin.com, track.tenjin.io, and track.tenjin.com. The second section describes the information we collect in the course of providing services to our customers (the "Services"). If you are a Tenjin employee or contractor and want to learn how Tenjin uses your personal information, you can find that information in the "Tenjin Notice of Data Privacy for  Employees" posted in Confluence.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act (the "UKDPA") </strong></p><p>  Tenjin provides tools and services to mobile app developers so that they can track and analyze certain End User actions in the context of mobile marketing. Tenjin does not collect any data directly (except from the companies and people that sign up for Tenjin or request marketing info, which is described in the Website Privacy Policy below). With regard to Tenjin’s Services, under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") and the UK’s Data Protection Act (the "UKDPA"), Tenjin is a data processor. As a data processor, Tenjin processes, and may store, information sent by Tenjin customers from their mobile apps. Tenjin’s customers may send information about the End Users of their apps, and the users' devices, to Tenjin for processing and storage. The mobile app developers must receive your consent in order for Tenjin to process, and perhaps store, your data. Tenjin recognizes your right of access under Section 15 of GDPR and Section 45 of UKDPA.  If you are a user of a Tenjin customer’s mobile app, and you wish to exercise your right of access, you must contact the owner or operator of the mobile app (the data collector).</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) </strong></p><p>  The California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") became law on January 1st, 2020 but enforcement begins six (6) months from the date the California Attorney General issues final regulations (which shall be no later than July 1st, 2020).  With regard to Tenjin’s Services, under CCPA, Tenjin is a service provider. As a service provider, Tenjin processes, and may store, information sent by Tenjin customers from their mobile apps. Tenjin’s customers may send information about the End Users of their apps, and the users' devices, to Tenjin for processing and storage. Tenjin customers must comply with the opt-out requirements under CCPA (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.120(a)) and take into account any exceptions or other requirements mandated by law.  As a service provider, Tenjin relies on CCPA’s business purpose exemption under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.140(t)(2)(C) and as a service provider, Tenjin does not have any direct obligations to the End Users to obtain consent, provide opt-outs, or delete data.  If you are a user of a Tenjin customer’s mobile app and you wish to opt-out or exercise another right under CCPA, you must contact the app publisher (the business).</p></div> <p><p>  The above applies to both Section 1 and Section 2 below.</p></p> <div><h3>  SECTION 1: WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</h3></div> <div><h4>  Personal Information</h4><p>  "Personal Information" is information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable person.
