GENERAL INFORMATION </strong></p></p> <p><p>  1.1 OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</p></p> <p><p>  Your privacy is important to us and maintaining your trust is one of our highest priorities. This Privacy Policy provides you with a description of how we collect and use data relating to or identifying individuals (“<strong> Personal Data </strong>”). We also provide information on privacy rights, how to exercise these rights and how to contact us with any questions. </p></p> <p><p>  1.2 INTRODUCTION TO BRAZE</p></p> <p><p>  Braze is a U.S. company, headquartered in New York, with global operations. A reference to “<strong> Braze </strong>,” “<strong> we </strong>,” “<strong> us </strong>” or the “<strong> Company </strong>” is a reference to Braze, Inc. and the relevant affiliate(s) involved in the processing activity.</p></p> <p><p>  Braze is a life-cycle engagement platform for companies around the world, supporting stronger relationships between brands and their clients, primarily by leveraging first party data to personalize and automate life-cycle marketing campaigns through first party channels, such as email, SMS, mobile and web push notifications, and in-app/in-browser messaging.</p></p> <p><p>  More information about Braze can be found at <a href="https://www.braze.com/" target="_blank"> www.braze.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Our Japanese website can be found at <a href="https://www.braze.co.jp/" target="_blank"> https://www.braze.co.jp/ </a>. </p></p> <p><p>  1.3 SCOPE OF THIS POLICY </p></p> <div><p>  <em> What is in Scope? </em></p><p>  This Privacy Policy applies to Braze, where we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data for our marketing or business purposes (further details below) and in such capacity, we will use the term “Data Controller”. </p><p>  <em> What is not in Scope? </em></p><p>  Our Websites and Services are intended to be used by businesses and their representatives. We do not offer any products or services to individuals for personal, family or household use. All Personal Data that we process is treated as belonging to individuals in a business capacity.</p></div> <p><p>  Braze’s privacy commitments to its customers, where we process Personal Data on behalf of our customers, are outlined in Braze’s agreements with such customers. In our capacity as a processor of our customers’ data, we will refer to ourselves as a “Data Processor.” Specifically, in that capacity, Braze processes Personal Data of people who interact with customer applications or websites that are offered by our customers and that have incorporated Braze technology (“<strong> Customer Applications </strong>”). The protections that apply to such Personal Data will be described in the individual privacy policies of those customers, and not in this Privacy Policy. If you wish to learn more about the privacy and data security practices of those customers, you should reach out to them directly. For clarity, this Privacy Policy does not cover any Personal Data that our customers choose to collect and share with Braze, where Braze is not the Data Controller, but is instead a Data Processor.</p></p> <p><p>  Individuals who are interested in, apply for, or are recruited for a job with Braze can find our related privacy practices described in our <a href="https://www.braze.com/company/legal/privacy-policy-job-candidates" target="_blank"> Candidate Privacy Policy </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Additionally, our Websites or Services (as defined below) may contain links to other websites, applications and services maintained by third parties. The privacy and data security practices of such third-party sites and/or services are governed by the privacy statements of those third parties, and not by this Privacy Policy. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> PART II.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS, SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION </strong></p></p> <p><p>  3.1 PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE</p></p> <p><p>  Braze, Inc. is located in the United States and our group companies operate in Singapore, Germany, Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Indonesia, and the United Kingdom. Braze works with vendors and partners who operate predominantly in these countries. From time to time, we may work with vendors and partners in other parts of the world where we do business. This means that when we collect your Personal Data, we may process it in any of these countries. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective), but we have in place appropriate safeguards and international transfer mechanisms (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses). We also provide a number of supplementary measures designed to better protect the Personal Data that we are entrusted with. </p></p> <p><p>  Notwithstanding the fact that it has been held to no longer provide a valid mechanism for transfers of Personal Data from the EU to the U.S., Braze continues to comply with and self-certify to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom and Switzerland to the United States. Braze has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank"> https://www.privacyshield.gov/ </a>. Braze is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In connection with onward transfers, Braze has responsibility for the processing of Personal Data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to any third party who is acting as an agent on Braze’s behalf. Braze will remain responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles if any such agent processes such Personal Data in a manner that is inconsistent with those Principles, unless Braze can provide evidence that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Braze commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your Personal Data. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Braze at:</p></p> <div><p>  or </p><p>  Braze, Inc.Privacy Policy IssuesAttention: General Counsel330 West 34th Street, 18th FloorNew York, NY 10001USA</p><p>  Braze has further committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints regarding Personal Data transferred from the EU, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Under certain circumstances, individuals may be able to invoke binding arbitration, in accordance with the Privacy Shield requirements. In addition, as a U.S.-based company, Braze may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p></div> <p><p>  3.2 SECURITY</p></p> <p><p>  We use a number of technical, organizational and administrative security measures designed to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of information. However, security risk is inherent in internet and information technologies and we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data. </p></p> <p><p>  3.3 DATA RETENTION</p></p> <p><p>  We will retain Personal Data we collect from you for so long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (in connection with the purposes set out in Part II above). We determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data on the basis of the purpose for which we process the Personal Data, the amount, nature and sensitivity of your Personal Data processed, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data and whether we can achieve the purposes of the processing through other means, as well as on the basis of applicable legal requirements (such as applicable statutes of limitation). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Data, we will either delete or anonymize it. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> PART IV. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS </strong></p></p> <p><p>  4.1 EXERCISING YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS </p></p> <p><p>  You may have the right under applicable law to request that we take certain actions in connection with Personal Data that we may have about you. Not all jurisdictions grant privacy rights, so whether or not you have any such rights, and the nature of those rights, are determined by multiple factors, including your location, country, state, or place of residence. Privacy rights may include the following: </p></p> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Information: </strong> You may be able to request information about the categories of Personal Data we collect, the categories of sources from which we collect it, the purposes for which we process it, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it. </li><li><strong> Access: </strong> You may be able to request access to the Personal Data we hold about you.</li><li><strong> Rectification/correction </strong>: You may be able to request modification or correction of your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Erasure/deletion: </strong> You may be able to request that we delete Personal Data we hold about you.</li><li><strong> Restriction: </strong> You may be able to request that we restrict use of your Personal Data. </li><li><strong> Objection: </strong> You may be able to object to the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing or where our legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interest.</li><li><strong> Portability: </strong> You may be able to request a copy of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, to allow you to transfer your data to another provider.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Automated Decision Making:  </strong>You may be able to request not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, where it produces a legal or similar effect.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If you wish to exercise any of these requests, please fill out this <a href="https://www.braze.com/company/legal/data-subject-request" target="_blank"> form </a>. We will respond to requests from individuals wishing to exercise data protection rights applicable to them. For certain rights, such as where you request access to Personal Data, we will need to confirm your identity. To verify your identity, we will require you to provide ID, where permitted or required by applicable law. You also have the right to exercise your applicable privacy rights free from discriminatory treatment and retaliation as prohibited by applicable law. These rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline or partially decline your request as permitted by law. </p></p> <p><p>  You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local supervisory authority. If you have a question about your privacy rights, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@braze.com" target="_blank"> privacy@braze.com </a>. </p></p> <p><p>  4.2 PRIVACY RIGHTS AND BRAZE CUSTOMERS </p></p> <p><p>  Braze customers may collect Personal Data through their websites or applications and send that data to the Braze Services. Where you wish to enforce any of your rights in respect of such data, we encourage you to contact the customer who provides you with the Customer Application, as this will be the quickest way to have your request processed. Where you submit a request about a Braze customer and you are able to identify the customer, we forward your request to the customer to handle. </p></p> <p><p>  4.3 MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS </p></p> <p><p>  You have the right to opt-out of any marketing communications that we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by visiting the <a href="https://www.braze.com/company/legal/preferences" target="_blank"> Braze Preference Centre </a>, or by using the contact details provided under the <a href="https://www.braze.com/privacy#contact_us" target="_blank"> How to Contact Us </a> heading below. </p></p> <p><p>  Authorised users of the Services may exercise this right through setting options available within the Services. </p></p> <p><p>  Where applicable, you may also opt-out through unsubscribe options available within the marketing communication itself.</p></p> <p><p>  Please note that opting-out of the receipt of marketing communications from us does not opt you out of receiving important business communications related to your current relationship with us, such as communications about event registrations, service announcements or security information.</p></p> <p><p>  4.4 COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES </p></p> <p><p>  You can manage your cookie preferences by visiting our <a href="https://www.braze.com/company/legal/preferences" target="_blank"> Cookie Consent Manager. </a> Please see our <a href="http://www.braze.com/cookies" target="_blank"> Cookie Policy </a> for further information on cookies and other tracking technologies.</p></p> <p><p>  4.5 CHAT TECHNOLOGIES</p></p> <p><p>  We use chat technologies provided by third-party vendors that employ cookies and software code to operate the chat features you can use to communicate with us through our Websites. We and such third-party vendors may monitor, record and use information from your interactions with our Websites. This information includes details you have shared through online chats, data on sections of the Website you have visited, your IP address and your general geographic information (e.g., city, state). This Personal Data may be processed for the purposes outlined in Section 2.2 of this Privacy Policy.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> PART V.  </strong><strong> IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EEA AND UK INDIVIDUALS </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you are from the EEA or the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Data described above will depend on the Personal Data concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p></p> <p><p>  However, we will normally collect Personal Data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Data to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Data from you or may otherwise need the Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> PART VI. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you are a California resident, this section applies to you in addition to the rest of the Privacy Policy. It provides more detail on how we collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information. For purposes of this Part VI, Personal Information has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“<strong> CCPA </strong>”). However, this Part VI does not apply:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To information exempted from the scope of the CCPA;</li><li>To Personal Information we collect, use, and share on behalf of our customers as a "service provider" under the CCPA for purposes of providing our Services to them. </li></ul></ul> <p><p>  6.1 YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</p></p> <p><p>  As a California resident, you have information, access, rectification/correction, erasure/deletion, and non-discrimination rights as described in Part IV (Your Privacy Rights). In addition, you have the right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of Personal Information as those terms are defined by the CCPA. </p></p> <p><p>  If you have appointed an authorized agent to act on your behalf, your authorized agent may request to exercise these rights on your behalf upon our verification of the agent’s identity and our receipt of a copy of a valid power of attorney given to your authorized agent pursuant to applicable California law. If you have not provided your agent with such a power of attorney, we may ask you and/or your agent to take additional steps permitted by law to verify that your request is authorized, such as information required to verify your identity and that you have given the authorized agent permission to submit the request. </p></p> <p><p>  6.2 CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT AND THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM THE DATA MAY BE SHARED </p></p> <p><p>  The following chart describes our practices currently in use and in use during the past 12 months. This chart summarizes the Personal Information we collect by reference to the statutory categories specified in the CCPA, and the categories of third parties to whom we may disclose it for a business purpose. These third parties are defined in Section 2.3 (Sharing and Disclosure of Information to Third Parties).
