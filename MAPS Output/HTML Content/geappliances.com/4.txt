We actively inventory our IT assets, deploy network security measures, and maintain business continuity and secure software development processes.  As appropriate, we use technology including encryption, back-ups, access management, security event logging, anti-virus software, and multi-factor authentication.  We cannot, however, guarantee the absolute security of your data.  We recommend that you use complex and unique passwords for your GEA accounts and for third-party accounts linked to them.

<b> 11.	HOW LONG WE RETAIN PERSONAL DATA </b>
</h3><p>  We strive to retain your personal data only for as long as is needed or permitted, based on the purpose for which it was collected.  If necessary, however, we may retain your personal data for longer periods of time, until set retention periods and deadlines expire (for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and/or accounting requirements set by a legislature, regulator, or other government authority), or for regulatory or safety purposes</p></div> <p><p>  To determine the appropriate duration of the retention of personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data and if we can attain our objectives by other means, as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and other applicable obligations.</p></p> <p><p>  Accordingly, we retain personal data for as long as you use our Services and for the purposes explained in this Privacy Statement, including maintaining a user account, to permit us to comply with regulatory requirements, to perform contracts, to complete transactions, to perform services, to communicate with you about safety issues, and for uses to which you consent. When you discontinue the use of our Services, we will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes and defend claims, as well as for any additional purpose based on the choices you have made (such as to receive marketing communications), the length of your relationship with us, your product purchases, and your service history.  This means we may retain your personal data even after you close your account with us.</p></p> <p><p>  Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying details.</p></p> <div><h3>
