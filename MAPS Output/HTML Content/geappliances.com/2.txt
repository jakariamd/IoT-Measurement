                    10. Product Availability and Pricing
                </h2><p>  
                    Orders are subject to product availability.  We try to fulfill all orders, but sometimes an item described on the Site is not available. If that happens, we may need to cancel your order or contact you for follow-up. We reserve the right to discontinue the sale of any product or service at any time without notice. We may decline or place quantity limits on your order at any time.
                </p></div> <p><p>  
                    In the event of a pricing or other error, we reserve the right to revoke offers, cancel orders and correct errors or omissions, including after an order has been placed.  Our acknowledgement of an order means that your order request has been received, not that the price or availability of an item has been confirmed.

                    11.  Purchases

                    If you wish to purchase products or services described on the Site, you will be asked to supply certain information which may include credit card and shipping information. You agree to pay all charges you incur (whether using your credit card or another payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred.
                </p><p>  
                    We are required by law to collect all applicable sales taxes. You authorize us to charge the applicable sales taxes to your credit card at the time of completion of order shipment.                </p></div> <p><p>  
                    For your security, the billing name and address on your credit card must match that of the information you submit. If the information provided does not match, your order may be delayed or cancelled.  We may preauthorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may affect your available credit line.                </p></p> <p><p>  
                    All billing and registration information provided by you must be accurate, complete and correct. By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the products and / or services that you have ordered. Receiving an order acknowledgement via email does not guarantee the acceptance of an order.                </p></p> <div><h2>  
                    12.  Limitations on Purchases
                </h2><p>  
                    We are not responsible for failure to fulfill orders due to causes beyond our control.  We reserve the right at any time after receiving your order to: (1) limit order quantities to reasonable amounts (in our sole discretion); (2) prohibit purchases by retailers, distributors, or resellers; (3) discontinue or refuse to offer any product or service; (4) impose conditions on any discount, coupon or promotion; and/or (5) bar any user from completing a transaction.  We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of an order that we've already charged you for, we'll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.
