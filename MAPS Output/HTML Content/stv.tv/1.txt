The key grounds upon which we rely are:</p><p>  • Where it is necessary for our <strong> legitimate interests </strong> and/or those of third parties with whom we share your data as described in this policy, and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (please see below for more info).</p><p>  • Where we have your <strong> consent </strong>.</p></div> <p><p>  • Where we need it to <strong> perform the contract </strong> we have with you.</p></p> <p><p>  • In order to comply with a <strong> legal or regulatory obligation </strong>.</p></p> <p><p>  The only circumstance in which we rely on consent as our basis for processing your personal data is when you agree to receive email marketing from STV.</p></p> <p><p>  In the table below we have set out a summary of our activities which involve the processing of your personal data and our legal bases for doing so.</p></p> <p><p>  Most commonly, we process your personal data on the basis that it is in our legitimate interests to do so, or the <strong> legitimate interests </strong> of third parties with whom we share your data and we explain what those interests are in the following table.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> 4) HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA SECURE? </strong></p><p>  The security of your data is important to us. We have technical and operational security measures in place internally within STV, and externally with our authorised suppliers to protect the data we collect, use and store, against unauthorised access or disclosure; improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction or loss.</p><p>  We limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p></div> <p><p>  However, please be aware that the sending of information through the internet is not completely secure. We do not guarantee the security of your data transmitted to and from our Services over the internet, and you accept the inherent security implications of using the internet.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> 5) SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA </strong></p><p>  We share your data in the following circumstances:</p><p>  When we engage data processing companies to act on our behalf from time to time to help manage your data, to provide analysis and to deliver specific functionality. We require those we share it with to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law and our strict instructions. Please note that some of these companies may be either located and/or have servers which are located outside the European Economic Area (please see below for further detail).</p></div> <p><p>  If whilst entering one of our competitions you have expressly agreed that you are happy for us to do so, we will share some of your details with the prize donor or competition sponsor of that competition. Please note that any shared data will then be subject to the privacy policy of any prize donor or competition sponsor.</p></p> <p><p>  Where we are required or permitted to do so by law, or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party or our users (which may include steps taken arising from a breach of our Terms of Use).</p></p> <p><p>  In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer, or new business partner.</p></p> <p><p>  If you subscribe to STV Player+, we use a third party payment services provider, Stripe, to process your payment card details on our behalf.

For example, STV use Stripe, who is based in the US, to process STV Player payment transactions using Standard Contractual Clauses. Stripe’s privacy policy can be found here: <a href=" https://stripe.com/gb/privacy" target="_blank"> https://stripe.com/gb/privacy </a></li></ul></div> <p><p>  Please <strong> Contact us </strong> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> 6) MARKETING </strong></p><p>  We will only send you marketing emails about STV’s Services where you have given us consent to do so. Some of these communications are issued regularly to keep you up-to-date, while others may be prompted by specific events, or your most recent activity on our STV Player. Please note that these communications may be personalised for you on the basis of information you have provided to us, and your use of our Services. Note that we may use your Registration, Technical and/or Analytical Data to form a view on what we think may be of interest to you.

That will be your choice, and at your discretion. To subsequently opt-out of receiving any such communications from a prize donor or sponsor, you will need to contact them directly. Please note that STV is not responsible for the communications or the content of any communications you receive from any such third party.</p></p> <p><p>  If you download one of our mobile apps then we may send you messages, including marketing messages, via push notifications. You can disable these at any time by altering the notification settings on your mobile device or by uninstalling the app.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> 7) LINKS TO OTHER SITES </strong></p><p>  To inform and enhance your experience when on our sites, or using our Services, we provide a number of links to third party websites who apply their own privacy policies. Please note that this Privacy Policy will not apply to any such third party website. We do not control such third party websites or have any responsibility for them.</p><p>  <strong> 8) YOUR RIGHTS </strong></p><p>  You have the right to:</p><p>  • <strong> Request access </strong> to a copy of the personal data we hold about you (commonly known as a “data subject access request or “SAR””).</p></div> <p><p>  • <strong> Request correction </strong> of any inaccurate personal data that we hold about you. Note that you can do most of this by amending your details via your account profile page.</p></p> <p><p>  • <strong> Request erasure of your personal data </strong>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with a legal obligation. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p></p> <p><p>  • <strong> Object to processing </strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information.</p></p> <p><p>  • <strong> Request restriction of processing of your personal data </strong>. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p></p> <p><p>  • <strong> Withdraw consent </strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p></p> <p><p>  • <strong> Make a complaint </strong> at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (<a href="https://www.ico.org.uk" target="_blank"> www.ico.org.uk </a>).

Whenever you use our Services data may be collected through the use of cookies and similar technologies. </strong></p></div> <p><p>  <strong> In this policy we explain what cookies are, the types of cookies we use on our Services and what we use them for; that other people may use cookies on our Services; how you can opt out of viewing more relevant ads based on data we collect, including from cookies and how you can manage and control cookies. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> If, after reading this policy, you are still struggling with cookies or want additional information on cookies we use on our Services, feel free to contact  </strong><strong> enquiries@stv.tv </strong>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> By using our Services, without changing your web browser settings, we’ll assume you’re happy to the use of cookies and similar technologies as described it in this policy. You can change your web browser settings at any time. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Please note that we update our Cookie Policy from time to time, so please take a fresh read through every so often. If we make significant changes, we will make that clear on our Services, or by some other means of contact such as email. </strong></p></p> <p><p>  This Cookie Policy was last updated on 30 November 2018.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> WHAT ARE COOKIES AND WHAT ARE THEY USED FOR? </strong></p><p>  A Cookie is a small amount of data which often contains a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone web browser when you visit a website or application (“App”). If your web browser settings allow it, such cookies are stored on your device’s hard drive and are read by the website or App on each subsequent visit.</p><p>  When you use our Services, the pages you view (along with a cookie) are downloaded to your device. This enables us to find out whether a device (and probably its user) has used our Services before.</p></div> <p><p>  Cookies do many different jobs. They let you move from web page to page efficiently. They allow us to collect data about your experience of our Services which helps us improve the performance of our Services, personalise your experience and make your visits and use of our Services as straightforward, efficient and enjoyable as possible. They can also help to ensure that adverts (ads) you see online are more relevant to your interests.</p></p> <p><p>  Some cookies are erased when you close the browser on your website or app. Others stay longer, sometimes forever, and are saved onto your device so they're there when you come back.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> WHAT ARE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND WHEN ARE THEY USED? </strong></p><p>  Local storage performs very similar functions to cookies. It involves the storage of local files on the hard drive of the device you use to access our STV News App and STV Player App on AppleiOS and Android devices.</p><p>  Like cookies, local storage can be sessional or perpetual.</p><p>  Like cookies, local storage does many different jobs. It allows us, for example, to identify you as “signed” in and keeps you in a signed in state each time you use the App; to remember “resume” points in videos you have watched; and to manage parental control functions.</p></div> <p><p>  These locally stored files are essential to the operation of our Apps. It is not currently possible to opt out or remove these files from the device without deleting the App(s). For AppleiOS and Android, YouView, Samsung, Freeview, Roku, Now TV, Chromecast devices we send anonymous data to Adobe, our analytical processor, to track usage and for quality purposes.</p></p> <p><p>  We use Facebook Pixel on our Services. Facebook Pixel is a small bit of code that is used in conjunction with cookies. Facebook Pixel allows Facebook to capture certain information about your journey across our Services such as the pages you visit, the type of content you view and how much of that content you view. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information on how we process information collected via tracking pixels.</p></p> <p><p>  When we talk about <strong> “cookies” </strong> in this policy we mean cookies or similar technologies.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES ARE USED? </strong></p><p>  The following types of cookies are used on our Services.</p><p>  <strong> (i) Strictly Necessary </strong> cookies enable you to move around <strong> www.stv.tv </strong> and our Apps and to use their features. They allow us, for example, to;</p><p>  recognise which users are registered users of our Services;</p><p>  identify you as signed in to our Services and keep you signed in throughout your visits so that you don’t need to sign in each and every time you visit;</p></div> <p><p>  remember security settings, such as parental controls, which restricts access to certain content.</p></p> <p><p>  If your device or web browser is not set to receive them, aspects of our Services will not work for you. Disabled parental controls, for example, will not work, nor will our Services be able to recognise you as a registered user, and you may not be able to use the STV Player or view our Live or On Demand content.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> (ii) Functional </strong> cookies allow us to remember choices you made previously, when using our Services, as well as details, like your user name. That helps personalise your use of our Services and make it more efficient and enjoyable. Examples of the things functional cookies do include;</p></p> <div><p>  allowing you access to your stored information if you have joined STV;</p><p>  remembering your settings on your visits to our Services;</p><p>  enabling us to serve the appropriate regionalised service relevant to your location;</p><p>  remembering your place in a video if you leave the "On Demand" section of our Services at STV Player before you've finished watching a programme, so that you can pick up where you left off the next time; and</p><p>  limiting the number of times that some ads which you may view on our Services are shown to you within a short space of time. This is sometimes called “frequency capping”.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> (iii) Analytical </strong> cookies are used in analytical services provided by other organisations on our behalf to help us to profile people who use our Services and to better understand how they use them.</p></p> <div><p>  Analytical services allow us to;</p><ul>  <li>recognise your web browser or device if you have used our Services before;</li><li>count the number of visitors to our Services;</li><li>analyse patterns of behaviour among our users- see what parts of our Services are most popular;</li><li>test different versions of a page or feature and how information is presented to you to see which one works best;</li><li>identify what programmes and ads have been watched online;</li><li>provide you with recommendations- for example, if we see that people who watched a programme you are watching also watched another programme, we might recommend that other programme to you;</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>deliver more relevant ads to you; and</li><li>improve our Services and deliver a better user experience.</li></ul></ul> <div><p>  <strong> Combining Data from analytical cookies with other data </strong></p><p>  If you provide personal data to us, such as your name, address, email address or date of birth, when using our Services, we may combine that with data we get from our analytical services and from data we collect from <strong> Experian </strong> to analyse how our Services are used. Where combined data can be used to identify you, we use it only in accordance with our <strong> Privacy Policy </strong>.</p><p>  We may use that data to (i) send you newsletters that might be of interest to you where you have opted in to receive such communications and (ii) deliver to you ads across our Services (including in our newsletters) that are more relevant to your interests. You may opt out of (or back in to) receiving more relevant ads from us based on Combined Data at your Preference Centre. Please note that receiving more relevant ads from us on the basis of Combined Data is not OBA. WE describe OBA and how you can opt out of it in the <strong> (iv) Advertising cookies </strong> section below.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board </strong></p><p>  We are currently participating in a research project carried out by the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB) to gather anonymised statistics about the usage of media players. The aim is to understand the number of users and the extent of use of these players and the content within them. Several other major broadcasters are also participating in the project. BARB has chosen Kantar Media to collect this data through the use of cookies that are placed on your device when you use STV Player. All data is collected anonymously and will not be used by us for any other purpose but for this project.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> (iv) Advertising </strong> cookies are set by our advertising partners. Some have functional purposes such as capping the number of times you see an ad, but most enable Online Behavioural Advertising “OBA” (also known as ‘behavioural targeting' or ‘interest based advertising') which delivers ads to you that are more relevant to your interests.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> (a) OBA cookies remember a user’s web browsing activity. </strong> Shared interests, based upon, and inferred from, the websites you have visited, are grouped together. Ads you view will be determined by these interests. For example, if you visit a sports’ section of a website and searched other websites for sport, that interest – together with the shared interests of other web users - might be grouped together as ‘sport loving” and you may be served ads for sport and sports’ related goods or services.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> (b) Personalised retargeting </strong> is a form of OBA that enables our advertising partners to show you ads based on your online browsing away from our Services. Therefore, when you use our Services, you may see ads for products or services from websites you have visited away from our Services. These cookies will usually be set by advertising partners that are working with many advertisers and ad agencies. Our main advertising partners are detailed in the <strong> Managing Advertising Cookies </strong> section below.</p></p> <p><p>  **(c) Advertising on third party sites. The information that Facebook captures through Facebook Pixel enables Facebook to provide us with social media metrics and to target promotions about our Services to you when you browse Facebook and Instagram.</p></p> <p><p>  Without these cookies, online ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> (v) Other organisations’ cookies </strong> may be set on pages of our Services where we include embedded content from other organisations like <strong> Twitter </strong>, <strong> YouTube </strong>, <strong> Instagram </strong> and <strong> Facebook </strong>. We cannot access or control these cookies. You should check the relevant organisation’s website for information about them.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> WAYS TO MANAGE AND CONTROL YOUR COOKIES </strong></p><p>  There are various ways that you can manage and control your cookies and we outline them below.</p><p>  <strong> MANAGING COOKIES IN YOUR WEB BROWSER </strong></p><p>  You can block most cookies by activating the settings on your web browser that allow you to refuse the setting of some or all cookies. However, if you block all cookies you may not be able to access all or parts of our services, or you may experience reduced functionality when accessing certain services. Unless you have adjusted your web browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our Services.</p></div> <p><p>  The links below take you to the website of some of the major web browsers where you can find out more about how to manage cookies they set.</p></p> <p><p>  Google Chrome: <strong> http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647 </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Android: <strong> http://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392971?hl=en-GB </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Firefox: <strong> https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/control-center-site-privacy-and-security-firefox </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Microsoft Edge: <strong> https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-microsoft-edge-and-privacy </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Internet Explorer: <strong> https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Safari OSX: <strong> https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Safari iOS: <strong> https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265 </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Blackberry: <strong> http://uk.blackberry.com/legal/privacy-policy.html#types-info-d </strong></p></p> <p><p>  With new devices being created all the time, including tablets and phones, it is not possible to list every web browser for every device. It may be best to consult the manufacturer’s websites for further instructions regarding cookies.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Do Not Track (DNT) </strong></p><p>  Do Not Track is a feature offered by some web browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, (for example by advertising networks, social networks and analytic companies). Our Services do not currently respond to DNT requests.</p><p>  <strong> MANAGING ANALYTICS COOKIES </strong></p><p>  Listed below are the analytics providers we use on our Services. Following the links will enable you to opt out of their cookies. You should note that opting out of analytical cookies will inhibit our ability to learn what you like and don’t like about our Services and improve them.</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> MANAGING ADVERTISING COOKIES </strong></p><p>  You can turn other organisations’ advertising cookies off. Doing that won’t mean you will receive less advertising when you use our Services; just that the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p><p>  We have set out below our advertising partners who set cookies on our Services.</p><p>  <strong> FINDING OUT MORE </strong></p><p>  To find out more about cookies, including how to disable/enable them visit <strong> www.aboutcookies.org.uk </strong>.

So we have a few simple House Rules which we ask you to respect. We reserve the right to take down or edit anything that we consider breaks these rules. These apply to any kind of contribution you make, not just to words but to pictures and videos as well.</p><p>  Stay on the topic at hand.</p></div> <p><p>  Don't post anonymously.</p></p> <p><p>  Respect others; disagree as strongly as you like with someone but don’t spoil your argument by attacking or insulting them personally. That also means no hate speech, profanities or what we perceive as discrimination against groups or individuals.</p></p> <p><p>  Solid facts always back up an argument; so be as accurate as you can. Better still, leave a link to where you got the information.</p></p> <p><p>  Don’t include personal information (such as addresses or phone numbers), yours or anybody else’s.</p></p> <p><p>  Keep it legal – that means not defamatory, in breach of copyright, in contempt of court or in breach of privacy laws (see 5, above). Remember you are responsible for what you say.</p></p> <p><p>  No spam, advertising, spurious links or anything misleading.</p></p> <p><p>  We (that is, STV) welcome your views on our own products and services but we will delete material that is incorrect or just plain abusive.</p></p> <p><p>  If you see anything on our Services that you feel should not be there, please click on the word "Flag" on the Comment to alert us to it.
