    Mozilla Stumbler (Stumbler) is an open-source Android application that
    collects GPS data to improve the 
    <a href="https://location.services.mozilla.com" target="_blank"> Mozilla Location Service </a>.
    Stumbler (and authorized applications that use
    <a href="https://ichnaea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/geosubmit2.html" target="_blank"> the geosubmit API </a>)
    <em> automatically </em> records location data when the app is open and you move
    around. In addition to the data MLS collects, Stumbler also receives your
    device’s GPS location and additional technical data, like your device’s
    altitude and speed.
</p></div> <p><p>  
    The information is stored locally on your device until an internet
    connection is established. The data is then deleted from your device and
    sent to Mozilla. If you do not want to report data to Mozilla, you can
    delete the Android app or change your Firefox for Android (versions 69 and
    earlier) preference under Settings / Privacy / Data Choices.

    We aggregate location points sent to Mozilla from users around the world in
    our
    <a href="https://location.services.mozilla.com/map" target="_blank"> data map </a>.
    Location points are blurred to promote anonymity.
