</div><div>  [phone rings] 

</div><div>  00:03
</div><div>  [air whooshes] 

</div><div>  00:04
</div><div>  Hey, Tommy! 

</div><div>  00:04
</div><div>  Thanks so much for joining us. 

</div><div>  00:06
</div><div>  I've seen some lovely threads on Twitter 

</div><div>  00:08
</div><div>  that people have put up of everyday things 

</div><div>  00:10
</div><div>  that they've been missing. 

</div><div>  00:12
</div><div>  What are some of those for you? 

</div></div> <div><div>  00:14
</div><div>  I don't think I'm not missing any of it. 

</div><div>  00:16
</div><div>  No? 

</div><div>  00:16
</div><div>  You seem to be happy! 

</div><div>  00:17
</div><div>  I've thrived in the lockdown, I think. 

</div><div>  00:20
</div><div>  I've just taken it. 

</div><div>  00:22
</div><div>  I'm lacking a little bit in facial maintenance and stuff, 

</div><div>  00:26
</div><div>  so maybe that can be an after lockdown thing 

</div><div>  00:29
</div><div>  where I might just have a trim up 

</div></div> <div><div>  00:32
</div><div>  and maybe look a bit more human again. 

</div><div>  00:35
</div><div>  But you know what? Things are nice. 

</div><div>  00:37
</div><div>  I like going out and getting coffee 

</div><div>  00:38
</div><div>  or going for a drive and stuff 

</div><div>  00:39
</div><div>  but if I were to think about it, I'm absolutely fine. 

</div><div>  00:44
</div><div>  [both laughing] 

</div><div>  00:45
</div><div>  I'm doing fine here. 

</div><div>  00:47
</div><div>  [laughs] I love it. 

</div></div> <div><div>  00:48
</div><div>  Actually, with the hair, you're just on point for lockdown. 

</div><div>  00:51
</div><div>  You don't have to worry about the haircuts or anything. 

</div><div>  00:53
</div><div>  Well, exactly. 

</div><div>  00:54
</div><div>  Maintenance has been at a very low level, really. 

</div><div>  00:56
</div><div>  It's just the problem comes when it gets to lunchtime 

</div><div>  00:59
</div><div>  and Claire points out 

</div><div>  01:00
</div><div>  I've got a bit of granola left in my beard. 

</div></div> <div><div>  01:04
</div><div>  We started strong on the TV front, 

</div><div>  01:06
</div><div>  and then, it's a world away, 

</div><div>  01:09
</div><div>  but I think we'll definitely get started again. 

</div><div>  01:13
</div><div>  We watched all three seasons of Ozark in about, 

</div><div>  01:16
</div><div>  I think that should really take you a long time 

</div><div>  01:18
</div><div>  but it took us about a week. 

</div><div>  01:20
</div><div>  Oh wow! 

</div><div>  01:21
</div></div> <div><div>  They're long episodes as well. 

</div></div> <div><div>  01:22
</div><div>  Yeah, we overdid it. 

</div><div>  01:25
</div><div>  So now we need something else. 

</div><div>  01:29
</div><div>  I thought I would cook a little bit more. 

</div><div>  01:33
</div><div>  I did say to Claire, I said to my wife that, 

</div><div>  01:36
</div><div>  maybe I could just help you cook 

</div><div>  01:39
</div><div>  or make dinner and everything, 

</div><div>  01:40
</div><div>  and I did one meal and then decided, 

</div><div>  01:43
</div><div>  this probably isn't for me and I haven't tried it since, 

</div></div> <div><div>  01:45
</div><div>  so that one started and stopped pretty sharpish. 

</div><div>  01:49
</div><div>  It's funny that, isn't it, that you think, 

</div><div>  01:51
</div><div>  'I'm not doing these hobbies 

</div><div>  01:52
</div><div>  or these things because I don't have time', 

</div><div>  01:54
</div><div>  but then you have time, you try it, and you're like, 

</div><div>  01:56
</div><div>  'yeah, I'm just not doing this because'-- 

</div><div>  01:58
</div><div>  Yeah, there was a reason why I didn't do this stuff. 

</div></div> <div><div>  02:00
</div><div>  It's actually really funny as well when you think, 

</div><div>  02:02
</div><div>  I mean we've got all the time in the world at the moment 

</div><div>  02:04
</div><div>  but then you have days where you feel like 

</div><div>  02:06
</div><div>  there was no time. 

</div><div>  02:07
</div><div>  I don't know [mumbles], like, dust around or something 

</div><div>  02:10
</div><div>  but then the day's gone. 

</div><div>  02:11
</div><div>  Now on the golfing front, what have you been doing 

</div></div> <div><div>  02:13
</div><div>  to keep the game sharp 

</div><div>  02:14
</div><div>  or what have you been managing to do? 

</div><div>  02:16
</div><div>  Well I don't know about sharp. 

</div><div>  02:17
</div><div>  But I do, I mean I have a couple of things 

</div><div>  02:20
</div><div>  in my house: stocking up balls, 

</div><div>  02:22
</div><div>  I have a simulator and a putting green. 

</div><div>  02:24
</div><div>  And I've enjoyed doing that. 

</div><div>  02:26
</div><div>  I've not done it with any intensity 

</div></div> <div><div>  02:29
</div><div>  or anything like that 

</div><div>  02:30
</div><div>  but it's been nice just being able to like clip some balls 

</div><div>  02:34
</div><div>  or at times or mess around in there with kids. 

</div><div>  02:37
</div><div>  And well, basically, like, kept in contact with everyone 

</div><div>  02:41
</div><div>  coaches and stuff and and friends from the tour. 

</div><div>  02:47
</div><div>  Yeah, so that's that's been that's been nice. 

</div><div>  02:50
</div></div> <div><div>  I've watched a few golf programs. 

</div></div> <div><div>  02:54
</div><div>  If I can learn anything. 

</div><div>  02:55
</div><div>  The reruns. 

</div><div>  02:56
</div><div>  Yeah, there's plenty of reruns going on. 

</div><div>  02:59
</div><div>  The majors have really been shifted around 

</div><div>  03:00
</div><div>  and canceled in terms of the Open. 

</div><div>  03:03
</div><div>  As a Brit how gut wrenching was that? 

</div><div>  03:07
</div><div>  Yeah, I think it was. 

</div><div>  03:11
</div><div>  That was clearly such a hard decision for the RNA 

</div></div> <div><div>  03:14
</div><div>  and a lot of thought went into it. 

</div><div>  03:20
</div><div>  The Open hasn't been played this year 

</div><div>  03:21
</div><div>  but I think one of the key messages 

</div><div>  03:22
</div><div>  was that the 149th Open will take place 

</div><div>  03:25
</div><div>  it's just a year down the line 

</div><div>  03:27
</div><div>  and I think it was important to look at it that way. 

</div><div>  03:31
</div><div>  Again, we've never really 

</div><div>  03:33
</div></div> <div><div>  been in this situation before 

</div><div>  03:34
</div><div>  and I don't think there's any right or wrong, 

</div><div>  03:35
</div><div>  and I certainly would like to be one of them 

</div><div>  03:40
</div><div>  making the decisions about everything at the moment. 

</div><div>  03:42
</div><div>  So, you know, you just respect whatever the decision is 

</div><div>  03:45
</div><div>  and we'll still get to play the Open, 

</div><div>  03:48
</div><div>  it's just a year later. 

</div></div> <div><div>  03:49
</div><div>  Starting so late and everything being jam packed 

</div><div>  03:51
</div><div>  in together potentially as well, 

</div><div>  03:52
</div><div>  [talking over each other] 

</div><div>  03:56
</div><div>  I mean, mentally, to go from major to major to major, 

</div><div>  04:01
</div><div>  and potentially with Ryder Cup as well, 

</div><div>  04:02
</div><div>  I mean, there's going to be a lot, right? 

</div><div>  04:05
</div><div>  Well, yeah and it feels like sort of silly to 

</div></div> <div><div>  04:08
</div><div>  say that it will be really mentally straining to 

</div><div>  04:11
</div><div>  have a few majors at the same time and eratic but it will. 

</div><div>  04:15
</div><div>  It's just, it's different. 

</div><div>  04:16
</div><div>  It's competition at the end of the day 

</div><div>  04:19
</div><div>  and the majors take a lot out of you and 

</div><div>  04:22
</div><div>  especially if you happen to play well, 

</div><div>  04:26
</div><div>  which, of course, is what everybody wants to 

</div></div> <div><div>  04:27
</div><div>  do everybody wants to be up there in contention 

</div><div>  04:30
</div><div>  but that really will, you'll be tired at the end of it. 

</div><div>  04:34
</div><div>  But we don't know whether we'll be playing the U.S. Open 

</div><div>  04:40
</div><div>  and thinking, 

</div><div>  04:41
</div><div>  'Oh, this is amazing, just to be playing golf'. 

</div><div>  04:42
</div><div>  But in real competition mode it'll be, again like you 

</div><div>  04:46
</div><div>  don't really know how we're going to feel 

</div></div> <div><div>  04:47
</div><div>  but you know I would quite happily take being 

</div><div>  04:52
</div><div>  knackered in December and haven't done well in them. 

</div><div>  04:56
</div><div>  Yeah, for sure. 

</div><div>  04:57
</div><div>  Let's talk Ryder Cup, because that's build 

</div><div>  05:00
</div><div>  at the moment to still be in 

</div><div>  05:01
</div><div>  that same slot but one of the rumors, I should say 

</div><div>  05:04
</div><div>  that have been going around, is maybe a fan-less Ryder Cup. 

</div></div> <div><div>  05:07
</div><div>  What are your thoughts on that? 

</div><div>  05:10
</div><div>  It would be strange. 

</div><div>  05:13
</div><div>  I did hear that and I was kind of against it straightaway. 

</div><div>  05:17
</div><div>  But also, you know, still I think sport does have 

</div><div>  05:22
</div><div>  it's place in society or something as big as 

</div><div>  05:25
</div><div>  the Ryder Cup would be a nice torch for like a change of 

</div><div>  05:31
</div><div>  the times and seen as getting back to a better place 

</div></div> <div><div>  05:34
</div><div>  but it would seem, I've only played one, 

</div><div>  05:37
</div><div>  but after that one, it would seem very odd to play 

</div><div>  05:40
</div><div>  in a very sort of quiet atmosphere. 

</div><div>  05:45
</div><div>  And I don't know, if I was to give my honest opinion, 

</div><div>  05:48
</div><div>  I would say it doesn't really feel right without fans. 

</div><div>  05:52
</div><div>  But if they want to play, 

</div><div>  05:53
</div><div>  again, I'm not going to be that person that says, 'no'. 

</div></div> <div><div>  05:55
</div><div>  'No I'm good on that?' 

</div><div>  05:57
</div><div>  [both laugh] 

</div><div>  05:58
</div><div>  Yeah I completely get that. 

</div><div>  06:00
</div><div>  On the one hand the fans make it, on the other hand, 

</div><div>  06:01
</div><div>  you want it to be this standing torch of resilience. 

</div><div>  06:04
</div><div>  Sure. 

</div><div>  06:05
</div><div>  And every time the Ryder Cup comes around 

</div><div>  06:08
</div><div>  it's the biggest sporting occasion in the world by miles 

</div></div> <div><div>  06:12
</div><div>  and we're lucky enough to play in it 

</div><div>  06:14
</div><div>  but part of why it's so amazingly great is the fans as well. 

</div><div>  06:18
</div><div>  So, like I said, 

</div><div>  06:21
</div><div>  both sides of the story are: 

</div><div>  06:23
</div><div>  it will be amazing to be playing golf 

</div><div>  06:24
</div><div>  and be amazing to say the Ryder Cup is being played. 

</div><div>  06:29
</div><div>  But without fans it just seems a little bit weird. 

</div></div> <div><div>  06:31
</div><div>  Now you mentioned that you've only played one Ryder Cup, 

</div><div>  06:33
</div><div>  obviously that went pretty well for you. Nice memories. 

</div><div>  06:37
</div><div>  How much have you in this period of being at home, 

</div><div>  06:40
</div><div>  had a chance to reflect on the last few years? 

</div><div>  06:44
</div><div>  Because it has been a little bit of a whirlwind for you. 

</div><div>  06:46
</div><div>  Have you really had time to digest everything 

</div></div> <div><div>  06:49
</div><div>  and think on it? 

</div><div>  06:51
</div><div>  Well yeah the last two or three years have been great and 

</div><div>  06:54
</div><div>  played very well, very consistently. 

</div><div>  06:57
</div><div>  I would say I'm more of a 

</div><div>  07:00
</div><div>  'look forwards rather than backwards'. 

</div><div>  07:06
</div><div>  It's nice to look back on a few memories and 

</div><div>  07:08
</div><div>  I think with some of the replays that have been on, 

</div></div> <div><div>  07:10
</div><div>  say the Ryder Cup in Paris or 

</div><div>  07:13
</div><div>  I actually watched the Open from last year, the other day, 

</div><div>  07:15
</div><div>  which I did not want to watch at all, anytime. 

</div><div>  07:19
</div><div>  'I'm not gonna watch that' or 'I don't want to watch it', 

</div><div>  07:22
</div><div>  but you know I watched that and 

</div><div>  07:24
</div><div>  it's good watching golf, actually. 

</div><div>  07:26
</div><div>  Even, other tournaments that you weren't part of 

</div></div> <div><div>  07:28
</div><div>  and watch how they unfolded 

</div><div>  07:30
</div><div>  and I feel like having a chance to watch because 

</div><div>  07:33
</div><div>  in general I kind of play week in, week out 

</div><div>  07:36
</div><div>  and when you do get away from it, 

</div><div>  07:38
</div><div>  you don't really feel like watching golf too much. 

</div><div>  07:41
</div><div>  You just want to get a little bit of rest from it 

</div><div>  07:42
</div><div>  so actually watching some tournaments and reruns 

</div></div> <div><div>  07:45
</div><div>  and seeing how tournament unfold or 

</div><div>  07:46
</div><div>  seeing what the winners do. 

</div><div>  07:48
</div><div>  And how they cross the line is actually, it can be 

</div><div>  07:52
</div><div>  quite educational, sometimes it's like Tiger's winning by 

</div><div>  07:55
</div><div>  15 or something and then you know you 

</div><div>  07:57
</div><div>  don't really learn too much from that. 

</div><div>  07:58
</div><div>  It was very, very good. 

</div></div> <div><div>  08:00
</div><div>  You just enjoy watching? [laughs] 

</div><div>  08:01
</div><div>  Watching, I probably wouldn't have won that one. 

</div><div>  08:05
</div><div>  What are some of the things that have stood out for you? 

</div><div>  08:07
</div><div>  Like, it's interesting you say that when you watch it 

</div><div>  08:09
</div><div>  you're getting some things from it. 

</div><div>  08:11
</div><div>  What are some of those things that stand out? 

</div><div>  08:14
</div><div>  I think if you're ever watching yourself I think you just 

</div></div> <div><div>  08:16
</div><div>  watch your mannerisms or the way you think. 

</div><div>  08:21
</div><div>  I feel like I should remember some of the shots 

</div><div>  08:23
</div><div>  but I don't know how I was thinking over them. 

</div><div>  08:24
</div><div>  I remember, hitting the shots but actually going back 

</div><div>  08:26
</div><div>  and looking: 'what was I thinking there?' 

</div><div>  08:27
</div><div>  or 'what was I doing?' 

</div><div>  08:30
</div><div>  and in general, it's good just to watch how you were. 

</div></div> <div><div>  08:32
</div><div>  And then the tournaments you do, watching the majors, 

</div><div>  08:36
</div><div>  it's just interesting to watch just how sort of 

</div><div>  08:41
</div><div>  volatile the leaderboards can be at times. 

</div><div>  08:43
</div><div>  And sometimes things just open up for the guy that won, 

</div><div>  08:47
</div><div>  sometimes it's somebody that just plays that good, 

</div><div>  08:49
</div><div>  that nobody can beat him 

</div><div>  08:52
</div><div>  and sometimes it just doesn't happen for somebody else 

</div></div> <div><div>  08:55
</div><div>  but it's interesting just watching. 

</div><div>  08:58
</div><div>  Because when you're in those positions, 

</div><div>  09:01
</div><div>  you either win or you don't. 

</div><div>  09:03
</div><div>  And then you try and look back 

</div><div>  09:05
</div><div>  and think what could you have done better. 

</div><div>  09:06
</div><div>  But you never really look at what everybody else did 

</div><div>  09:08
</div><div>  or what happened to them and stuff 

</div></div> <div><div>  09:09
</div><div>  so it's interesting watching you know a bunch of 

</div><div>  09:12
</div><div>  guys go at it. 

</div><div>  09:13
</div><div>  Yeah, it's tough to see the big picture 

</div><div>  09:15
</div><div>  when you're trying to win the tournament itself. 

</div><div>  09:18
</div><div>  I'm gonna finish up on your caddy Ian 'Fino' Finnis, 

</div><div>  09:22
</div><div>  he's been doing some great work for 

</div><div>  09:24
</div><div>  the European Caddie Association. 

</div></div> <div><div>  09:28
</div><div>  I'll let you tell a little bit more about that 

</div><div>  09:30
</div><div>  and what he's been doing and how people can get involved. 

</div><div>  09:33
</div><div>  Fino just decided he wanted to help his, 

</div><div>  09:35
</div><div>  our own industry and the caddies that were struggling 

</div><div>  09:38
</div><div>  and completely understood what they're going through 

</div><div>  09:40
</div><div>  when we started out and I was playing terrible 

</div></div> <div><div>  09:43
</div><div>  and you know not making much 

</div><div>  09:44
</div><div>  and he originally just came up with the idea, 

</div><div>  09:47
</div><div>  he was going to try and get a few prizes do like a bit 

</div><div>  09:49
</div><div>  of a raffle and an auction. 

</div><div>  09:51
</div><div>  I think it was 10 pound, a ticket. 

</div><div>  09:54
</div><div>  I think his first one raised, 30,000, 

</div><div>  09:59
</div><div>  which is, I mean, just the response was amazing 

</div></div> <div><div>  10:01
</div><div>  and then it went that good that 

</div><div>  10:03
</div><div>  he thought he would do it again, 

</div><div>  10:07
</div><div>  and there's so many golfers and caddies 

</div><div>  10:12
</div><div>  and members of the golf world that have got involved. 

</div><div>  10:14
</div><div>  Yeah this is brilliant and if you want to get involved, 

</div><div>  10:16
</div><div>  check out Fino on Twitter. He's @FinoEFC. 

</div><div>  10:20
</div><div>  All right, well, Tommy, thank you so much. 

</div></div> <div><div>  10:24
</div><div>  Keep enjoying lock down. 

</div><div>  10:28
</div><div>  If it starts turning sour, I'll let you know 

</div><div>  10:30
</div><div>  but I'm good so far. 

</div><div>  10:31
</div><div>  [laughs together] 

</div><div>  10:32
</div><div>  Sounds great. We'll speak to soon. 

</div><div>  10:35
</div><div>  Thanks, Henni. Thank you.
