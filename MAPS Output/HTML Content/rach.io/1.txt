If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p></p> <div><h3>  Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h3><p>  You may choose to limit the information we share with partners through cookies and similar technologies by setting your browser to block certain cookies or notify you when a cookie is set.
