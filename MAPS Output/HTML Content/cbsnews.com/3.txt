          In July 2021, Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated, leaving a power vacuum seized upon by rival gangs that now effectively run the capital city of Port-au-Prince.

CBS Reports explores Haiti’s current crisis, fueled in part by American firepower, and the inspiring stories amidst the anarchy of those fighting to fulfill Haiti’s promise.

After the documentary’s release, a spokesperson from Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry's office provided the following statement: "We don't deal with gangs. We don't talk to them. We don't negotiate with them. We don't even want to sit with them."
