Some of this information is collected when they make a purchase or sign up for a subscription, some of it is collected as they use the Products and Services. Collecting this sort of information can pose privacy issues for you, us, and the End-users/Customers.

We recognize that our Retail Partners come in different shapes and sizes. Some may have extensive privacy programs of their own, with different legal obligations depending upon the jurisdictions in which they operate. However, because you are ambassadors for our Products and Services, it is important to us that you meet certain minimum standards and treat the Personal Data of Customers and End-Users with respect, in addition to your compliance with all Applicable Privacy Laws.</p></p> <div><p>  The Basic Commitments</p><p>  Although the requirements of Applicable Privacy Laws vary, we expect all of our Retail Partners to be able to make the following commitments:</p><ul>  <li>To Process the Personal Data of Customers and End-Users only at their request, in accordance with an agreement that we or you have with them (such as an End-User Licence Agreement or Terms of Purchase), or as required by law.</li><li>To implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks to Customers and End-Users that are presented by the Processing.</li><li>To take all reasonable steps to ensure that only authorized personnel with suitable training and privacy obligations and restrictions have access to Customer and End-User Personal Data.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Only to hire third parties to assist in the delivery of Products or the performance of the Services in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws.</li><li>To avoid doing anything that may place you, us or Customers in breach of applicable Privacy Laws and will tell us if our instructions to you run contrary to what the Applicable Data Privacy Laws permit.</li><li>To assist us to fulfil any requests received by Customers or End-Users to exercise their rights under Applicable Privacy Laws, or to respond to any requests or queries from Privacy Regulators; including cooperating any request from a by a Customer or End-User to remove your access to any project, system or any other mechanism by which Person Data is collected, to delete any Personal Data in your possession that, and to cooperate with us in doing the same;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To inform us immediately of any Data Breach or suspected Data Breach that might compromise Customer or End-User Personal Data or put it at risk;</li><li>To ensure that Data transfers always take place subject to appropriate legal safeguards.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> What information should Retail Partners provide to Customers and End-Users? </strong>When a Customer purchases a Product from you it is essential that you provide them with a copy of any Privacy Policy/Notice that we have given to you to pass on; it will explain our responsibilities as a Data Controller to the Customer.</p></p> <p><p>  If you are Collecting and Processing any Personal Data from Customers or End-Users, other than to pass directly to us, you will be a Data Controller of that Personal Data and you should also have a Privacy Policy/Notice. The contents of your Privacy Policy/Notice will vary depending upon where you are based and the requirements of Applicable Privacy Law.</p></p> <p><p>  For example, we expect that any Privacy Policy/Notice would be compliant with Applicable Privacy Laws and should, at a minimum contain the following things:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Your identity and contact details, and, if you have one the details of your Data Protection Officer or head of privacy.</li><li>The purpose for the organization to process an individual’s Personal Data and its legal basis (see below under Where to go for more information).</li><li>Any recipient or categories of recipients of an individual’s Personal Data (this might be us in some cases).</li><li>The details regarding any Data Transfer and the safeguards taken for international transfers.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The retention period or criteria used to determine the retention period of Personal Data.</li><li>The existence of each Individual’s legal rights under Applicable Privacy Law.</li><li>The right to lodge a complaint with you and/or a Privacy Regulator.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> Rights of Customers and End-Users </strong>The rights of Customers and End-Users will vary significantly depending upon which Applicable Privacy Laws you are bound by and you should find out what these are.</p></p> <p><p>  In the EU all Customers and End-Users, whose Personal Data you Collect and Process, will have the following rights, and many other jurisdictions, have similar rights, so we expect our Retail Partners to meet these high standards even if not currently selling in the EU:</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>The right to be informed that you are Processing their Personal Data;</li><li>The right of access to certain information about your Processing and in some cases to a copy of the Personal Data in your possession or control;</li><li>The right to insist that you rectify any inaccurate Personal Data about them in your possession or control;</li><li>The right to request the erasure of out of date or superfluous Personal Data in your possession or control;</li><li>The right to restrict Processing in some circumstances;</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>The right to data portability (to move data to an alternative supplier of a service);</li><li>The right to object to direct marketing (e.g. email, phone, and text marketing); and</li><li>Certain other rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  If they apply to you under Applicable Privacy Laws, you must implement processes for dealing with the right to access, the right to object and the right to erasure.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Security and Legal Safeguards </strong></p><p>  Security Standards and expectations vary across the world but we expect our Retail Partners to meet high standards when it comes to protecting Personal Data and, as a minimum, you must comply with any standards set down by Applicable Privacy Law. This means that:</p><ul>  <li>Access to the personal data is restricted to those on a need-to-know basis.</li><li>Access to Personal Data is monitored and recorded (e.g. by keeping an access log).</li><li>Up to date and adequate technical measures are taken to protect Personal Data including, by example only, password protected systems and equipment, firewall use and virus scanning.</li></ul></div> <p><p>  Robust physical measures are in place to protect Personal Data including, by example only, locked doors, alarms, appropriate security surveillance, enforced ID and access policies.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Data requests from Customers and End-Users </strong>You may receive queries from Customers and End-Users about how you or we use their Personal Data. How you reply will depend upon the Applicable Privacy Law you are bound by. You should always provide a response within at least 30 days. This is required by EU law, and is good practice elsewhere.</p></p> <p><p>  If you receive a query from a Customer or End-User that relates to how we (Snap One) use their Personal Data, you must forward the query to us immediately by email <a href="mailto:legal@control4.com" target="_blank"> legal@snapone.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Managing Data Breach Situations </strong>If you become aware of a Data Breach or suspected Data Breach involving Customer or End-User Personal Data you must inform us immediately so that we can determine whether we need to take steps to safeguard Personal Data and/or take other steps. You can report a Data Breach or suspected Data Breach to us via this email address: <a href="mailto:dpo@control4.com" target="_blank"> dpo@snapone.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  We also recommend that you take immediate independent legal advice and, where necessary, technical advice, to manage the situation. You may need to notify the Customers and End-Users of the situation and may have to make a report to your Privacy Regulator.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Where to go for more information </strong>Your local counsel or Privacy Regulator will be able to provide you with information about your obligations under Applicable Privacy Law.</p></p> <p><p>  Who to contact at Snap OneIf you have any questions about these Guidelines then please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:dpo@control4.com" target="_blank"> dpo@snapone.com </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  All regulatory documentation can be found here: <a href="https://www.control4.com/docs/regulatory" target="_blank"> https://www.control4.com/docs/regulatory </a></p></p> <p><p>  All patent documentation can be found here: <a href="https://www.control4.com/legal/patents" target="_blank"> https://www.control4.com/legal/patents </a></p></p> <p><p>  Snap One is excited to have become a member of the Unified Patents organization.

Note that these Covered Surge Protection Products are still subject to the Company’s Standard Limited Hardware Warranty located at <a href="https://www.snapone.com/legalsnapav.com/shop/en/snapav/snapav-warranty" target="_blank"> https://www.snapone.com/legal </a> (the “Limited Hardware Warranty”) for damage or malfunction of the Covered Surge Protection Products themselves, but we offer additional coverage for damage to products connected to a Covered Surge Protection Product if such Covered Surge Protection Product fails, subject to the terms and conditions outlined in this Policy.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Surge Damage Replacement Policy </strong>Valid only in the United States and Canada. If your Covered Surge Protection Product sacrifices itself while protecting your connected equipment during its Warranty Period, you may request a replacement product, which may be satisfied, at the Company’s discretion, by providing you with a product that is substantially functionally equivalent to the damaged Covered Surge Protection Product. The Warranty Period for your Covered Surge Protection Product can be found on the specific product page on the Company’s website, <a href="https://www.snapav.com/shop/en/snapav/home" target="_blank"> https://www.snapav.com/shop/en/snapav/home </a>. In order to make such a request, you must follow the procedures for obtaining warranty service outlined in Section 3 below [NOTIFICATION].</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> Connected Equipment Replacement Policy </strong>Valid only in the North American, EMEA and APAC regions authorized to sell Company goods. It is the policy of Company that it will, in its sole discretion, replace, pay to replace at fair market value, or pay to repair equipment that is damaged by an AC power, cable, telephone, or lightning surge while connected to a properly installed Covered Surge Protection Product during its Warranty Period. COMPANY’S RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT IS LISTED ON THE COVERED SURGE PROTECTION PRODUCT PAGE ON THE COMPANY’S WEBSITE UNDER THE CONNECTED EQUIPMENT GUARANTEE (<a href="https://www.snapav.com/shop/en/snapav/power" target="_blank"> https://www.snapav.com/shop/en/snapav/power </a>), OR, IF NONE, THEN $25,000. Company must determine that the Covered Surge Protection Product shows signs of surge damage or is performing below its design specifications, relative to its surge protection capability, and under all the circumstances failed to protect the connected equipment.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> THIS POLICY IS SUBJECT TO THE ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS BELOW: </strong>‍</p><p>  1. PROOF OF PURCHASE REQUIRED: This Policy extends to the original purchaser of the Covered Surge Protection Product only and is non-transferable. Original purchase receipts must accompany any product return or claim for connected equipment damage. Covered Surge Protection Products purchased outside of Company’s internet website do not carry valid Connected Equipment Protection Policy protection unless purchased from an Authorized Company Dealer.</p></div> <p><p>  2. PROPER INSTALLATION: Company AC surge protectors must be directly plugged into a properly grounded 3-wire AC outlet. Extension cords, non-grounded two prong adapters, or other non-Covered Surge Protection Products must not be used. Building wiring and other connections to protected equipment must conform to applicable codes for each covered region. No other ground wires or ground connections may be used. All wires (including, e.g., AC power lines, telephone lines, signal/data lines, coaxial cable, etc.) leading into the protected equipment must first pass through a single Covered Surge Protection Product, and may not exceed the number of products or include products not of a type for which the particular Covered Surge Protection Product was designed as specified in the applicable technical specification sheets furnished by Company, available with the Covered Surge Protection Product or on the Company’s websites (“Documentation”). The Covered Surge Protection Product and the equipment to be protected must be indoors in a dry location, and in the same building. Company installation instructions and diagrams must be followed.</p></p> <p><p>  CAUTION: Audio/Video, computer and/or telephone system installations can be very complex systems, which consist of many interconnected components. Due to the nature of electricity and surges, a single protector may not be able to completely protect complex installations. In those cases, a systemic approach using multiple protectors must be employed. Systemic protection requires professional design. AC power, satellite cables, CATV cables, or telephone/network lines entering the system that do not pass through this Covered Surge Protection Product will render this Policy null and void. For additional information on how to protect your system, please contact Company before connecting your equipment to the Covered Surge Protection Product.</p></p> <p><p>  3. NOTIFICATION: You must notify Company within 14 days of any event precipitating a request for product replacement or payment for connected equipment damage. A product incident report (PIR) must be obtained from the Company's Customer Relations Department at <a href="https://www.snapav.com/support" target="_blank"> www.snapav.com/support </a>, completed and returned to the Company within 14 days of the event that you believe damaged your equipment. At the time that you make a PIR with Company, you must notify Company if you believe you have a claim for damaged connected equipment.</p></p> <p><p>  Once you obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (“RMA”) number from the Company, please mark the number on the bottom of the Covered Surge Protection Product and pack it in a shipping carton/box with enough packing material to protect it during transit. The RMA number must also be clearly marked on the outside of the carton. Ship the Covered Surge Protection Product to Company at the address provided. Please note that you are responsible for any and all charges related to shipping the Covered Surge Protection Product.</p></p> <p><p>  If connected equipment damage was indicated on your RMA request, Company will request the make and model of all connected equipment, a connection diagram of your system, as well as other information and documentation based on the extent of the request for product replacement or payment for connected equipment damage. All requests by Company are to be completed and returned within 30 days of the request. Be sure to note its configuration before disconnecting your equipment.</p></p> <p><p>  4. DETERMINATION OF FAILURE: Company will evaluate the Covered Surge Protection Product for surge damage. The Covered Surge Protection Product must show signs of surge damage or must be performing below the product’s specifications relative to its surge protection capability. Opening the enclosure, tampering with, or modifying the Covered Surge Protection Product in any way shall be grounds for an automatic denial of your request for payment. Company, after evaluating all information provided, shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether or not the request is eligible for payment.</p></p> <p><p>  If the Covered Surge Protection Product shows no signs of AC power or signal line surge damage and is working within design specifications, Company will return the Covered Surge Protection Product to you explaining the test results and notifying you of the rejection of your claim. Company reserves the right to inspect the damaged connected equipment, parts, or circuit boards. Please note that you are responsible for any and all charges related to shipping the damaged equipment to Company. Company also reserves the right to inspect the customer’s facility. Damaged equipment deemed uneconomical to repair must remain available for inspection by Company until the claim is finalized.</p></p> <p><p>  5. REQUEST PAYMENTS: Once Company has determined that you are entitled to compensation, Company will, at its sole discretion, pay you the present fair market value of the damaged equipment, pay for the cost of the repair, send you replacement equipment, or pay the equivalence of replacement equipment, up to an aggregate maximum dollar amount that is listed on the Covered Surge Protection Product Page on Company’s website under the Connected Equipment Guarantee (<a href="https://www.snapav.com/shop/en/snapav/power" target="_blank"> https://www.snapav.com/shop/en/snapav/power </a>) or, if none, $25,000.</p></p> <p><p>  6. OTHER INSURANCE/WARRANTIES: The coverage provided pursuant to this Policy is secondary to any existing manufacturer’s warranty, implied or expressed, or any insurance and/or service contract that may cover the loss.</p></p> <p><p>  7. EXCLUSIONS: This Policy does not apply to and does not provide coverage for service charges, installation costs, reinstallation costs; setup costs; diagnostic charges; periodic checkups; routine maintenance; loss of use of the product; costs or expenses arising out of reprogramming or loss of programming and/or data; shipping charges or fees; service calls; loss or damage occasioned by fire, theft, flood, wind, accident, abuse or misuse, and products subject to manufacturer’s recall or similar event. All other limitations of liability and limitations of remedies contained in the Limited Hardware Warranty and not explicitly modified herein continue to apply to these Policy terms.</p></p> <p><p>  DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Will be in accordance with the Legal Procedures outlined in the Limited Hardware Warranty.</p></p> <p><p>  8.

For this reason, tracing the minerals in our supply chain is a complex process. We do not have complete visibility into the sources of all component minerals; however, we have implemented and continue to refine due diligence processes to determine whether the materials provided by our suppliers contain conflict minerals, and we engage with our suppliers to promote responsible sourcing practices and to promote the use of conflict-free minerals in our supply chain.</p></p> <p><p>  To accomplish this goal, Snap One will:‍</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Comply with the conflict minerals reporting rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act.</li><li>Include provisions in our supplier agreements requiring that each supplier comply with all applicable conflict mineral laws. </li><li>Annually request that all suppliers of Snap One products provide to Snap One a report on the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).</li><li>If a supplier is found to be using conflict minerals, Snap One will work to encourage them to find new sources for the minerals and make deliberate progress towards sourcing only conflict-free minerals.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Snap One may determine it is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders to restrict or terminate our business with any company that refuses to provide requested information or help Snap One in its efforts to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  As a leading provider of smart living products, services and software, Snap One will continue to strive to promote the protection of fundamental human rights in the sourcing of raw materials for its products.</p></p> <p><p>  © 2023 Snap One, LLC.
