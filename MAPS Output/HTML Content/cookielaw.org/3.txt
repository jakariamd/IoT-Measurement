</span></div> <div><h1>  Future of EU Cookie Compliance Webinar: GDPR & the E-Privacy Regulation</h1><p>  As reported before Christmas last year on this site, a draft of the proposed new E-Privacy Regulation has been made public. </p><p>  The proposal is for a much stricter regime, requiring prior consent for cookies and any kind of tracking techniques. As with GDPR, fines for failure to comply may reach as high of 4% of a company’s global revenues.</p><p>  Unlike the GDPR, there will only be a 6-month lead-in period from the law being passed, which does not give much time for business and public bodies to react.</p></div> <p><p>  To help organisations meet this challenge, we are hosting a Webinar about the future of EU Cookie Compliance on 19th January, featuring privacy experts from Hogan Lovells, Blackrock and OneTrust. We will discuss the impact of both GDPR and the E-Privacy Directive.  </p></p> <p><p>  Learn more about the Speakers and register <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/6427671688182385667" target="_blank"> here </a>:</p></p> <div><h3>  WordPressAdministrator</h3></div> <div><h2>  Recent Posts</h2></div> <div><h5>  January 13, 2017 </h5><p>  GDPR and now the proposed E-Privacy Regulation mean a stricter regime for cookie compliance, web governance and use of online tracking technologies.
