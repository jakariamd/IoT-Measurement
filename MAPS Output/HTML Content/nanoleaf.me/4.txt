      Ensure transparent communication with data subjects regarding the processing of their
      personal data.

      Ensure data subjects are notified of their rights under the GDPR.
    </td><td>  
        Gorgias' Terms of Service Agreement, Privacy Policy, and supporting policies provide
        a transparent notice to inform its customers.

        In addition, Gorgias offers legal mechanisms for cross-border transfers of
        personal data from the EU.
      </td></div> <td><td>  
        A data controller is exempt from these obligations if it cannot identify which personal
        data in its possession relates to the relevant data subject (i.e., if personal data is
        anonymized and cannot be re-identified).
      </td></td> <div><h2>  Access and Rectification</h2><td>  
      Allow data subjects to require a data controller to rectify any errors in their personal
      data.
    </td><td>  Agents have access to their profiles to amend inaccuracies.</td><td>  Provision of this right to a data subject should not adversely affect an organization’s
        intellectual property (i.e., giving access to a data subject should not require
        disclosure of trade secrets).
      </td></div> <div><h2>  Right to be Forgotten</h2><td>  
      Provide data subjects with the right to delete their personal data if the continued
      processing is not justified.

      For example, you may need to delete your customer’s personal data to comply with your
      GDPR obligations.

      </td><td>  
        A company is not required to delete data, except when one of the following reasons is
        present:
        </td></div> <ul><ul>  <li>The personal data is no longer needed in relation to the purposes for which it
            was collected or otherwise processed.
          </li><li>The data subject withdraws consent, and there are no other legal grounds for
            processing.
          </li><li>The data subject objects to processing, and there are no overriding legitimate
            grounds for processing.
          </li><li>The personal data has been unlawfully processed.</li><li>The personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation.
          </li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>The personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of information
            society services to a minor under 16 years old.
          
</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Restriction Processing</h2><td>  Provide data subjects the right to limit the purposes for which the data controller can
        process personal data.

        For example, your customer has filed a complaint or lawsuit against you, and it is your
        policy to stop processing while the complaint or lawsuit is pending.
      </td><td>  
        The requirement to restrict processing generally applies under the same circumstances as
        the right to be forgotten and/or when the following circumstances exist:
        </td></div> <ul><ul>  <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested (and only for as long as it
            takes
            to verify that accuracy).
          </li><li>The processing is unlawful, and the data subject requests restriction (and the
            data subject is not exercising the right to be forgotten).
          </li><li>The data controller no longer needs the personal data for the original purpose
            but still requires it to establish, exercise, or defend a legal right.
          </li><li>Verification of overriding ground is pending (in the context of a deletion
            request).
          
</li></ul></ul> <div><h2>  Data Portability</h2><td>  
      Provide data subjects with the right to transfer their personal data between data
      controllers.

      For example, your customer requests for you to export and provide them with all
      associated personal data that you store.
    </td><td>  
        Gorgias Helpdesk has an industry standard REST API documented <a href="https://api.gorgias.io/?__hstc=187360119.5aab7e261bd148968070b3ce2a421ca8.1692157463512.1692157463512.1692157463512.1&__hssc=187360119.1.1692157463512&__hsfp=3925178462" target="_blank"> here </a>

        Gorgias Templates for Chrome has an export to CSV functionality that can export your
        data. Member data can be exported via our REST API.
      </td></div> <td><td>  
        Inferred and derived personal data (e.g., a credit score or health assessment) are not
        included because they are not “provided by the data subject.”
        Data controllers are not obligated to retain personal data simply for the purposes of
        providing a copy of the personal data pursuant to a potential data subject request.
      </td></td> <div><h2>  Objection to Processing</h2><td>  Provide data subjects with the right to transfer their personal data between
      controllers.
    </td><td>  Gorgias has documented and implemented internal mechanisms to:
        </td><ul>  <li>Cease processing personal data based upon specific data subject requests,
            confirmed instructions by Gorgias' customer in its capacity of data controller,
            and
            the particular reasoning for objecting to processing.
          </li><li>Cease processing for direct marketing purposes upon request.</li><li>Cease processing of personal data for scientific, historical, or statistical
            purposes.
          
</li></ul></div> <div><td>  
        Data controller must cease processing upon request unless:
        </td><ul>  <li>The data controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for processing
            that
            override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject.
          </li><li>The data controller requires the data in order to establish, exercise, or
            defend
            legal rights.
          </li><li>Processing for scientific, historical, or statistical purposes is carried out
            for
            reasons of public interest.
