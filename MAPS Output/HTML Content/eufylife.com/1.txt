</div></div> <div><h2>  (F) International transfer of Personal Data
</h2><div>  Because of the international nature of our business, we transfer Personal Data within the Anker group, and to third parties as noted in

  
   </div><span>  Section (E) above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we transfer Personal Data to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located, including China, the EEA, the UK, and the US.
</span></div> <div><div>  If an exemption or derogation applies (e.g., where a transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim) we may rely on that exemption or derogation, as appropriate. Where no exemption or derogation applies, and we transfer your Personal Data from the UK or the EEA to recipients located outside the UK or the EEA (as applicable) who are not in Adequate Jurisdictions, we do so on the basis of

  
   </div></div> <div><span>  Standard Contractual Clauses and

  
   </span><span>  International data transfer agreement. You are entitled to request a copy of our [Standard Contractual Clauses] using the contact details provided in

  
   </span><span>  Section (N) below.
</span><div>  Please note that when you transfer any Personal Data directly to any Anker entity established outside the UK or the EEA (as applicable), we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Data. We will nevertheless Process your Personal Data, from the point at which we receive those data, in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.
</div></div> <div><h2>  (G) Data security
</h2><div>  We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, unauthorised access, and other unlawful or unauthorised forms of Processing, in accordance with applicable law.
</div><div>  Because the internet is an open system, the transmission of information

  
   <em> via </em> the internet is not completely secure. Although we will implement all reasonable measures to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to us using the internet – any such transmission is at your own risk and you are responsible for ensuring that any Personal Data that you send to us are sent securely.
</div></div> <div><h2>  (H) Data accuracy
</h2><div>  We take every reasonable step to ensure that:
</div><ul>  <li>your Personal Data that we Process are accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; and

</li></ul><div>  From time to time we may ask you to confirm the accuracy of your Personal Data.
</div></div> <div><h2>  (I) Data minimisation
</h2><div>  We take every reasonable step to ensure that your Personal Data that we Process are limited to the Personal Data reasonably necessary in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy.
</div></div> <div><h2>  (J) Data retention

</td></div> <ul><ul>  <li>in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we continue to Process Personal Data for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.



</li></ul></ul> <div><div>  During the periods noted in paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) above, we will restrict our Processing of your Personal Data to storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim, or any obligation under applicable law.
