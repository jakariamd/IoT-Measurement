This Privacy Policy is part of the terms and conditions set forth in our Terms of Use located at https://cadent.tv/terms-conditions-of-use/. Any defined terms not defined herein shall take their meaning from our Terms of Use, unless otherwise stated in this Website Privacy Policy.
</p></div> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Information Collected through this Website and How We Use It. </strong>
</li><li><strong> Information You Directly and Voluntarily Provide to Us. </strong> If you are a visitor to this Website, we collect information, including any personal information (e.g., name, email address), that you provide to us when you communicate with any of our departments, such as customer service, technical services, or media inquiries, or when filling out the fields on our Contact Us page. This information is used to respond to, and follow up regarding, your inquiries, provide you with requested information, and may be stored into our customer relationship management databases (CRMs) for purposes such as sales and marketing. We may also process your email address and password when logging into our client-facing portal (including any collection of such information via our registration process).

We may also use the email address that has been provided to us (e.g., through a marketing sign-up list on our Website, by providing your email address to a salesperson, through a social media platform, signing up to an online event) to send you information about the products and services that Cadent offers (or may offer in the future).</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li><strong> Information Automatically Collected Through this Website. </strong>
 	We may automatically collect information about you when you use this Website.
</li><li><em> Web logs:  </em>Our web servers keep log files that record data every time a device accesses those servers. As such, when you access this Website, we will automatically collect information such as your browser type and version, device and connection information, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the Internet, and standard web log information. This may be used for security, optimization, or other operational purposes.
</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <em> Cookies and Pixel Tags </em>: We may automatically collect information about you on this Website via “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored within your device’s browser. They are created by pixel tags, which are essentially lines of JavaScript code that will collect information about you in relation to your website visit and also read and write information into the cookie (such as a cookie ID, discussed further below).
</p></p> <p><p>  Upon subsequent visits (either within the same browsing session or across separate browsing sessions), these cookies are read by its corresponding pixel tags so that the same browser can be recognized again, either on our Website or on other websites that have the same pixel tag. Cookies that are stored by us are called “first-party cookies” and cookies that are stored by third parties (via their own pixel tags) are called “third-party cookies.”
</p></p> <p><p>  In general, cookies and pixel tags are used for purposes such as remembering your log-in preferences, counting open rates and connecting URL clickthroughs from emails to our Website, analytics, development of this Website, providing targeted or interest-based advertising, and understanding the effectiveness of advertising campaigns (e.g., ads measurement, attribution, fraud detection, brand safety). Cookies generally do not identify you directly but, rather, have a pseudonymous “cookie ID” associated with it (e.g., a random alphanumeric string of characters). However, we, and our partners, may connect such cookie IDs with other identifiers to assist in advertising, measurement/attribution, or analytics-related purposes.
