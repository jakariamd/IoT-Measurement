Please see our Privacy Policy on how to submit <strong> correction </strong> requests (which cannot be submitted via this form). Each of these rights are described further in our Services Privacy Policy <a href="https://cadent.tv/services-privacy-policy/" target="_blank"> here </a>. We advise that you read the whole policy to understand how our platform works.</p></div> <p><p>  We provide these rights to <strong> U.S. residents only </strong>, as our data is tied to U.S. households. By taking steps to submit a request, you are representing that you are a U.S. resident and that the email address that you submit via the form rightfully belongs to you (e.g., you have not obtained access to the email address through unauthorized or fraudulent means).</p></p> <p><p>  For security reasons, we will first need to validate your control of such email address. Please click “Data Rights Request Form” below and follow the related steps. Where the form is relevant to you as a U.S. resident, we will email you a data rights request form.</p></p> <p><p>  <u> Note </u>: Separate from the above, we may use website cookies/pixels that result in other “sales,” “shares,” and “targeted advertising.” To opt-out of those cookies/pixels, please <a href="#" target="_blank"> click here  </a>.
