            Legal        </p></div> <div><h1>  Standard Terms of Use</h1><span>  In this document</span></div> <div><h2>  
        Thanks for using Mailchimp    </h2><p>  Please read these Standard Terms of Use (“Terms”) carefully. By using the Service (defined below) or signing up for an account, you’re agreeing to these Terms, which will result in a legal agreement between you and The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a Mailchimp (collectively, “Mailchimp,” “we,” or “us”). Mailchimp is part of the Intuit group of companies and our parent entity is Intuit Inc.</p><p>  We’ll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand these Terms. Mailchimp offers an online marketing platform (the “App”) that allows you to manage your contacts, to create, send, and manage certain marketing campaigns, including, without limitation, emails, advertisements, and mailings (each a “Campaign,” and collectively, “Campaigns”), and to create and manage online stores, web pages and websites to reach your people and sell your things (each, a “Site,” and collectively, “Sites”) among other things. The App is part of the platform operated by the Intuit group of companies (the “Intuit Platform”) and is offered through our websites, including <a href="https://www.mailchimp.com" target="_blank"> https://www.mailchimp.com </a>, <a href="https://www.tinyletter.com" target="_blank"> https://www.tinyletter.com </a>, and any other website or mobile application owned, operated or controlled by us (we’ll collectively refer to these as the “Mailchimp Site,” and together with the App ​​and insights, analytics, and other features we make available through our products and services, the “Service”). Mailchimp has employees, officers, directors, independent contractors, and representatives (“our Team”). As a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity that’s a customer of the Service, you’re a “Member” according to this Agreement (or “you”). A “Contact” is any person that you, a Member, may contact through our Service. In other words, a Contact is anyone on a Member's distribution list about whom a Member has given us information or is anyone who has otherwise interacted with a Member via the Service. For example, if you are a Member, a subscriber to your email marketing campaigns or a shopper to your Website or Landing Page would be considered a Contact.</p></div> <p><p>  These Terms, including our <a href="/legal/acceptable_use/" target="_blank"> Acceptable Use Policy </a>, <a href="/legal/api_use/" target="_blank"> API Use Policy </a>, <a href="/legal/copyright/" target="_blank"> Copyright and Trademark Policy </a>, <a href="/legal/data-processing-addendum/" target="_blank"> Data Processing Addendum </a>, and <a href="/about/brand-assets/" target="_blank"> Brand Guidelines </a> (collectively, the “Agreement”) define the terms and conditions under which you’re allowed to use the Service in accordance with the Agreement, which in addition to our <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/" target="_blank"> Global Privacy Statement </a> and <a href="/legal/cookies/" target="_blank"> Cookie Statement </a>, describe how we’ll treat your account and the data we collect and process about you, your end users, and your contacts and customers while you’re a Member. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you must immediately discontinue your use of the Service.</p></p> <p><p>  Additional terms and restrictions available on our Mailchimp Site at mailchimp.com/legal/additional-terms (“Additional Terms”) apply to some features of the Service, including some which are offered as add-ons to your Mailchimp account (“Add-ons”). Unless expressly stated otherwise, these Terms apply to the use of Add-ons. Members agree to the applicable Additional Terms at the time they choose to add the corresponding Add-on or use the corresponding feature. Also note that a Member’s account may have access to unique features of the Service based on their historic usage or status.</p></p> <p><p>  Mailchimp uses Google Maps and YouTube to provide certain features of the Service, and, as a result, we are contractually obligated to make our Members aware of certain terms related to the use of such features. Therefore, you acknowledge and agree that by signing up for an account and using the Service, you are also bound by the <a href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html" target="_blank"> Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service </a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank"> YouTube Terms of Service </a> (including the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&gl=us" target="_blank"> Google Privacy Policy </a>).</p></p> <p><p>  If you download the App through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other app store or distribution platform (“App Provider”), you acknowledge and agree that: (i) these Terms are between us, and not with the App Provider, and that we are responsible for the Service, not the App Provider; (ii) the App Provider has no obligation to furnish maintenance and support services or handle any warranty claims; (iii) the App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party have relating to the App; and (iv) the App Provider is a third party beneficiary of these Terms as related to your use of the App, and the App Provider will have the right to enforce these Terms as related to your use of the App against you.</p></p> <div><h2>  
        I. Account    </h2><p>  <strong> 1. Eligibility </strong></p><p>  In order to use the Service, you must:</p><p>  <strong> 1. </strong> be at least eighteen (18) years old and able to enter into contracts;</p><p>  <strong> 2. </strong> complete the account registration process;</p><p>  <strong> 3. </strong> agree to these Terms and the other terms and conditions linked in these Terms that form part of the Agreement;</p><p>  <strong> 4. </strong> provide true, complete, and up-to-date contact and billing information;</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> 5. </strong> not be based in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea, Donetsk ("DNR"), and Luhansk ("LNR") regions of Ukraine or any other territory that is subject to a government embargo;</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6. </strong> and not be included in lists maintained by the United States or other applicable jurisdictions prohibiting transactions with and the export of US products to certain entities, people and jurisdictions.</p></p> <p><p>  By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won’t use the Service in a way that violates any laws or regulations. Note that by representing and warranting, you are making a legally enforceable promise.</p></p> <p><p>  Mailchimp may refuse service, close accounts of any Members, and change eligibility requirements at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2. Term </strong></p></p> <p><p>  When you sign up for an account and agree to these Terms, the Agreement between you and Mailchimp is formed, and the term of the Agreement (the “Term”) will begin. The Term will continue for as long as you have a Mailchimp account or until you or we terminate the Agreement in accordance with these Terms, whichever happens first. If you sign up for an account on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms and enter into the Agreement on its behalf.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 3. Closing Your Account </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You or Mailchimp may terminate the Agreement at any time and for any reason. You may do so by terminating your Mailchimp account or we may do so by giving notice to you that we are terminating the Agreement.  We may suspend the Service to you at any time, with or without cause. We won’t refund or reimburse you in any situation. If your account is inactive for 24 or more months, we may terminate your account and you won’t be entitled to a refund for any prepaid amounts or reimbursement for unused Pay as You Go Credits. Once your account is terminated, you acknowledge and agree that we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with it, including your Campaigns. Usernames are unique and can only be used once. If your account has been terminated, the username will no longer be available for use on any future accounts and cannot be reclaimed.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4. Changes </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms on our Mailchimp Site. Unless you terminate your account, the new Terms will be effective immediately upon posting on the effective date indicated in the new Terms, as applicable, and apply to any continued or new use of the Service. We may change the Service, Add-ons, or any features of the Service at any time, and we may discontinue the Service, Add-ons, or any features of the Service at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5. Account and Password </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You’re responsible for keeping your account name and password confidential. You’re also responsible for any account that you have access to and any activity occurring in such account (other than activity that Mailchimp is directly responsible for that isn’t performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity. You’ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized access or use of your accounts. We’re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords. We don’t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only provide you with instructions on how to reset your password. We have the right to update any of your contact information in your account for billing purposes. In addition, you represent and warrant that all information you provide to us when you establish an account, and when you access and use the Service, is and will remain complete and accurate. We may contact you, or any seat, authorized user, or login added to your account, based on the information provided in your account.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6. Account Disputes </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We don’t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of your personal relationships. You won’t request access to or information about an account that’s not yours, and you’ll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party. We decide who owns an account based on a number of factors, including the content in that account, and the contact and profile information listed for that account. In cases where differing contact and profile information is present or we are unable to reasonably determine ownership, we’ll require you to resolve the matter through proper channels outside of Mailchimp.</p></p> <p><p>  When a dispute is identified, we may suspend any account associated with the dispute, including disabling login and sending capabilities, to protect the security and privacy of the data held within the account until the dispute is properly resolved.</p></p> <div><h2>  
        II. Payment    </h2><p>  <strong> 7. Marketing Platform: Monthly Marketing Plans and Pay as You Go Credits </strong></p><p>  If you had a paid monthly plan on or before May 15, 2019, the following Section 7 may not apply to you and your account. If it does not apply, an alternate version of Section 7 applicable to you and your account is available in your account (navigate to “Account,” then “Billing,” then “Monthly plans or credits”).</p><p>  <strong> 7A. Paid Marketing Plans </strong></p></div> <p><p>  If you sign up for a paid monthly marketing plan, you will be required to self-select both your projected audience, as described in Section 7B below, and your package (e.g., Essentials, Standard, Premium) (together, your “Paid Marketing Plan”) from the options <a href="/pricing/marketing/" target="_blank"> posted </a> on our Mailchimp Site based on your anticipated use of the Service. Each Paid Marketing Plan offers different pricing and feature options and has varying usage limits. 
Once you select your Paid Marketing Plan, Mailchimp will never automatically upgrade or downgrade your Paid Marketing Plan. So, give yourself room to grow if you’ll need it! If you exceed your Paid Marketing Plan usage limits (either by exceeding your audience or monthly email limits, or both), you will incur additional charges for the prior billing cycle based on your current Paid Marketing Plan, which will be detailed on your bill and in your account. Before paying for your Paid Marketing Plan for the first time, you will have an opportunity to preview the additional charges which would apply to your Paid Marketing Plan should you incur them by exceeding your self-selected usage limits. If you decide to proceed, and you incur additional charges, you agree to pay them on or before the next Pay Date, as described below. You will always have the option to upgrade to a higher tier at any time. If you upgrade during a billing cycle, you may elect to upgrade your package, your audience limit, or both. If you elect to upgrade both, the upgrade amount for the package upgrade is calculated first, and the upgrade amount for the audience limit upgrade is calculated second. In any event, your monthly charge for that billing cycle will be calculated based on the number of days in that billing cycle during which you were at each of the lower tier and the higher tier (including any applicable additional charges for the higher tier). You will also have the option to downgrade to a lower tier at any time, but if you elect to downgrade during a billing cycle, your downgrade will not be effective until the end of that billing cycle, and you will still be charged for that entire billing cycle at the higher tier (including any applicable additional charges for the higher tier).</p></p> <p><p>  When you sign up for a Paid Marketing Plan, you agree to monthly recurring billing, starting on the date you sign up. Billing occurs on the same day each month, based on the date that you first started paying for any recurring monthly plan. Payments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day you made your first monthly payment (the “Pay Date”). If any part of a month is included in the Term, then payment is required for the full month. If you exceed your self-selected usage limits for your Paid Marketing Plan, then you’ll have to pay additional charges (as described above) for the prior billing cycle on or before the next Pay Date, even if the Term ends or you downgrade to a Free Marketing Plan before that payment is otherwise due. Billing for Paid Marketing Plans may be paused, and you may choose to close your account permanently at any time.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7B. Audience and Archiving </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You may have several types of contacts in your Mailchimp account, but only contacts that you can engage through the Service count as contacts in your “audience” for purposes of your Paid Marketing Plan or Free Marketing Plan. Subscribed, unsubscribed, and non-subscribed contacts count towards your audience. Cleaned, reconfirmed, and archived contacts do not count towards your audience, nor do contacts whose opt-in confirmation is pending. You may elect to archive contacts at any time, but any profile changes for an archived contact (whether initiated by you, the contact, or an integration) will automatically unarchive that contact. You cannot engage in any activity through the Service with archived contacts unless and until they are unarchived. If a contact is unarchived, it will immediately count towards your audience for your current billing cycle and any future billing cycles unless and until archived again.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7C. Free Marketing Plans </strong></p></p> <p><p>  All Members, including those who sign up for a Commerce Plan, have access to basic marketing functionality under the free marketing plan (“Free Marketing Plan”). If you use the Service under the Free Marketing Plan and you want to go over the Free Marketing Plan limits, you’ll be required to select and pay for a Paid Marketing Plan. Paid Marketing Plans are described in Section 7A above. If you exceed your Free Marketing Plan limits, or otherwise upgrade your account to a paid Paid Marketing Plan, you’ll only be provided one complimentary downgrade to the Free Marketing Plan (provided your sending volume, audience numbers, and other feature usage drops down to the Free Marketing Plan usage limits in effect at the time of downgrade). If you go over the limits for the Free Marketing Plan more than once, you’ll no longer qualify for the Free Marketing Plan, even if your future sending volume and audience numbers are within the limits of the Free Marketing Plan.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7D. Pay as You Go Credits </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You may also buy email credits to use the Service (“Pay as You Go Credits”), as explained on our Mailchimp Site. You will have an opportunity to review current rates for Pay as You Go Credits in your account prior to purchase. If you choose to buy Pay as You Go Credits, you’ll have access to the features of the Service included in the Essentials Marketing package, as described on the <a href="/pricing/marketing/" target="_blank"> pricing page </a>, and other than the monthly payment requirement, all of these Terms will still apply to you. Pay as You Go Credits purchased on or after May 15, 2019 roll over each month, and expire 12 months after purchase. Pay as You Go Credits purchased before May 15, 2019 also roll over each month, and expired on May 15, 2020. Pay as You Go Credits have no cash value, cannot be refunded or redeemed for cash, and represent a limited license to use the Service for the specified volume and type of service.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7E. 1 Month Promotional Free Trial Membership </strong></p></p> <p><p>  From time to time at our discretion, we may offer a promotional, free trial period of 1 month for a Paid Marketing Plan (“Trial Period”).  To activate the Trial Period, you will be required to (1) enroll for the eligible Paid Marketing Plan of your choice, and (2) provide valid payment information to us at the time of enrollment.

Prior to the expiration of the Trial Period, we will notify you of the upcoming expiration of your Trial Period.  If the payment method we have on file for you is declined, you must provide to us a new, valid payment method for the Paid Marketing Plan or we reserve the right, without further notice, to immediately suspend or cancel your continued use of the Paid Marketing Plan. </p></p> <p><p>  To be eligible for the Trial Period, you must be a new Mailchimp customer and sign up for a Paid Marketing Plan using the “Free for 1 Month” option (or other like wording).  The 1 Month  Promotional Free Trial Membership offer cannot be combined with any other Mailchimp offer(s) and is available for a limited time.  Offer is provided through a 100% discount to your recurring monthly Mailchimp plan charges for the first monthly bill immediately following fulfilling the eligibility criteria.

You can downgrade your Paid Marketing Plan in the Monthly Plans or Credits page in the Billing Section. Downgrading your Paid Marketing Plan will become effective at the end of the monthly billing period. You will not receive a refund for previously billed charges.

Downgrading your monthly plan will become effective at the end of the monthly billing period. You will not receive a refund for previously billed charges. You will immediately lose the offer if you cancel your account during or prior to the end of the promotional period. Pausing your account does not pause the promotional period and the promotion will expire 12 months from when it was originally applied to your account. Changing your Marketing plan does not extend the duration of the promotional period and the promotion will expire 12 months from when it was originally applied to your account. These offer terms do not replace Mailchimp’s standard <a href="/legal/terms/" target="_blank"> Terms of Use </a> and <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/" target="_blank"> Global Privacy Statement </a>, which continue to apply to your use of Mailchimp. All personal information will be handled in accordance with Mailchimp’s <a href="https://www.intuit.com/privacy/statement/" target="_blank"> Global Privacy Statement </a>.

Commerce Platform: Monthly Commerce Plans, Stores, Websites and Domains </strong></p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 8A. Monthly Commerce Plans </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You also have the option to select a monthly Websites & Commerce plan (“Commerce Plan”) from those <a href="/pricing/commerce/" target="_blank"> posted </a> on our Mailchimp Site. With a Commerce Plan, you will have access to Stores, Websites, Domains, Appointment Scheduling, and related commerce features. All Members, including those who sign up for a Free Marketing Plan, have access to basic commerce functionality under the Free Commerce Plan. If you sign up for a Core or Plus Commerce Plan (such Commerce Plan, a “Paid Commerce Plan”), you agree to monthly recurring billing in advance, starting on the date you sign up for a Paid Commerce Plan. Thereafter, billing occurs on the same day each month, based on the date that you first started paying for any recurring monthly plan (e.g., Paid Commerce Plan, Paid Marketing Plan). Note that your first payment for your Paid Commerce Plan may be prorated if you first started paying for any other recurring monthly plan before you signed up for your Paid Commerce Plan; thereafter, your payment dates will align, and you will be billed for the full billing cycle each month.</p></p> <p><p>  If you wish to cancel your Paid Commerce Plan, you may do so within your Mailchimp account, and cancellation will be effective on the last date of the current billing cycle for which you have paid. You agree to make all payments owed for your Commerce Plan in accordance with these Terms.
If you had a free or paid monthly plan on or before May 15, 2019 and still have that plan, you do not have access to Paid Commerce Plans at this time.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 8B. Stores </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you create and publish a Store, you are also subject to Additional Terms found <a href="/legal/additional-terms/#For_Stores" target="_blank"> here </a>. Irrespective of the Commerce Plan that you select, if you create and publish a Store, you will be required to pay processing and other fees to Stripe for any transactions conducted through your Store. Those fees will be described in your contract with Stripe. You will also be required to pay transaction fees to Mailchimp, the amount of which depends on your Commerce Plan and Store order volume. Transaction fees for each Commerce Plan are disclosed <a href="/pricing/commerce/compare-plans/" target="_blank"> here </a>. Transaction fees will be a percentage of total order value (i.e., total merchandise value, minus any promotions and discounts, plus all shipping and handling fees and applicable taxes), and will be calculated and automatically deducted from total order value (and retained by Mailchimp) on a per order basis. Your customers will not see these transaction fees during their checkout process. Transaction fees will not be returned or refunded by Mailchimp to you or your customer under any circumstance, including in the event your customer returns or exchanges a product or in the event of a fraudulent transaction; however, in many instances, a fraudulent transaction will be detected and terminated by Stripe prior to completion, meaning no processing or transaction fees would have been charged for that transaction. Please refer to your contract with Stripe for information on Stripe’s processing and other fees.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 8C. Websites and Domains </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Mailchimp-branded domains (e.g., yourcompany’sname.mailchimpsites.com) are offered to Members free of charge. Members may also purchase custom domains (e.g., yourcompany’sname.com) at the prices set forth <a href="/help/about-domain-purchasing/#Available_domains" target="_blank"> here </a>. Members are billed for custom domains on the date of purchase and then billed annually for the renewal of the custom domain prior to the custom domain’s expiration. To provide uninterrupted service, we will automatically charge for and renew a Member’s custom domain unless the Member opts out of automatic renewal in the app or by contacting customer support. By purchasing a custom domain, you are subject to the Additional Terms found <a href="/legal/additional-terms/#For_Domains" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  Websites for Mailchimp-branded domains are offered free of charge. To build a Website on a custom domain or a domain you connect to Mailchimp, you must purchase a Paid Commerce Plan. If you build a Website with Mailchimp, you are also subject to the Additional Terms found <a href="/legal/additional-terms/#For_Websites" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 9. Dedicated IP Addresses </strong></p></p> <p><p>  In certain circumstances, Members may have the option to purchase access to a dedicated IP address or specifically designated shared IP address (collectively, a “Dedicated IP Address”) for email sending purposes. Mailchimp, in its sole discretion, may determine whether to provision access to a Dedicated IP Address. Dedicated IP Addresses used to provide the Service are owned and operated by Mailchimp and we reserve the right to revoke a Member’s use of a Dedicated IP Address at any time. If your account uses a Dedicated IP Address and email sending for the account is paused or suspended for 30 days or more for any reason (including but not limited to compliance matters, failed or overdue payment issues, or voluntarily pausing your Monthly Plan), Mailchimp may reclaim the Dedicated IP Address from the account and terminate any future use of the Dedicated IP Address by the Member.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 10. Debit and Credit Cards </strong></p></p> <p><p>  As long as you’re a Member with a Paid Marketing Plan, a Paid Commerce Plan, or a Transactional Email Plan (each, a “Monthly Plan”) or are otherwise utilizing paid features of the Service or have an outstanding balance with us, you’ll provide us with valid debit or credit card (“card”) information and authorize us to deduct your charges against that card. You’ll replace the information for any card that expires with information for a valid one. If your card is automatically replaced with a new card by a payment processor, you acknowledge and agree that we’re authorized to deduct any charges on your account against the new card. Anyone using a card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that card and won’t be rejected. If we’re unable to process your card order for any reason, we’ll try to contact you by email and may suspend your account until your payment can be processed.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 11. Refunds </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You won’t be entitled to a refund or credit from us under any circumstance. However, we may, at our sole discretion, offer a refund, discount or credit. </p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 12. Charges for Add-Ons </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you use an Add-on that has a charge, then you’ll be billed that additional amount with each billing cycle for as long as the Add-on is active. Your billing cycle for an Add-on may differ from your billing cycle for your Monthly Plan or other features of the Service, and certain Add-ons may require upfront payment for their entire billing cycle. If you use Transactional Email to send bulk emails in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, then we may charge you at the comparable Paid Marketing Plan rate or terminate your account.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 13. Billing Changes and Taxes </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We may change any of our fees, including our charges for Monthly Plans and Pay as You Go Credits, at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our Mailchimp Site or in your account and/or sending you a notification by email. Quoted fees don’t include sales or other transaction-based taxes of any kind.</p></p> <p><p>  “Tax” or “Taxes” means all applicable taxes, including but not limited to indirect taxes such as goods and services tax (“GST”), value added tax (“VAT”), sales tax, fees, duties, levies, or other similar taxes. Unless otherwise stated, any consideration, amount payable, prices, fees, payment terms and/or any other amounts are exclusive of Taxes. In the event that any amount payable by you to Mailchimp is subject to Taxes, Mailchimp shall collect the full amount of those Taxes from you and said collection shall not reduce or somehow impact the amount to which Mailchimp is entitled. You will reimburse and indemnify Mailchimp for any Taxes, interest, and penalties that Mailchimp may be compelled to pay on account of your non-payment. You must pay any applicable Taxes.  In the event that any payments and/or amount payable by you to Mailchimp is subject to (i) any withholding or similar tax; (ii) any Taxes not collected by Mailchimp; or (iii) any other Taxes or other government levy of whatever nature, the full amount of that tax or levy shall be solely your responsibility and shall not reduce the amount to which Mailchimp is entitled under the Agreement. You will indemnify and hold Mailchimp harmless against any and all claims by any competent tax authority related to any such withholding or similar taxes and any penalties and/or interest thereon.</p></p> <div><h2>

Assignments </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You may not assign any of your rights under the Agreement to anyone else. We may assign the Agreement and any of our rights and obligations hereunder to any other individual or entity at our discretion.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 30. Choice of Law </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The State of Georgia laws and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to the Service and the Agreement, regardless of conflict of laws rules.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 31. Dispute Resolution </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If you are a U.S. customer:</p></p> <p><p>  You and Mailchimp agree that, except as provided below, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Service or this Agreement (a “Claim”) will be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</p></p> <p><p>  Either you or Mailchimp can seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied. Either you or Mailchimp may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court in your county of residence or the small claims court in closest proximity to your residence, and you may also bring a claim in small claims court of Fulton County, Georgia. </p></p> <p><p>  Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and Mailchimp are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of the Agreement and/or the termination of your Service.</p></p> <p><p>  If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Mailchimp a written Notice of your Claim (“Notice of Claim”). The Notice of Claim to Mailchimp should be sent in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like Mailchimp to use to contact you. If Mailchimp elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your address on file. A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by Mailchimp, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought.</p></p> <p><p>  You and Mailchimp agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Mailchimp therefore agree that, after a Notice of Claim is sent but before either you or Mailchimp commence arbitration or file a claim in small claims court against the other, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Claim covered by the Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. Likewise, if Mailchimp is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the conference as well, but Mailchimp agrees to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</p></p> <p><p>  If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or Mailchimp may commence an arbitration proceeding by filing a Demand for Arbitration or, alternatively, by filing a Claim in small claims court. You agree that you may not commence any arbitration or file a claim in small claims court unless you and Mailchimp are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your completed Notice of Claim and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with Mailchimp during that time. If a Claim qualifies for small claims court, but a party commences an arbitration proceeding, you and Mailchimp agree that either party may elect instead to have the Claim resolved in small claims court, and upon written notice of a party’s election, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administratively close the arbitration proceeding. Any dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In the event of any such dispute, the arbitration proceeding shall remain closed unless and until a decision by the small claims court that the Claim should proceed in arbitration. You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank"> www.adr.org </a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" target="_blank"> www.adr.org </a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879, except as modified by these Term. Unless Mailchimp and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.</p></p> <p><p>  The arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the State of Georgia or the state of your residence and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s National Roster of arbitrators. The arbitrator will be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates meeting this criteria; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference; (c) the AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. Except as otherwise provided below, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.</p></p> <p><p>  You and Mailchimp agree that an administrative conference with the AAA shall be conducted in each arbitration proceeding, and you and a Mailchimp company representative shall appear at the administrative conference via telephone. If you fail to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of whether your counsel attends, the AAA will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless you show good cause as to why you were not able to attend the conference.</p></p> <p><p>  The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. Mailchimp will not seek to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration from you unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Judgment on any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall not preclude any party to the arbitration from at any time seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction including whether a Demand for Arbitration is filed in violation of these Terms.</p></p> <p><p>  Unless you or Mailchimp seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you or Mailchimp and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the extent that you or Mailchimp prevail on a Claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration. Before a court of competent jurisdiction issues any public injunctive relief, it shall review the factual findings of the arbitration award on which any injunction would issue with no deference to the arbitrator.</p></p> <p><p>  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. You are required to pay AAA’s initial filing fee, but Mailchimp will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the arbitration to the extent it exceeds the fee for filing a complaint in a federal or state court in your county of residence or in Fulton County, Georgia. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and Mailchimp will not reimburse your initial filing fee. You and Mailchimp agree that the AAA has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under the AAA Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the AAA fees to you or Mailchimp, and you and Mailchimp waive any objection to such fee modification.</p></p> <p><p>  You and Mailchimp agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, if you have elected arbitration, unless both you and Mailchimp agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate any other person's Claims with your Claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If Mailchimp believes that any Claim you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with the limitations in this paragraph, then you agree that Mailchimp may seek an order from a court determining whether your Claim is within the scope of the Class Action Waiver. If this Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution Section shall be null and void.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 32. Force Majeure </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We won’t be held liable for any delays or failure in performance of any part of the Service, from any cause beyond our control. This includes, but is not limited to, acts of god, changes to law or regulations, embargoes, war, terrorist acts, riots, fires, earthquakes, nuclear accidents, floods, strikes, power blackouts, volcanic action, unusually severe weather conditions, and acts of hackers or third-party internet service providers.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 33. Survivability </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Even if the Agreement is terminated, the following sections will continue to apply: Feedback and Proprietary Rights, Compliance with Laws, Limitation of Liability, No Warranties, Indemnity, Dispute Resolution, Choice of Law, Severability, and Entire Agreement.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 34. Severability </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If it turns out that a section of these Terms isn’t enforceable, then that section will be removed or edited as little as required, and the rest of the Agreement will still be valid.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 35. Interpretation </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The headers and sidebar text are provided only to make these Terms easier to read and understand. The fact that we wrote these Terms won’t affect the way the Agreement is interpreted.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 36. Waiver </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If we don’t immediately take action on a violation of these Terms, we’re not giving up any rights under the Terms, and we may still take action at some point.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 37. No Changes in Terms at Request of Member </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Because we have so many Members, we can’t change these Terms for any one Member or group.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 38. Further Actions </strong></p></p> <p><p>  You’ll provide all documents and take any actions necessary to meet your obligations under these Terms.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 39. Notification of Security Incident </strong></p></p> <p><p>  If we become aware of a security incident related to our systems or databases that contain personal information of you or your contacts, we’ll notify you if required by law. In that event, we’ll also provide you with information about that incident so that you can evaluate the consequences to you and any legal or regulatory requirements that may apply to you, unless we’re prevented from doing so by legal, security or confidentiality obligations. Notifying you of a security incident or cooperating with you to respond to one will not be deemed an acknowledgement or assumption of any liability or fault of Mailchimp for such incident.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 40. Beta Services </strong></p></p> <p><p>  From time to time, (i) we may invite you to try products or features related to our Service that are not generally available to all of our Members or the public or (ii) we may release products or features related to our Service that are identified in the App as beta, preview, pilot, limited release, or by a similar designation (collectively, “Beta Services”). Beta Services may be provided for evaluation or testing purposes only, and, therefore, may contain bugs or errors, and may not be as reliable as other features of the Service. The Beta Services are provided as-is. Your use of such features may include additional rules or restrictions that we may place on their use. We may discontinue Beta Services at any time in our sole discretion, and we may decide not to make Beta Services generally available. For the avoidance of doubt, Beta Services are a part of the Service, and, therefore, are subject to the terms of the Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 22 and 23.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 41. Notices </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Any notice to you will be effective when we send it to the last email or physical address you gave us or when posted on our Mailchimp Site. Please note that, for purposes of providing notice, we may use any email or physical address within your account, including contact information associated with an account’s primary contact, billing contact, owner profile, or any other profile or seat associated with the account. Any notice to us will be effective when delivered to us along with a copy to our legal counsel: Attn. Legal Department, Mailchimp, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, Georgia, 30308, or any addresses as we may later post on the Mailchimp Site.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 42. Entire Agreement </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The Agreement, including these Terms and any Additional Terms you’ve agreed to by enabling any Add-ons, make up the entire agreement between us in relation to its subject matter and supersede all prior agreements, representations, and understandings. Any Additional Terms will be considered incorporated into the Agreement when you activate or use the corresponding Add-on or feature of the Service.</p></p> <p><p>  Where there’s a conflict between these Terms and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control to the extent of the conflict.</p></p> <p><p>  Congratulations! You’ve reached the end.</p></p> <p><p>  Updated August 1st, 2023 and effective as of August 1, 2023.</p></p> <div><ul>  <li>Related Links:
