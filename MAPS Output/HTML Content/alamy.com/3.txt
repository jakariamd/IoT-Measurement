The costs of the inspection will be paid by you except if it reveals an underpayment to you of more than US $1000 in any one twelve (12) month period, in which event Alamy will correct the records relating to your Content, make any payments due as identified by such audit and reimburse the actual costs of your audit.

In either event, Alamy, in its sole discretion, may either take action itself against the third party or may notify you that it will not be taking action and you may then do so at your option.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Where Alamy has a reasonable belief that the Content on a third-party website has been sourced from Alamy without a Licence, including but not limited to watermarked images or credit lines, you grant Alamy the right to pursue any suspected or actual infringements of copyright of the Content without the need to notify you.</li><li>If you take action pursuant to clause 16.7, then Alamy's sole obligation will be to (at your request and cost) verify the terms of this Contract or any Customer contract. Prior to providing such assistance, Alamy may require you to indemnify Alamy for all of the costs and expenses incurred by Alamy in relation to such action including, at Alamy's discretion, providing and securing the costs of Alamy's legal and other advisers.
