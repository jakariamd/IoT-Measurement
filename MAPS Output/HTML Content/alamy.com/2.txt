                                                </li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>when used in a news or editorial context, you may only crop or otherwise edit the Content for technical quality purposes, provided that the editorial integrity of the Content is not compromised, and the truth of the Content is maintained. The Content when used in a news or editorial context may not, under any circumstances, be otherwise altered;</li><li>Content depicting in copyright artwork may be cropped or otherwise edited for technical quality purposes only, provided that the original context and setting of the Content is not altered; and</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>subject to Clauses 3.2.1.1 and 3.2.1.2, you may alter, crop, manipulate and create derivative works from the Content;
</li><li>you must not incorporate any Content (or any part of it) into a logo, trademark or service mark;</li><li>Content must not be used as references for creating drawings or other visual works unless specifically authorised in the Invoice;</li><li>the Content Information (as defined in Clause 5.3) and any caption or keyword associated with the Content is provided “as is” and Alamy does not warrant the accuracy of such information. In particular you acknowledge that the Content Information may have been translated from its original language using an automated machine translation process that Alamy has had no input into or control over and that accordingly Alamy disclaims any liability for inaccurate, misleading, defamatory, insulting, offensive, infringing or unlawful Content created as a result of or arising out of such translation process;</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>you acknowledge that the Content licensed to you may be original Content that has had certain pre-formatting changes carried out by Alamy, as may be specified on the applicable Invoice.

Any such Claims existing at the time the Content is purported to be Licenced will render any Licence granted void from the beginning.
