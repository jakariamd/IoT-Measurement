This privacy statement applies regardless of your or any end user's geographical location and covers all of our websites, (sub)domains, mobile applications, desktop clients, as well as the services we provide.Personal data refers to information that would allow any natural person to be directly or indirectly identified. Your use of our website or services may involve personal data relating to three categories of individuals:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Personal data related to a <strong> customer or potential customer </strong>, referred to as “<strong> Customer Account Data </strong>” or ‘potential customer information’.</li><li>Personal data related to an <strong> end user or recipient </strong>, meaning the individual that is interacting with you via our services and/or receiving communications from you via our services, referred to as ‘end user data’ (collectively, “<strong> End User </strong>”).</li><li>Personal data related to <strong> website visitors </strong>, referred to as ‘website visitor data’.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  Data privacy and protection of your personal data (including personal data relating to your End Users) is one of MessageBird’s core principles. Our privacy statement is intended to give you a detailed understanding of our data processing practices. It is important to us that we are transparent, and you feel informed and empowered when it comes to the privacy of your and your End Users’ personal data, and the steps we take to protect that personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  If you or any of your End Users are located in Singapore, references in this privacy statement to terms such as "data subject", "data controller", and "data processor" should be taken to refer to the equivalent terms of "individual", "organization", and "data intermediary" under the Personal Data Protection Act of 2012 (“<strong> PDPA </strong>”).</p></p> <p><p>  If you or any of your End Users reside in California, references in this privacy statement to terms such as “personal data”, "data subject", "data controller", and "data processor" should be taken to refer to the equivalent terms of “personal information”, "consumer", "business", and "service provider" under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong> CCPA </strong>”). MessageBird does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal data or the personal data of End Users for money or anything else of value.</p></p> <p><p>  MessageBird applies the same data protection standards to all individuals regardless of nationality, geographic location, or data source. Personal information is only used when necessary to achieve a purpose, the persons whose data it concerns are properly informed, and there are legal grounds to do so. All activities involving personal data will be checked against the EU’s GDPR or other applicable laws.</p></p> <p><p>  1. <strong> About our personal data processing practices </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We will only process personal data to the extent necessary to fulfill the specific purpose(s) for which you have submitted personal data. When you sign up to our services through our website, we request you to provide contact information details such as your name and email address. We subsequently use that information to create your account, facilitate your use of the services, billing purposes, and to provide you with relevant information about our services. Some basic examples of actions that result in us processing your personal data are (a) when you sign up to our newsletter, (b) you sign up for the services via our website and accept the <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/legal/terms-and-conditions" target="_blank"> General Terms and Conditions </a> (the “<strong> Terms </strong>”), or (c) sign up for the services through an order form. To the extent permitted or required by applicable law, you will be given the opportunity to explicitly agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and sharing of the personal data you’ve provided. We do not use your personal data for any other purposes than those agreed to by you or as permitted by the Terms and this privacy statement.</p></p> <p><p>  When you share personal data with us, we commit to handle that information in accordance with the applicable data protection and e-privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong> GDPR </strong>”). Due to the nature of the services we do not interact with End Users directly. You are responsible for ensuring that you have all applicable rights and consents to share any End User personal data with us and that the personal data is accurate and complete.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 1.1 Roles and responsibilities.  </strong>When it comes to processing personal data, there are several different roles and responsibilities that come into play. This privacy statement provides an explanation of the relevant roles, the corresponding responsibilities of each role, and the systems of governance that play an integral part in protecting your personal data.The <em> data controller </em> determines the purpose (<em> why </em>) and means (<em> how </em>) of personal data processing and remains ultimately responsible for the correct handling of the data subject’s personal data. In practice, the data controller is often the company that an individual (or data subject) provides their personal data to directly.</p></p> <p><p>  The <em> data processor </em> is a company that provides services to the data controller, and receives personal data from or on behalf of the data controller in order to perform those services. To give an example, when one of our customers sends a marketing campaign through our communications platform, we receive personal data from the customer, such as a phone number or email address of the intended recipient, in order to provide the service. In this example MessageBird acts as the data processor of the customer, who in turn is acting as the data controller of the phone number or email address entrusted to it by the individual to which this personal data belongs. The data processor only processes personal data according to the instructions of the data controller. These instructions are typically laid down in a data processing agreement between the controller and the processor.</p></p> <p><p>  Depending on your relationship with us, we can be either data controller or data processor, or in certain circumstances we can be both. If you have any questions about these practices or more general inquiries about how we handle personal data, you can contact us at privacy[at]messagebird.com.</p></p> <p><p>  Personal data is collected for specific purposes, including the prevention of spam and fraud, the fulfillment of legal requirements, communication, marketing, sales activities, and ancillary services. Personal information will never be collected, used, or retained without purpose. We do not sell your or your end-users personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2. Why we collect personal data </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We have a few key priorities when it comes to protecting your personal data. Not only do we prioritize keeping your personal data safe and secure, we are also highly focused on protecting your privacy rights and freedoms as an individual.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 2.1 Legal bases </strong>.All personal data we process is lawfully obtained and will only be processed to the extent we have a legal basis to do so. The legal bases we rely upon for processing of personal data are: (a) consent, (b) performance of a contract, (c) compliance with a legal obligation, and (d) legitimate interest. The specific legal basis which permits us to process your personal data may differ when you receive our services from an entity located outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and as a result the services and our processing obligations may be subject to non-EU data protection requirements.</p></p> <p><p>  As indicated above, we process personal data on a limited set of legal bases:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Explicit consent from the data subject. For example, by ticking a box on our website when you want to download product information.</li><li>Performance of a contract. This includes not only the provision of the services but also negotiating and signing a contract in order to receive a service.</li><li>Compliance with legal obligations applicable to us. For instance, preventing misuse of our services, cooperating with formal <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/legal/disclosure-requests/" target="_blank"> disclosure requests </a>, and retaining customer account data and financial data.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Our legitimate interest. This applies for example to direct marketing targeted to existing customers on an opt-out basis or to keep you updated on information regarding our services. Where we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is not high risk, does not involve the processing of special categories of personal data, and will not violate fundamental human privacy rights.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 2.2 Purposes.  </strong>The purposes for which we process your personal information depend on your relationship with us. For starters, you will be required to submit personal data related to you and the business you work for when creating an account. In addition, we may also require personal data in order to enable you and your End User’s (as applicable) to make use of our services. In other circumstances, we may process your personal data to conduct and expand our day-to-day business, such as for analytical improvements to the service, support, sales, marketing, and legitimate business purposes. Personal data can also help us improve the quality of our services and to develop new functionalities to fit the needs of our customers, such as product and experience personalization. In our <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/legal/dpa" target="_blank"> Data Processing Agreement </a> (DPA) we refer to these purposes combined as ‘legitimate business purposes’.</p></p> <p><p>  We only request personal data that is necessary to fulfill the specified purposes listed below as applicable to you; provided, however, if the nature of our relationship with you changes, we may need you to provide additional information. For example, if you fill out a form to request more information about one of our products, we will use your contact information to send the requested product information to you. If you then decide to become a customer, you will need additional information including your billing address for the purpose of account creation and providing you with the services.</p></p> <p><p>  The following is a list of purposes for which we may use your personal data. The specific purpose applicable to our processing of your personal data depends on the nature and extent of your relationship with us.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>To promote the use of our services in accordance with your marketing preferences.</li><li>To share relevant information about our products and services in accordance with your marketing preferences, including important notifications about the services.</li><li>To create an account connected to you and the company you represent.</li><li>To verify your identity.</li><li>To facilitate access and use of the services in line with the Terms.</li><li>Finance and billing, including fulfilling financial obligations such as paying taxes and ensuring invoices are paid.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To provide customer support and communicate with you about your account.</li><li>To analyze usage of our products and services.</li><li>For the transmission of information over the services; defining communications processing priority, routing configurations, and optimizing infrastructure.</li><li>To enforce compliance with the Terms and applicable law.</li><li>To keep our site and your account safe and secure.</li><li>To detect, prevent, and combat fraudulent or unlawful activity.</li><li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of us, you, our other customers, or any other third party.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>To meet legal requirements, including complying with court orders, valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal mechanisms.</li><li>To conduct questionnaires and surveys in order to provide better services to you, our other customers, and End Users; provided, however your participation in and completion of any questionnaires is always voluntary.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  We only request and retain personal data when strictly necessary. The data that we request will be relevant to our relationship and your purpose. For example, we require an email address to be able to send you marketing emails, but we do not need your gender or payment information.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 3. What personal data we collect and how </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The exact type of data we collect depends on the relationship we have with you and the product or service you use.

We obtain business data such as employment or professional information from third parties. This information includes email addresses, the company an individual works for, job titles, phone numbers, and URLs of LinkedIn profiles.

Information can be used to develop our business by updating, expanding, and analyzing our customer relationship records.</li></ul></div> <ul><ul>  <li>Third party social media providers. Depending on your and/or your End Users' privacy settings, third party social media service providers such as Google, Twitter, and Facebook can provide us with information about you or an End User, as applicable. However, if you or an End User connects to a social media page you may (depending on the platform) be presented with the option to decide whether or not you would like to share that information with us. Third Party Data may be combined with personal data that you provide to us. Information can be used to develop our business by updating, expanding, and analyzing our customer relationship records.</li></ul></ul> <div><ul>  <li>Third party services & connectors</li></ul><span>  . We make connectors available on the MessageBird Platform that will allow our services to be used in connection with third party services through APIs or other connectors. For the sole purpose of enabling and facilitating the connector, your information may be made available to or shared by our services with the relevant third party service (and vice versa).

When we ask you to provide personal data to us, you can decline. However, many of our products and services require personal data so your choice not to provide personal data in certain instances can prevent you from using a certain product, service, or functionality.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> End User personal data per service </strong></p><p>  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</p><p>  CATEGORIES OF END USER PERSONAL DATA INVOLVED</p><p>  <strong> SMS </strong></p><p>  Phone number, traffic data*, location related data**, communication content</p><p>  <strong> Voice </strong></p><p>  Phone number, traffic data*, location related data**, communication content recordings (optional)</p><p>  <strong> Email Services </strong></p><p>  Identification and contact data (name, email address, and other demographic and segment data provided by you); IT information (IP addresses, usage data, cookies data, online navigation data, location data, browser data); communication content.</p></div> <p><p>  <strong> Numbers </strong>(Local Numbers, Short Codes, Programmable Numbers API)</p></p> <p><p>  None. Please take the additional service into account that is used in combination with the Numbers service, such as Voice or SMS, to get the correct understanding of personal data involved, as applicable to you.</p></p> <div><p>  <strong> Inbox </strong></p><p>  Customer agent data, service/channel specific data</p><p>  <strong> Flow Builder </strong></p><p>  Email address, phone number, or channel ID contained in Flow Builder invocations created by the customer, service/channel specific data</p><p>  <strong> Video Engagement Platform </strong></p><p>  Meeting information:</p><ul>  <li>Meeting date</li><li>Meeting description</li><li>Meeting review (optional)</li><li>Meeting wrap-up (optional)</li><li>Audio and/or video recording of the meeting (optional)</li></ul></div> <div><p>  Guest information:</p><ul>  <li>Guest name</li><li>Guest email</li><li>IP address</li><li>Guest phone (optional)</li></ul><p>  <strong> Omnichannel Widget </strong></p><p>  Email address, phone number, channel identification, prefered channel of communication, IP address, traffic data*</p><p>  <strong> Conversation Channels </strong>(WhatsApp for Business, Google Business Messages, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Line, Twitter, Viber, WeChat)</p><p>  Phone number or channel identification, traffic data*, communication content</p></div> <div><p>  <strong> Push Notifications </strong>(Pusher RTC Channels Service and Pusher Beams Service)</p><p>  IP address, traffic data*, communication content</p><p>  <strong> CDP </strong></p><p>  Name, email address, job title, IP address</p><p>  * Traffic data is data that is processed for the purpose of transmitting communications, such as routing data, and data about the date, time, and duration of the communication. ** Location related data is data with which the geographical position of the carrier or the communication equipment can be determined on the basis of the supplier used.</p></div> <p><p>  Personal data is only shared with third parties when necessary or when legally required. Data can be shared with government authorities and affiliated businesses, including communications and technology service providers. Third parties must meet strict privacy and security practices.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4. Parties we share personal data with </strong></p></p> <p><p>  We do share personal data with third parties but only in limited instances. Regardless of whether we fulfill the role of data controller or data processor, when we share personal data with third parties we always make sure that the third parties we share any personal data with adhere to similar data protection and security standards as outlined in this privacy statement. There are five categories of third parties with which we may share personal data:</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>(Tele)Communications services providers;</li><li>Third party service and technology providers;</li><li>MessageBird Affiliates; and</li><li>Government authorities, when required to do so by law.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  <strong> 4.1 (Tele)Communications Services Providers </strong>. To provide you with certain products and services, we engage with telecom operators, aggregators, carriers, and other communications service providers for routing and connectivity purposes. In order to make sure the message you sent will reach the intended recipient regardless of their physical location, we use a global network of telecom providers. When it comes to the contents of electronic communications transmitted by communication providers, these operators, aggregators, and service providers are neither data controllers nor data processors because they act as mere conduits for the transmission of communication content. If communications services providers process any personal data for their own purposes (e.g. fraud prevention, billing, filtering, or legally required data retention activities) they act as data controllers.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.2 Third party service and technology providers </strong>. We share personal data with third party service providers, like analytics, data science, and fraud prevention service providers, as well as our cloud hosting providers. We never share information with a third party without vetting them in advance and having the required contractual, technical, and organizational safeguards in place. An overview of third party service providers can be found via the section ‘<a href="https://support.messagebird.com/hc/en-us/articles/4524524060305-MessageBird-Processors-Subprocessor-?_gl=1*swjm57*_ga*MTE0NDE1MzA2NC4xNjIxOTUyODk4*_ga_5YJ7WT147X*MTY1MjA4ODU0NS4xMDU1LjAuMTY1MjA4ODU0NS42MA.." target="_blank"> Approved Processors </a>’ of this privacy statement.</p></p> <p><p>  We do not sell any information to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. We use direct marketing technologies like Google Adwords, LinkedIn, and Facebook for our own internal business purposes. To find out more about how to manage your advertising preferences, please check out your cookie management settings, or visit the advertising settings in your web browser.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.3 Payment Service Providers (PSPs) </strong>.When you pay for our products and services,PSPs provide you with two ancillary services in addition to the basic provision of payment services: (a) Saved Payment Methods and (b) Auto Recharge. Stripe, Mollie, and Adyen are the PSPs that collect, process, and store all of your payment requests and do so as data controllers in their own right.</p></p> <ul><ul>  <li>Saved Payment Methods functionality allows customers to save financial information for a specific payment method on a consent basis for convenience reasons. The information necessary to provide this service differs depending on the selected payment method (for example, credit card, iDeal, or Paypal). For a credit card, you are required to provide the last four digits of a credit card number, the expiration date, and the name of the cardholder. For iDeal, you are required to provide the IBAN/BIC number and account name. For PayPal the only required information is your PayPal account email address.</li></ul></ul> <ul><ul>  <li>Auto Recharge functionality allows you to automatically top up your account balance if it falls below a minimum threshold predetermined by you. You can enable this ancillary service through a toggle button, by which you provide your consent for us and our PSPs to use your payment information to automatically recharge the credits on your balance. Your preferred bank may request extra authentication from you before you can use the Auto Recharge functionality.</li></ul></ul> <p><p>  For both of these ancillary payment functionalities you can withdraw your consent at any time on the customer finance settings page, <a href="https://dashboard.messagebird.com/en/finance/settings" target="_blank"> here </a>.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.4 MessageBird Affiliates </strong>. In order to do business with our global offices, we might need to share personal data between all of the companies in the MessageBird group. Both MessageBird B.V. and all of our Affiliates will only ever use the data as described in this privacy statement, the Terms, the DPA, and only to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 4.5 Government Disclosure Requests </strong>. We will not share your information with third parties outside of those third parties outlined in this privacy statement or without your permission, except when we’re legally required to do so and in accordance with our <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/legal/disclosure-requests/" target="_blank"> Disclosure Requests Policy </a>. As company policy, we will provide you with a notice in case a governmental authority requests information from us about you or your customers, unless this is explicitly forbidden by law. If authorities do not want us to notify our customers, we require them to explicitly reference the legal grounds that would prevent us from doing so in the disclosure request. We also push back any disclosure request to the extent we have a reasonable legal basis to do so. The <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/legal/disclosure-requests/" target="_blank"> Disclosure Request Policy </a> addresses circumstances in which we are legally obligated to respond to official government requests for disclosure of information and requirements we have set for government requests to be processed in accordance with our policy.</p></p> <p><p>  Sometimes, we need to transfer personal data to business partners located outside of the European Union. We have robust privacy procedures in place that we deploy as required to protect the privacy of individuals both inside and outside the EU.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 5. International transfer of personal data </strong></p></p> <p><p>  As a global cloud based service provider, the use of our services often involves the transfer of personal data to recipients and third parties both inside and outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We take care to ensure our partners regardless of location have sufficient safeguards in place to properly process and protect your personal data in line with our own data protection and information security standards.</p></p> <p><p>  One of the important steps we take when it comes to international data transfers involving third parties is due diligence and vetting. As part of the third party vetting process, we ensure that personal data will only be transferred to a third party located outside the EEA with the required cross-border transfer mechanism and safeguards in place. This means that when we engage a third party that is located outside of the EEA, we agree on the appropriate level of data protection, including additional contractual, technical, and organizational measures and the execution of a transfer impact assessment where necessary, to ensure the ongoing protection of the rights and freedoms of all individuals, inside and outside the EU. We consistently monitor changes to the international transfer mechanisms permitted under applicable privacy laws to ensure ongoing compliance with the international data protection standards.</p></p> <p><p>  Proper security measures are required for effective data protection. Our measures have been created with the highest standards of confidentiality in mind. We hold several information security certifications, including ISO27001 and SOC II.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 6. The data protection and security standards we apply </strong></p></p> <p><p>  Data security is paramount to MessageBird. We invest in state-of-the-art technology and thorough security screenings of our infrastructure and employees to minimize security risks. Additionally, depending on the platform, services, and products you are using, we hold multiple globally recognised information security standards for Information Security Management Systems, like ISO/IEC 27001:2013, SOC 2 Type II, and NEN7510 certifications just to name a few.. All of our hosting providers are ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and SOC 2 Type II compliant as well.</p></p> <p><p>  Since all our accounts to access our platform services are password protected (with optional two-factor authentication), you should be the only person with access to your account. You are responsible for safeguarding the credentials to your account. If your login information is stolen or used without your permission, it is imperative that you notify us immediately so we can take steps to secure your account. You can notify us of any unauthorized use of your account by sending an email to security[at]messagebird.com with the subject 'Urgent: account credentials'.</p></p> <p><p>  If you want to know more about the measures we take to keep your data secure, please review our <a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/security/" target="_blank"> Security web page </a> and <a href="https://support.messagebird.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413383848209-MessageBird-Security-Overview-" target="_blank"> Security Overview </a>. These documents contain information about the industry standard, administrative, technical, physical, and organizational safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access and use of your personal data.</p></p> <p><p>  The length of time that we retain personal data for is determined by a combination of legal requirements, instructions from customers, and the duration of time necessary to achieve the purposes for which the information was collected.</p></p> <p><p>  <strong> 7. How long we retain personal data </strong></p></p> <p><p>  The duration for which we are allowed to retain personal data depends on the nature and the purposes for which the personal data is processed. We retain personal data only to fulfill contractual or legal obligations applicable to us or the specific Affiliate you contract with (as outlined in the Terms).
