This directory includes a compilation of notebooks along with a utility
file for collecting data for mapping remote endpoints. 
These files pertain to Section 5.1 of the paper.
Here's a breakdown of what each file contains:

| File Name                                     | Description                                                                                   |

| Domain2Org (Exclusive domains).ipynb          | Used to find exclusive domains for particular device vendor                                   |
| Domain2Org (Netify Crawling).ipynb            | Crawl organization information from netify.ai                                                 |
| Domain2Org (Selenium Copyright Crawler).ipynb | Scrap organization information from the copyright                                             |
| Domain2Org (Selenium Privacy Scrapping).ipynb | Extracts organization information from the privacy policy or about page                       |
| domain2org_bash_openssl.sh                    | Bash script to extract organization information from TLS Certificate                          |
| domain2org_bash_whois.sh                      | Bash script to extract organization information using bash whois                              |
| Merge and Clean All Domain2Org Data.ipynb     | Merge organization information from different sources                                         |
| utils.py                                      | Utility file                                                                                  | 

Run all ```Domain2Org ***.ipynb``` and ```Domain2Org ***.sh``` files to
collect metadata for given domains/endpoints from different sources.
Merge data by running ```Merge and Clean All Domain2Org Data.ipynb```. 
Remember to uncomment any code line in the file (marked with ```\todo```) 
to save collect data for entire domain set or to save data in file. 

```bash
cd "code\Endpoint Mapping\First Party Mapping\"
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to html --no-input <"Domain2Org ***.ipynb>"
```

Also, update the chromedriver according to your system requirement.
